TITLE
RNA polymerase is poised for activation across the genome

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Regulation of gene expression is integral to the development and survival of all organisms. Transcription begins with the assembly of a pre-initiation complex at the gene promoter, followed by initiation of RNA synthesis and the transition to productive elongation. In many cases, recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to a promoter is necessary and sufficient for activation of gene. However, there are a few notable exceptions to this paradigm, including heat shock genes and several proto-oncogenes, whose expression is attenuated by regulated stalling of polymerase elongation within the promoter-proximal region. To determine the importance of polymerase stalling for transcription regulation, we performed a genome-wide search for Drosophila genes with promoter-proximally stalled Pol II. Our data reveal that stalling is widespread, occurring at hundreds of genes that respond to stimuli and developmental signals, indicating a role for regulation of polymerase elongation in the transcriptional responses to dynamic environmental and developmental cues. Keywords: gene expression, ChIP-chip, transcriptional regulation
