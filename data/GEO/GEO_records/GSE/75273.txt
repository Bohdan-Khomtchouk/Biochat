TITLE
Genomic response to environment affects tomato fruit organoleptic performance

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The environment has a profound influence on the tomato fruit organoleptic quality. The extent of which depends from a well-regulated and dynamic interplay among genes, metabolites and sensorial attributes. A systems biology approach, could be useful for elucidating complex interacting mechanisms regulating the plasticity of sensorial  quality properties.   In order to investigate the transcriptomic and metabolomic environmentally challenged remodeling and to evaluate organoleptic consequences of such variation, three tomato (Solanumlycopersisum) genotypes, Heinz 1706, San Marzano and Vesuviano were grown in two different localities. The metabolome and transcriptome analysis revealed common as well as genotype specific challenged pathways, the dynamic of which are in turn regulated by genome organization and gene diversity. When combined with sensorial data, through a network analysis, interesting aspects of fruit quality fine regulation were revealed: first, duplicated genes and different genes/isoforms and transcription factors have a dominant role in shaping environment response; second the lost or gained interactions and/or the changing position of a node is crucial for phenotypic expression of a given trait; third, sensorial traits as sweetness, turgidity and are much responsive to environment. The fundamental role of cell wall metabolism in tuning all the quality attributes was also highlighted.   Tomato genotypes, although activate the same fruit related quality processes, follow different transcriptomic, metabolomic and sensorial trajectories depending of their own genetic makeup.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different tomato varieties, Heinz, San Marzano and Vesuviano, in 2 Campania locations.
