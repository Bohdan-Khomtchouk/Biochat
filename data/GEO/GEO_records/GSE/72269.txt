TITLE
Differentially Expressed LncRNAs Might be Controlling Signaling Pathways by Establishing Interactions with mRNAs and MicroRNAs in Pediatric Astrocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study was determined the global expression pattern of long non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs in pediatric astrocytoma of different histological grades. The Affymetrix HTA 2.0 array showed expression changes on one hundred-sixty two and two hundred-fifteen long non-coding RNAs in tumors (versus the control) and in GBM (versus low-grade astrocytoma), respectively.

DESIGN
A total of seven astrocytic tumors and two control tissues were collected during the period of 2012â€“2014: four low-grade Ast (three pilocytic Ast (PAst) and one diffuse Ast (DAst)) and four high-grade Ast (four glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)).RNA was extracted from tissue samples using TRIzol (Ambion life technologies, Thermo Scientific Inc.) following the methodology described by Hongbao et al. 2008 and with certain modifications described by Vujovic et al. 2013. For expression analysis, Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed.  in this study was determined the global expression pattern of long non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs in pediatric astrocytoma of different histological grades. The HTA 2.0 array showed expression changes on one hundred-sixty two and two hundred-fifteen long non-coding RNAs in tumors (versus the control) and in GBM (versus low-grade astrocytoma), respectively.
