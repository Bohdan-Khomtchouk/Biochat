TITLE
Yeast HSF1 vs hsf1-ba1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Upon heat shock, Hsf1 protein is extensively phosphorylated, however, this modification is inhibited by an hsf1-bal mutation. To get genome-wide effect of the hyperphosphorylation on Hsf1-regulated transcription, the heat-induced gene expression profiles in HSF1 and hsf1-bal cells were compared. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HSF1 wild type and hsf1-ba1 cells grown at 39oC for 15 min. Probe cDNA was primed by oligo(dT) and was synthesized in the presence of 33P-dCTP. Hybridization was carried out using one GF100 GeneFilter filter set for GSM37978 and GSM76015 and other filter set for GSM76014 and GSM76016. Value higher than 30 in HSF1 wild type cells is confident. Fold changes should be calculated from GSM37978 and GSM76015 and from GSM76014 and GSM76016.
