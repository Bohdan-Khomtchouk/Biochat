TITLE
Yeast HSF1 vs hsf1-ba1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Upon heat shock, Hsf1 protein is extensively phosphorylated, however, this modification is inhibited by an hsf1-bal mutation. To get genome-wide effect of the hyperphosphorylation on Hsf1-regulated transcription, the heat-induced gene expression profiles in HSF1 and hsf1-bal cells were compared. Keywords: stress response
