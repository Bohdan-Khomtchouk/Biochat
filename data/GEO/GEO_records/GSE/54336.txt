TITLE
Expression data of A2EN cells during early stage of Chlamydia trachomatis infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen that causes trachoma and sextually transmitted disease in human. During early stage of infection, Chlamydia secreted bacterial effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm to help its entry and estabilishment of early replicated niche. We identified a Chlamydia mutant that lack an early Effector. To address the function of this effector, we infected A2EN cells with this mutant (G1V) and its complemented counterpart (G1TEPP) to see what host gene transcriptions are affected by this effector.

DESIGN
A2EN cells were mock infected, or infected with a Chlamydia mutant or its complemented counterpart for 4 hour post infection.
