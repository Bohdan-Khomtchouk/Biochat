TITLE
miRs  expression profile to predict HNSCC patients at high risk to develop recurrence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A miRs expression profiling of a total of 746 miRs (664 human + 82 viral) in 72 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tumors to classify patients at high risk to develop recurrences

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we screened a cohort of 44 HNSCC primary tumors, followed up for two years, for the expression of a total of 746 miRs, to identify a miRs signature that classify patients at high risk to develop recurrences

PLATFORM
GPL18410 NanoString nCounter Human miRNA assay (v1.1)
