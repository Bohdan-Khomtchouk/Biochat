TITLE
Small RNA profiling Tomato, wild tomato relative and series of introgression lines

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
High throughput sequencing was used to investigate the production of small RNAs from cultivated tomato cultivar M82 and  its wild relative Solanum pennellii.  In order to understand the pattern of inheritance of the samll RNAs, interspecific hybrids (F1 and F2) along with series of introgressed lines comprising precise short genomic regions from S. pennellii in M82 background were used.
