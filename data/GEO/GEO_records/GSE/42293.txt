TITLE
Vitamin C Stimulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
The emergence of drug resistance among tuberculosis (TB) patients is often associated with their non-compliance to the length of the chemotherapy, which can reach up to 2 years for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB.  Drugs that would kill TB faster and would not lead to the development of drug resistance could shorten chemotherapy significantly. In Escherichia coli, the common mechanism of cell death by bactericidal antibiotics is the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction.  Since ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is known to drive the Fenton reaction, we tested whether the Fenton reaction could lead to a bactericidal event in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by treating M. tuberculosis cultures with vitamin C.  Here, we report that the addition of vitamin C to drug-susceptible, MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains results in sterilization of the cultures in vitro. We show that the sterilizing effect of vitamin C on M. tuberculosis was dependent on the production of high ferrous ion levels and reactive oxygen species.  Although, this potent sterilizing activity of vitamin C against M. tuberculosis in vitro was not observed in mice, we believe this activity needs further investigation.
