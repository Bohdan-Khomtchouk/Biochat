TITLE
Kinetic gene expression profiles of chicken macrophage HD11 cells in response to endotoxin from Salmonella typhimurium-798

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
HD11 cells were stimulated with 1 ug/ml endotoxin from ST-798 for 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours Cells were harvested at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hrs post stimulation and RNA was isolated from these cells and microarray was conducted for these RNA samples using affymetrix genechips

DESIGN
The microarray experiment was conducted using three replications.  The first two replications each used one experimental unit and one Affymetrix GeneChip for each of the eight combinations of endotoxin dose (treated vs. control) and time (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours after treatment).  The third replication was analyzed with four GeneChips for four endotoxin-treated experimental units measured at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after treatment, respectively.
