TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Haloferax mediterranei based on nitrogen availability

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloferax mediterranei in three culture media with different nitrogen sources: a) cells were grown stationary and exponentially on ammonium, b) cells were grown exponentially on nitrate, and c) cells were shifted to nitrogen starvation conditions.  The main differences in the transcriptional profiles have been identified between the cultures with ammonium as nitrogen source and the cultures with nitrate or nitrogen starvation, supporting previous results which indicate the absence of ammonium as the factor causing the expression of genes involved in nitrate assimilation pathway.

DESIGN
Four-conditions experiment with four biological replicates, combined in a loop design.
