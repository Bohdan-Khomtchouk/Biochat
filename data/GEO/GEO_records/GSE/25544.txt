TITLE
Host/microbial cross-talk in the gut: In-depth investigation of the symbiotic effects of Roseburia hominis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we report analysis of both the bacterial and host transcriptome as affected by colonization of R. hominis in the mouse gut. Microbial genes required for colonization and adaptation in the murine gut, as well as host genes responding to colonization by this bacterial species, were uncovered.
