TITLE
DNA methylation dynamics during ex vivo differentiation and maturation of human dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomewide DNA methylation profiling of monocyte isolated from humna blood, immature and mature dendritic cells generated ex vivo. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchips were used to generate DNA methylation profiles.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 beadchips

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
