TITLE
Role of the endosomal TLR3, 7 and 9 receptors in anti-tumor immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression on day four and day six after tumor inoculation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences between wildtype and TLR knockout mice.

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression of tumor tissues obtained from wildtype and TLR-k.o. mice after injection with MOPC cells.
