TITLE
Comparative analysis of stylar canal cells transcriptome in clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina)

ORGANISM
Citrus clementina

SUMMARY
Compared to what is known in model species, reproductive biology in citrus is still poorly understood. Although in recent years several efforts have been made to study pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility, little information is available about the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes. We performed microarray analysis for the identification of candidate genes involved in pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility in clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.). The analysis was performed comparing the transcriptome of laser-microdissected stylar canal cells isolated from two clementine genotypes differing for self-incompatibility response (‘Comune’, self-incompatible; and ‘Monreal’, a self compatible mutation of ‘Comune’).

DESIGN
Styles with stigmas, collected 24 hours after self pollination, were immediately snap-frozen in OCT embedding medium (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands) in Peel-A-Way plastic embedding molds (Polysciences, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). Transversal sections 10 µm thick at the upper part of the style were cut with a Leica CM1900 cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Germany) at -20°C. A Leica AS Laser Microdissection system (Leica Microsystems) was used for the isolation of stylar canals from transversal sections. Canals from the stigma were discarded to avoid contamination with pollen or pollen tubes. Three biological replicates were prepared for each genotype. Each biological replicate consisted of bulks of about 200 microdissected areas (composed of an average of 50 cells) coming from two different molds
