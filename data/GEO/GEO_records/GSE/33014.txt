TITLE
Comparative analysis of stylar canal cells transcriptome in clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina)

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Compared to what is known in model species, reproductive biology in citrus is still poorly understood. Although in recent years several efforts have been made to study pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility, little information is available about the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes. We performed microarray analysis for the identification of candidate genes involved in pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility in clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.). The analysis was performed comparing the transcriptome of laser-microdissected stylar canal cells isolated from two clementine genotypes differing for self-incompatibility response (‘Comune’, self-incompatible; and ‘Monreal’, a self compatible mutation of ‘Comune’).
