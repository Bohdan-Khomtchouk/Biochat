TITLE
Inhibition of the PI-PLC by U73122

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-01_pi-plc What are the genes that are regulated by basal PI-PLC? Arabidopsis thaliana cells in suspension (5-days old). Cultivated in environment (middle) Gamborg+2,4-D. Added inhibitors 4 hr before extraction of the RNAs. We try to determine the role of phospholipases C ( PI-PLC) in the control of the basal expression of the genes of suspension of Arabidopsis thaliana. A first experience in which we used the edelfosine as inhibitor allowed us to identify numerous genes the basal expression of which is altered by this inhibition. We want to confirm these results with another inhibitor.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison - treatment variations
