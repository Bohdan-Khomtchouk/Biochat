TITLE
Gene expression following acute methamphetamine administration in selectively bred mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined NAc gene expression in a pair short-term selected lines bred for high or low response to methamphetamine (MA).  We sought to identify candidate genes preferentially expressed among individuals showing either large or small acute responses to MA.  Additionally, we sought to identify genes and networks differentially expressed by MA exposure within these divergent lines. Keywords: Short-term selected lines (STSLs), saline (SAL), methamphetamine (MA), nucleus acumbens (NAc)
