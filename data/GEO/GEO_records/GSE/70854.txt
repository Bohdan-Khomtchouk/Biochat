TITLE
Microarray analysis reveals differential effects of conjugated linoleic acid isomers in ritonavir-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To quantify changes in adipogenic gene expression in the presence of ritonavir (RTV) or tenofovir (TDF), and determine whether conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers (cis9,trans11 or trans10,cis12) can mitigate detrimental effects of antiretoviral drugs. Methods: Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray was used to investigate gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with (1) RTV, TDF or ethanol control, or (2) ritonavir +c9,t11-CLA, ritonavir+t10,c12-CLA or ritonavir+DMSO control. RT-PCR validation of Pparg, Adipoq and Retn was carried out. ELISA and DNA binding ELISA were used to investigate secreted proteins and Pparg binding to its gene response element. Oil Red O staining was used to investigate triglyceride accumulation. Results: No effect was observed for TDF. Expression of 389 genes was altered more than 5-fold in the presence of RTV. Down-regulated genes included Pparg, Adipoq, Retn, Cfd and Cidec. Pparg and Adipoq down-regulation were confirmed by RT-PCR. PPAR-γ binding to its gene response element, adiponectin protein secretion and triglyceride accumulation were decreased by RTV. t10,c12-CLA in the presence of RTV decreased the expression of Ppargand Adipoq in microarray and RT-PCR. c9,t11-CLA increased PPAR-γ binding to its gene response element. Both isomers increased triglyceride storage in the presence of RTV. Conclusion: Ritonavir altered genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid accumulation and glucose metabolism. Down-regulation of Pparg may be mediated by changes in Cepba and regulatory genes Pparg1c and Nr1h3.

DESIGN
3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with ritonavir (20μM; n=4), tenofovir (1μM; n=4) or vehicle control (ethanol 0.1%; n=4) for 5 days and in a second experiment with ritonavir (20 µM) +c9,t11-CLA (100μM; n=4), ritonavir (20 µM) +t10,c12-CLA (100μM; n=4) or ritonavir+fatty acid vehicle control (DMSO 0.1%; n=4) for 5 days.
