TITLE
Knockdown of transactive response DNA-binding protein TDP-43 downregulates histone deacetylase 6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein implicated in transcriptional repression and  mRNA processing. Inclusions of TDP-43 are hallmarks of frontotemporal dementias  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Besides aggregation of TDP-43, loss of nuclear  localization is observed in disease. To identify relevant targets of TDP-43, we performed  an expression profiling study. Thereby, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) downregulation  was discovered upon TDP-43 silencing on mRNA and protein level in human embryonic  kidney HEK293E and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. This was accompanied by accumulation  of the major HDAC6 substrate, acetyl-tubulin. Expression of wild-type but neither  RNA-binding- nor nuclear-localization-deficient TDP-43 restored HDAC6 expression.  Moreover, TDP-43 bound specifically to HDAC6 mRNA arguing for a direct functional  interaction. Importantly, in vivo validation in TDP-43 knockout Drosophila melanogaster  also showed HDAC6 mRNA decrease. HDAC6 is necessary for protein aggregate  formation and degradation. Indeed, downregulation of HDAC6 reduced aggregate  formation and increased cytotoxicity of expanded poly-glutamine ataxin-3 in TDP-43  silenced cells. This was completely restored by co-transfection with HDAC6. In  conclusion, loss of functional TDP-43 causes HDAC6 downregulation and might thereby  contribute to pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Comparison of TDP-43 knockdown in HEK293E cells against cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. 4 independend transfections per siRNA were used.
