TITLE
Genome-wide distribution of UHRF2 and ZNF618 in 293T cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have identified ZNF618 as a novel binding partner of UHRF2. We have found that UHRF2 and ZNF618 co-localize at many genomic loci.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide distribution of SFB-tagged UHRF2 and ZNF618 in 293T cells using ChIP-seq.
