TITLE
Molecular characterization of the genital organizer: Gene expression profile of the mouse urethral plate epithelium (GUDMAP Series ID: 51)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lower urinary tract malformations are among the most common congenital anomalies in humans. The urethral plate epithelium is an endodermal signaling region that plays an essential role in external genital development; however, little is known about the molecular identity of this cell population or the genes that regulate its activity. We aim to characterize differences in gene expression between the urethral plate epithelium and surrounding mouse genital tubercles during a crucial developmental period.

DESIGN
E12.5 transgenic embryos (Shhtm1(EGFP/cre)Cjt / Gt(ROSA)26Sortm3(CAG-EYFP)Hze) were harvested and the genital tubercle dissected from them. Shh expressing urethral epithelial cells were isolated from non-Shh expressing cells of the genital tubercle cells using FACS sorting techniques.
