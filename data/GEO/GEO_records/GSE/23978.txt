TITLE
Genomic Profiling of mouse mammary tumor models identifies miRNA signatures associated with mammary tumor lineage (primary tumors and normal mammary glands)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding, endogenous RNAs involved in many human diseases including breast cancer. miRNA expression profiling of human breast cancers has identified miRNAs related to the clinical diversity of the disease and potentially provides novel diagnostic and prognostic tools for breast cancer therapy. In order to further understand the roles of miRNAs in association with oncogenic drivers and in specifying sub-types of breast cancer, we performed miRNAexpression profiling on mammary tumors from eight well-characterized genetically -engineered Mouse (GEM) models of human breast cancer including MMTV–H-Ras, -Her2/neu, -c-Myc, -PymT, –Wnt1 and C3(1)/SV40 T/t-antigen transgenic mice, BRCA1fl/fl;p53+/-;MMTV-cre and the p53fl/fl ;MMTV-cre transplant model.

DESIGN
miRNA expression data for 41 mouse primary mammary tumors and 5 mouse normal mammary glands
