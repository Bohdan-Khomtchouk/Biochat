TITLE
ENCODE (HG17) region-wide binding of a few antibodies in IFg treated and untreated HeLa cells using nimblegen array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide location analysis of trimethyl-K4 histone H3 and RNA polymerase II binding in interferon gamma-induced for 30 minutes HeLa cells and uninduced HeLa cells was done using 50mer oligonucletide probes at 38bp intervals tiling over non-repetitive ENCODE regions (HG17, NCBI build 35). Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
There are three replicates for each marker at each state.

PLATFORM
GPL2533 Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array (HG17) with 50mer probe at 38bp interval for RenLab
