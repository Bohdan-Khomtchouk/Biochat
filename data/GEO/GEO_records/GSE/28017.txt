TITLE
Effect of ursolic acid on mouse skeletal muscle mRNA levels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of these studies was to determine the effects of ursolic acid on skeletal muscle mRNA levels in wild-type mice

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were allowed ad libitum access to standard chow or standard chow containing 0.27% ursolic acid for 5 weeks before gastrocnemius muscle RNA was harvested.  Each sample represents pooled gastrocnemius RNA from 2 mice.  mRNA levels in mice treated with ursolic acid were normalized to levels in untreated mice, which were set at 1.
