TITLE
mRNA expression pattern of KrasG12D mice with acute pancreatitis compared with wild-type mice without acute pancreatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic KrasG12D mice can recapitulate pancreas intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Caerulein is a cholecystokinin analogue and induces acute pancreatitis when injected intra-abdominally. Caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis will accelerate PanIN progression in KrasG12D mice. We compared mRNA profile changes between KrasG12D mice with acute caerulein-induced pancreatitis and wild-type mice without acute pancreatitis.

DESIGN
The experiment had two groups. Experiment group: KrasG12D mice with acute caerulein-induced pancreatitis (N=6). Three mice in experiment group received 1-week caerulein injection, and the other three mice received 2-week caerulein injection. All experiment group mice started to receive caerulein injection at 1-month of age, and were sacrificed at the last day of caerulein injection. Control group: wild-type mice without acute pancreatitis (N=6). The mice were sacrificed at 1.5-month of age. Whole pancreas tissue lysate samples were subjected to mRNA array assay.
