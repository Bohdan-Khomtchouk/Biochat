TITLE
Impact of Tcf1 and Lef1 deficiency on histone marks and Tcf1 binding in CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of epigenome and Tcf1 occupancy between control and Tcf1/Lef1-deficient CD8 T cells

DESIGN
Control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors (deleted by CD4-Cre) were used to isolate thymocytes. The thymocytes were surface-stained to identify TCRbeta high, CD69–, CD24– CD8+ subsets. These cells were sorted for ChIPseq  analysis of various histone marks. Control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 (deleted by CD4-Cre) were used to isolate thymocytes. The splenocytes were surface-stained to identify TCRbeta high, CD8+ subsets. These cells were sorted for ChIPseq analysis of Tcf1 binding locations.
