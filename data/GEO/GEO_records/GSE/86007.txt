TITLE
iPSC-Derived Cholangiocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human iPS cells were differentiated to cholangiocyte-like cells thorugh five phases of endodermal differentiation.

DESIGN
Human iPSC were generated by forced expression of the Yamanaka pluripotency factors. We then pursued a stepwise differentiation strategy toward iDCs, using precise temporal exposure to key biliary morphogens, and we characterized the cells,  using a variety of morphologic, molecular, cell biologic, functional, and in vivo approaches.
