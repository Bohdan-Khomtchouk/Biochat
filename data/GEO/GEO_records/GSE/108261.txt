TITLE
The spatial position of budding yeast chromosomes affects gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes can influence transcription. However, the frequency and magnitude of these effects is still controversial. To determine how changes in chromosome positioning affect transcription we characterized nuclear organization and global gene expression after large-scale chromosomal rearrangements in budding yeast. We used computational modelling and single cell imaging to determine chromosome position and integrated these data with genome-wide transcriptional profiles from RNA sequencing. Chromosome displacement relative to the nuclear periphery has mild but widespread and significant effects on transcription. Our study suggests that basal transcriptional activity is sensitive to radial changes on chromosomal position, and provides support for the functional relevance of budding yeast chromosome-level 3D organization in gene expression.

DESIGN
