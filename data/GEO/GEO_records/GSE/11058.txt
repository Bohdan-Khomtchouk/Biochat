Immune Cell Line Mixtures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray deconvolution is a technique for quantifying the relative abundance of constituent cells in a mixture based on that mixture's microarray signature and the signatures of the purified constituents.  Its ability to discriminate related human cells is unknown. Here we test the ability of this technique to determine the fractions of transformed cells of immune origin in mixed samples. Keywords: cell type comparison
