TITLE
Human acute myelogenous leukemia-initiating cells treated with fenretinide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) CD34+ cells treated with 5 μM fenretinide. Two timepoints included are 6h, 12h, covering the apoptosis-induction time window of AML CD34+ cells responsing to the fenretinide treatment. We studied gene expression series in human AML CD34+ cells with or without 5 μM fenretinide treatment by cDNA microarray analysis. Several signal transduction pathways are involve, including stress response, NF-kappaB inhibition and p53 inhibition (p < 0.05). These findings indicate fenretinide may represent a promising candidate for targeting AML-initiating cells.

DESIGN
6-condition experiment, untreated AML CD34+ cells vs. fenretinide-treated AML CD34+ cells,including 2 time points, for each point the untreated and 5 μM fenretinide treated, independently grown and harvested. Untreated was used to counteracting the background.
