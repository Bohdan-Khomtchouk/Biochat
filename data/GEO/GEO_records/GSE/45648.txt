TITLE
Anti-BRAF mutation drug resistance enhances EGFR expression in melanomas [expression profiling]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated melanoma cells with BRAF mutation with BRAF inhibitor and screened for BRAF inhibitor resistant cells. We extracted total mRNA from parental cells and resistant cell lines.  We compared their expression by carried out Affymetrix Huex 1.0 ST expression array.

DESIGN
Two paired parental/derived cell lines were screened as per the summary above. BRAF inhibitory resistant cells had gene expression compared to the parental cell lines.
