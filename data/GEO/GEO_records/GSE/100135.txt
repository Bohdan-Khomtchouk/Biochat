TITLE
Immuno-detection via sequencing (iSeq) for multiplexed and high-throughput protein detection in fixed cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We developed a sequencing-based immunodetection method which makes it possible to multiplex measurements of many different epitopes from proteins and phosphoproteins in a high throughput setting. With these DNA-tagged antibodies and dedicated sample preparation protocol, we studied the effect of hundreds of kinase inhibitors on 70 (phospho-)proteins in primary human skin cells.

DESIGN
We present an immuno-detection sequencing assay for multiplexed protein detection, based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of barcoded DNA-tags coupled to antibodies.
