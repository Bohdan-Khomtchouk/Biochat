TITLE
Liver profiles of mid-lactating goats using  Agilent Array

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Dairy ruminants are often fed high grain diets to meet the energy demand for high milk production. As a result, body metabolism occurs change and  milk quality was suppression. As the vital organ that controls metabolism, the liver contributes to the input of substrate precursors to the mammary gland. To further investigate the role of genes in feeding high concentrate diet metabolic characters, a comparison of mRNA expression profiles in liver of feeding high-concentrate diet (60% concentrate of dry matter, HC) and low-concentrate diet (40% concentrate of dry matter, LC) was carried out.When compaired with LC goats, 43 genes were significantly down-regulated and 112 genes were significantly up-regulated (fold change > 2 and p value < 0.01) in the liver of HC among the 115 probes. Through Co-expression network analysis to find K-core regulatory factors (genes). These genes were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses (n = 8), lipid metabolism (n = 5), protein metabolism (n = 26), carbohydrate metabolism (n = 7). These results were further described in the unpublished paper

DESIGN
Eight mid-lactating goats (LC, n=3;HC, n=5). Liver samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and then stored at -70 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. samples were named as LC1-3 and HC1-3, representing 3 respective liver RNA samples each from LC and HC goats. Microarray experiment was performed by a service provider

PLATFORM
