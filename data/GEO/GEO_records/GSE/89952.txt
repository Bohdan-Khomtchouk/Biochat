TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of murine T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas induced by HrasG12V, p53 KO and CIC loss-of-function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of T-ALL tumors derived from genetically modified mouse models: CIC loss-of-function, HRASG12V driven from the Kras promoter and Trp53 KO. Results provide insight into the role of the RAS/CIC axis in T-ALL development.

DESIGN
RNA-Sequencing of 5 CIC LOF, 3 K:HrasG12V and 4 Trp53 KO T-ALL murine tumor samples.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
