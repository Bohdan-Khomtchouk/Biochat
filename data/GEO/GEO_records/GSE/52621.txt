TITLE
Detection of hypermethylated circulating serum DNA in metastatic breast cancer and confirmation by the cMethDNA assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability to consistently detect cell-free tumor-specific DNA in peripheral blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer provides the opportunity to detect changes in tumor burden and to monitor response to treatment. We developed cMethDNA, a quantitative multiplexed methylation specific PCR assay for a panel of ten genes, discovered through whole genome methylation array analysis of serum DNA.  Cancer-specific methylated DNA was detected in training and test sets of recurrent Stage 4 patient sera with a sensitivity of > 90% and a specificity of > 96%.  A core methylation signature was retained in serum, primary and metastatic tissues throughout the course of the disease, and the cMethDNA assay levels reflected patient response to chemotherapy. Together, our data suggest that the cMethDNA assay can provide a sensitive tool to detect minute levels of tumor DNA present in a vast excess of normal DNA in serum.

DESIGN
Samples used: 11 cancer sera,,4 pools of normal leukocytes (5 donors per pool), 6 normal breast tissues microdissected, adjacent to tumor, 15 normal breast tissues, organoid preparations

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
