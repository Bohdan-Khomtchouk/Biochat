Expression data from human renal allograft biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kidney transplants that develop dysfunction or proteinuria after one year post transplant are at considerable risk for progression to renal failure. Identifying the molecules associated with graft failure could potentially lead to interventions that would slow the progression of organ failure. We analyzed the relationship between gene expression in late biopsies for cause in human kidney transplants and subsequent graft loss, and assessed the predictive value of gene expression. We evaluated the performance of these genes in an independent , and in a population of early biopsies that have a very low risk of subsequent graft failure.

DESIGN
All consenting renal transplant patients undergoing biopsies for cause as standard of care between 09/2004 and 10/2007 at the university of Alberta or between 11/2006 and 02/2007 at the University of Illinois were included in the analysis. In addition, biopsies obtained from Minnesota between 09/2006 and 09/2007 were used as an independent . In addition to the cores required for standard histopathology, we collected one core for gene expression studies. the relationship between gene expression in the biopsy and subsequent graft loss was analyzed.
