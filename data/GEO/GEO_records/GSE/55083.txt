TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis between a high and a low sulfite producers wine yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the expression level of the whole genome of two wine yeast strains highly differing in their sulfite production (High producer strain: 10281A; Low producer strain: 1764A). Conditions maximizing SO2 production were selected: nitrogen rich media (425 mg/l assimilable nitrogen) and low temperature (16Â°C). This transcriptomic analysis was performed during the sulfite production phase, just after the entry in stationary phase. This analysis is part of a global work, aiming at the identification of the molecular basis of sulfite production by wine yeasts through physiologic, transcriptomic and genetic studies.

DESIGN
Two strains compared in the same conditions with biological replicates following a dye-swap design.
