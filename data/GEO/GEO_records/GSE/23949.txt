TITLE
Identification of fusion genes in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of genomic copy number changes in breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3, KPL4 and MCF7 compared to a normal human female genomic DNA reference.

DESIGN
The experiment utilized four breast cancer cell lines; BT474, SKBR3, MCF7 and KPL4. All cell lines were grown in accordance with the distributorâ€™s instructions. All samples were hybridized once on 1M Agilent Human Genome CGH microarrays according to manufacturers instructions. Genomic DNA pooled from healthy female donors was used as a reference in all hybridizations. DNA from cell line samples were labeled with Cy5 and DNA from reference were labeled with Cy3.
