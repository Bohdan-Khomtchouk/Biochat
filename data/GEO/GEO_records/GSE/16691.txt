TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by Norrin-Frizzled4 signaling in the embryonic yolk sac

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of the embryonic yolk sac from embryos with ectopic Norrin expression were compared to their wild type littermate controls. The goal is to identify the transcriptional response to Norrin-Frizzled 4 signaling during embryonic angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Ectopic Norrin expression was achieved using a conditional over-expression strategy. Yolk sacs from 3-5 embryos were pooled for each sample and 3 replicates of both control and experimental groups were analyzed.
