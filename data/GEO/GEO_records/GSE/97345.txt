TITLE
Yeast RNA-binding protein Nab3 regulations genes involved in nitrogen metabolism

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Termination of yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts occurs through two alternative pathways. Termination of mRNAs is coupled to cleavage and polyadenylation while non-coding transcripts are terminated through the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) pathway in a process that is linked to RNA degradation by the nuclear exosome. Some mRNA transcripts are also attenuated through premature termination directed by the NNS complex.  In this paper we present the results of nuclear depletion of the NNS component Nab3. As expected many non-coding RNAs fail to terminate properly. In addition, we observe that nitrogen catabolite repressed genes are up-regulated by Nab3 depletion.

DESIGN
Yeast Pol II genome wide positioning before and after Nab3-FRB tagged nuclear depletion using Illumina HI-Seq
