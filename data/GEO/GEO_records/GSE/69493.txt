TITLE
Multi-dimensional histone modifications for coordinated regulation of gene expression under hypoxia  [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of epigenetic changes at hypoxia at gene level. The hypothesis was that different types of methylation affect gene expression coordinately regulate specific induction or repression of hypoxia-responsive genes.

DESIGN
genomic DNA obtained from adipocyte-derived stem cell subjected to 48 hours in hypoxic condition compared to normoxia condition.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
