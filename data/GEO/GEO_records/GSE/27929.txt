TITLE
Functional analysis of Kap1 genomic recruitment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A current model for the genomic recruitment of Kap1 is via its interaction with KRAB domain-containing zinc finger transcription factors. We have performed ChIP-seq for various mutant KAP1 proteins and shown that this recruitment mechanism mediates binding of KAP1 only to the 3â ends of zinc finger genes and that other factors are involved in recruiting KAP1 to promoter regions.

DESIGN
17 total ChIP-seq datasets; three different FLAG-KAP1 mutants, one FLAG-KAP1 wild type, and four different Input datasets from 4 different stable cell lines derived from HEK293 cells: 1 FLAG-KAP1 wild type dataset and 1 Input dataset done from HEK293 stable cells; 1 FLAG-KAP1 HP1BDmut dataset and 1 Input dataset done from HEK293 stable cells, 1 FLAG-KAP1 N-ter RBCC{delta}mut dataset and 1 Input dataset done from HEK293 stable cells, 1 FLAG-KAP1 C-ter PB{delta}mut dataset and 1 Input dataset done from HEK293 stable cells. One FLAG-KAP1 N/C-ter (RBCC+PB){delta}mut dataset done from T-REx HEK293 stable cells. One endogenous KAP1 dataset done from HEK293 cells. Two independent ELK4 datasets done from duplicate HEK293 cells. One endogenous Kap1 dataset and one Input dataset from a stable cell line derived from U2OS cells.
