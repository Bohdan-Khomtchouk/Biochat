TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of the LuxR-type regulator VjbR reveals novel insights into the Brucella virulence gene expression network

ORGANISM
Brucella abortus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of the Brucella abortus LuxR-type transcription factor VjbR

DESIGN
The analyses were performed with wild-type or vjbR mutant bacteria incubated under conditions mimicking the intracellular environment encountered by Brucella within the host cell.

PLATFORM
