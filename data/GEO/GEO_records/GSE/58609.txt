TITLE
Tet1 and Tet2 mediate epigenetic regulation of developmental genes by protecting DNA methylation canyons against hypermethylation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses whole-transcriptome sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF's). Two conditions were analyzed, MEF cells with intact TET1/TET2 enzymes (WT) and MEF cells with TET1/TET2 knocked out (DKO). Our results identify sets of differentially expressed genes which are correlated with TET1/TET2 induced methylation changes of the corresponding genes.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome analysis of M. musculus MEF cells. Two conditions were sequenced and analyzed, the first is wild type (WT), the second corresponds to knock-out of TET1 and TET2 enzymes.

PLATFORM
