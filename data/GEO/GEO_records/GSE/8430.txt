TITLE
Identification of EMT related genes in mcf10 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In vitro studies on immortalized breast MCF10A cells were additionally performed to assess the phenotypic and genetic changes associated to mesenchymal transformation of breast cells and to their epithelial plasticity. Keywords: breast cancer

DESIGN
To further study the molecular events associated to the cell plasticity of MCF10A cells, we decided to characterize the genetic programs modulated during the phenotypic changes by cDNA microarrays analysis. Cells were grown to 10-20% (sparse) or 80-100% confluence (confluent), and the corresponding RNAs were extracted and hybridized onto cDNA microarrays.
