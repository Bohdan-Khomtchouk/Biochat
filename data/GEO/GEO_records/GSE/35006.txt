TITLE
Profiling of p53-responsive genes in human breast cancer cells harboring endogenous ts-p53 E285K

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ts-p53 E285K protein is a rare p53 mutant with temperature-sensitive (ts) loss of function characteristics. In cancer cells, which express ts-p53 E285K intriniscally, endogenous wild type p53 activity is reconstituted by appropriate cultivation temperature (permissive condition). At non-appropriate cultivation temperature (restrictive condition) this p53 mutant is inactive. The present study took advantage of this mechanism and employed IPH-926 lobular breast cancer cells and BT-474 ductal breast cancer cells, which both harbor endogenous ts-p53 E285K, for the transcriptional profiling of p53-responsive genes. This new approach eliminated the need for genetic modification or cytotoxic stimulation to achive a p53 response in the cells being investigated .

DESIGN
Three subseqent passages of IPH-926 lobular breast cancer cells (harboring ts-p53 E285K) were seeded into two parallel culture dishes each and were allowed to adopt to restrictive and permissive condition for 24 h before analysis on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Subsequently, this experiment was repeated with BT-474 ductal breast cancer cells (also harboring ts-p53 E285K). To gate out non-specific temperature effects, the same experiment was also performed with MCF-7 breast cancer cells (harboring wt p53). Probe sets differentially expressed at restrictive versus permissive condition in MCF-7 were considered as non-specifically regulated. These probe sets were excluded from the final statistical analysis of  IPH-926 and BT-474 expression data. response to restored p53 activity
