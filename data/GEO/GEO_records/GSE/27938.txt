TITLE
Identification of differentially regulated genes upon overexpression of HLX in wild-type hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to study the role of Hlx in hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Sorted Lin-Kit+Sca-1+ cells from wild-type FVB/nJ bone marrow were infected with control (pCAD-IRES-GFP) or Hlx lentivirus (pCAD-IRES-GFP-Hlx) and cultured for 2 days in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing FBS, mIL-3, mIL-6 and mSCF with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 8ug/ml polybrene. Subsequently, GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three replicates of each, control vector transduced and HLX-transduced cells were used.
