TITLE
The differentially expressed genes of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 at different time after introduced fluoride

ORGANISM
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270

SUMMARY
The deleterious fluoride ions, which released from fluoride in uranium during its bioleaching, strongly influenced microbial growth, energy intake, enzyme activity and relative metabolism. Whole-genome microarrays were used to obtain a comprehensive description of the molecular response by A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 at 4.8 mM fluoride stress.

DESIGN
The experimental group was introduced 4mM fluoride at the mid-log phase. RNA from control samples were compared to the experimental samples taken at 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after fluoride added. It was used to analyze the genome-wide expression profiling at different time after fluoride was introduced.
