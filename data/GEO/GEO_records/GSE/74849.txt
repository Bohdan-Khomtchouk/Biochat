TITLE
Expression data from mouse calvarial suture mesenchymal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Axin2-expressing calvarial suture stem cells can contribute to calvarial development, homeostatic maintenance, repair, and regeneration. We used microarray to examine the gene expression profiles of Axin2-expressing suture stem cells and Axin2-negative cells in suture mesenchyme.

DESIGN
Three of Axin2+/GFP+ and three of Axin2-/GFP- cell samples were collected from mice carrying Axin2rtTA and TREH2BGFP transgenes. Each samples were isolated from 6-8 Axin2rtTA; TRE-H2BGFP mice and sorted by the GFP intensity.
