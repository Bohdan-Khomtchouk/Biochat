TITLE
The genes regulated by SOX11 in mantle cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genes regulated by SOX11 in MCL was investigated in MCL cell line Granta 519 by siRNA knock down system. Cells were transfected using the LONZA electroporation system. Results represent cells harvested after 20 hours. Details of the experiment is published in PMID 21124928.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (Human Gene 1.0 ST) of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line Granta 519 treated with SOX11 siRNA. Data analyses were performed using the Affymetrix Expression Console (v. 1.1)

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
