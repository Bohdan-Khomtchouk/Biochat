TITLE
Gene expression profile in the developing and adult mouse cochlear sensory epithelia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular control of development and regeneration in the mammalian cochlear sensory epithelia, we performed a comparative study of gene expression patterns between postnatal day-3 (P3) and adult stages using a microarrays approach.

DESIGN
Two inner ear development stages were used in this study, Post-natal day three and eight-week-old adult. A total number of sixty Swiss mice were exploited for each stage. The cochlear sensory epithelia (CSE) were collected from the inner ears and immediately placed in RNA later solution. A total of six independent dissection experiments were carried out separately in order to obtain three biological replicates for each stage. In each experiment, the CSE from 20 mice were pooled. Total RNA was purified from each biological sample separately using RNAeasy Mini Kit and the RNA integrity was assessed by the Nanodrop 2000
