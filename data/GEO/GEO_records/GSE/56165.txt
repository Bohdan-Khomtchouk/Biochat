TITLE
Characterization of gene expression changes in IRF4-deficient DT40 B cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of experiment was to study on genome-wide level IRF4 target genes in chicken DT40 B cell line, by comparizon of gene expression profiles of IRF4-deficient DT40 cells with WT IRF4 DT40 cells .

DESIGN
Total RNA from untreated IRF4-deficient DT40 B cells was compared with total RNA from untreated WT IRF4 cells

PLATFORM
GPL15357 Agilent-026441 Gallus gallus (Chicken) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
