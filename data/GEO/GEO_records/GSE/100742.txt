TITLE
Oxidative stress elicits a rapid and global RNA polymerase II transcriptional response in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In GSE93931, we used ChIP-Seq to show that hydrogen peroxide causes rapid accumulation of Pol II at promoters and enhancers. Over time, a fraction of accumulated Pol II loses NELF and creeps downstream. In GSE100740, we also compared nuclear walk-on results with PRO-Seq, both of which were performed using nuclei from DMSO- and flavopiridol-treated cells. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
