TITLE
Impact of maternal diet supplemented with selenium (Se) and vitamin B6 during pregnancy on gene expression of porcine expanded blastocysts (EB)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of porcine expanded blastocysts comparing control (EB obtained from 4 sows treated with basal diet) with either inorganic Se + B6 (EB obtained from 4 sows treated with basal diet plus inorganic Se and B6) or organic Se + B6 (EB obtained from 3 sows treated with basal diet plus organic Se and B6).

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, EB without and with maternal diet supplemented B6 plus either inorganic Se or organic Se. Four biological replicates for inorganic Se and three biological replicates and one technical replicate for organic Se. Pooled of four biological replicates for control group.
