TITLE
Expression data from human memory CD4 T-cells stimulated with autologous monocytes pulsed with HCMV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study reports an unbiased analysis of the genetic profile and regulation of NKG2D expressing CD4 T-cells.An Affymetrix microarray analysis was used to explore the genetic profile of NKG2D+ versus NKG2D- CD4 T-cells. The genetic profile was studied by single gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. I found that several immune regulatory receptors was regulated differently in NKG2D+ versus NKG2D- CD4 T-cells. Futhermore, I found that NKG2D+ CD4 T-cells display a genetic profile of cytotoxic T-cells. The gene set enrichment analysis revealed a change in 19 processes, including ARF GTPase activator activity; RNA splicing; Signal transduction; Interspecies interaction between organisms; Regulation of ARF GTPase activity; Cell motility; Mitosis; Cell cycle; Anaphase-promoting complex-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process; Induction of apoptosis by extracellular signals; Negative regulation of apoptosis; mRNA export from nucleus; Positive regulation of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity involved in mitotic cell cycle; Cell division; Protein polymerization; Spliceosome assembly; Microtubule-based movement; Immune response; mRNA processing.

DESIGN
Human CD4 T-cells were isolated from buffy coat by anti-CD4 conjugated magnetic beads. Memory CD4 T-cells were sorted, labeled with CFSE and stimulated with autologous monocytes pulsed with HCMV. HCMV stimulated CD4 T-cells were sorted as CFSE-NKG2D+ or CFSE-NKG2D- and processed for microarray analysis.
