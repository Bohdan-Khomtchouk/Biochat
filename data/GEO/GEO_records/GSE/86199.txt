TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Hes1 positive retinal subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze Mueller glia specific gene expression, Hes1-promoter-dEGFP mice was used. dEGFP positive and negative retinal fractions were purified by a cell sorter and subjected to RNA-seq

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression patterns in Hes1-positive (Hes1P) retinal cells and Hes1-negative (Hes1N) retinal cells at 2 developmental timepoints.
