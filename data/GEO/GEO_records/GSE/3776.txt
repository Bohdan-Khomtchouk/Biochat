TITLE
Comparison of Hematopoietic Stem Cell, Mast Cell Precursor and Mature Mast Cell Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are interested in comparing expression patterns of hematopoletic stem cells, mast cell precursors and mature mast cells. Our group recently reported that murine mast cells express CD34, Sca-1 and c-kit. Microarray analysis may uncover other novel surface antigens useful in separating mast cells from stem cells. Keywords: other

DESIGN
this experiment include 2 samples and 12 replicates
