Normalized and summarized data Data processing protocol Background subtraction and normalization Background subtraction and normalization was performed using the Quantarray Normalization Excel macro on individual quantitation output files. Each channel was background subtracted using the equation: ch Bkg. Subtr. Intensity = ch intensity - ch Bkg. Normalization strategy: total array Normalization algorithm: log ratio median centering Median log ratio = median(log2(ch1 Bkg. Subtr. Intensity) - log2(ch2 Bkg. Subtr. Intensity)) Normalization factor = 2^ median log ratio Normalized ch2 intensity = ch2 intensity*Normalization factor Statistical Analysis The background subtracted normalized intensities were used for statistical analysis. All spot intensities for within-chip, repeat hybridization, fluor-flip hybridization and biological replicates for each time point post-infection were compiled and tested for significance testing using the software package ArrayStat v.1.0, Imaging Research.
