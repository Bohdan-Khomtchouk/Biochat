TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of brown adipose tissue during cold exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied a deep-sequencing based method â€“ digital gene expression profiling (DGEP), to investigate gene expression in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in acute cold exposure

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression level in 3 different adipose tissues in 3 time points, day0, day2 and day4 in cold exposure.
