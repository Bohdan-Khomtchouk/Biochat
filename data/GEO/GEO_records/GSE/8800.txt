TITLE
Expression data from embryos injected with DrC1q-like morpholino and control morpholino

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Except complement C1q, the immunological functions of other C1q family members have remained unclear. In vitro studies showed that DrC1q-like could inhibit the apoptosis induced by ActD and CHX in EPC cells, through repressing the activation of caspase 3/9. Moreover, its physiological roles were studied by morpholino-mediated knockdown in zebrafish embryogenesis We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression of DrC1q-like deficient embryos and control embryos. And identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in DrC1q-like deficient embryos. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were selected at 24hpf for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain expression profiles of DrC1q-like deficient embryos compared to the control. And we could find out which genes and pathways were affected by DrC1q-like
