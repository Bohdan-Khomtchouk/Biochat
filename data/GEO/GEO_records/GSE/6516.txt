TITLE
Silverleaf whitefly 2nd instar feeding on 7-week old Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Phloem-feeding pests cause extensive crop damage throughout the world yet little is understood about how plants perceive and defend themselves from these threats. The silverleaf whitefly (SLWF; Bemisia tabaci type B) is a good model for studying phloem-feeding insect-plant interactions as SLWF nymphs cause little wounding and have a long, continuous interaction with the plant. Using the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip, the global responses to Silverleaf Whitefly 2nd instar feeding were examined. Keywords: stress response
