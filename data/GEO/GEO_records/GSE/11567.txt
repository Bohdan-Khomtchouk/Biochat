TITLE
GPR30-mediated estrogen signaling in Estrogen Receptor alpha and beta negative SKBR3 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses were carried out to identify genes regulated by 17-beta estradiol (E2) and Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) through GPR30 in SKBR3 cells, a breast cancer cell-line which expresses GPR30 but lacks Estrogen Receptor alpha or beta. Keywords: Gene expression analysis, Non-genomic signaling in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression analyses were done for control transfected SKBR3 cells: 1) Uninduced, 2) Induced with 10 microM OHT,  3) Induced with 1 microM E2 and 4) GPR30-antisense transfected cells induced with 10 microM OHT. The cells were induced for 1h and all the samples were collected in triplicates.
