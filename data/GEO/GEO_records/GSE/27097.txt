TITLE
Pediatric age-associated DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation (DNAm) plays diverse roles in human biology, but this dynamic epigenetic mark remains far from fully characterized. Although earlier studies uncovered loci that undergo age-associated DNAm changes in adults, little is known about such changes during childhood. Despite profound DNAm plasticity during embryogenesis and early development, monozygotic twins show indistinguishable childhood methylation, suggesting DNAm is highly coordinated during the pediatric period. Here we examine the methylation of 27,578 CpG dinucleotides in peripheral blood DNA from 398 boys, aged 3 to 17 years, and find significant age-associated changes in DNAm at 2,078 loci. We report a deficit of such loci on the X chromosome, a preference for specific nucleotides immediately surrounding the interrogated CpG dinucleotide, and a primary association with developmental and immune ontological functions. These pediatric age-associated loci overlap significantly with those previously identified in adults (p < 0.001) but most of the pediatric loci are unique, suggesting many are childhood-specific. Meta-analysis (n = 1080) with two adult studies reveals that the methylation changes in 29.5% of the age-associated pediatric loci follow a linear pattern from childhood into adulthood; however, we also find a three-fold higher rate of change in children compared with adults and that a higher proportion of lifelong changes are more accurately modeled as a function of logarithmic age. We therefore conclude that DNAm changes occur more rapidly during childhood and are imperfectly accounted for by statistical corrections that are linear in age, further suggesting that future DNAm studies are matched closely for age.

DESIGN
Age associated DNA methylation was evaluated at each CpG locus using a fixed-effects linear regression model adjusting for BeadChip as a covariate to account for batch effects. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for each CpG locus to assess the age affect at each CpG locus which was subsequently corrected for multiple hypotheses using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR.
