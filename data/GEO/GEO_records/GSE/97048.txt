TITLE
Flicr, a long noncoding RNA modulating Foxp3 expression and autoimmunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray profiles of splenic Tregs and Tconvs from Flicr WT and KO mice

DESIGN
DAPI-CD4+TCRb+ CD25- (Tconvs) and CD25hi (top 50%) Tregs were single sorted from the spleen of male NOD mice. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol method followed by amplification and cDNA preparation. cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix ST1.0 microarrays.
