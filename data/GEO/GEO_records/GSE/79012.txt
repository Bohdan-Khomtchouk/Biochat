TITLE
Gene expression profiling shows that combination of jazQ and phyB-9 mutations promotes additive and enhanced expression of growth- and defense-related genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The quintuple jaz mutant jazQ and the phytochrome mutant phyB-9 affect plant growth and defense. We used RNA-sequencing to query the transcriptomes of jazQ and phyB-9, as well as the combined jazQ phyB-9 sextuple mutatant, and examined how these mutations alter the expression of growth- and defense-associated genes. The data highlight how jasmonate and light signaling pathways contribute to growth and defense, and how their removal genetically promotes additive responses.

DESIGN
Analysis of Col-0 (wildtype), jazQ, phyB-9, and jazQ phyB-9 (four genotypes), with three biological replicates per genotype - 12 total samples.

PLATFORM
