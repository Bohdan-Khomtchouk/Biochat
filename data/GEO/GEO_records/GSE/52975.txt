TITLE
Integrative AUF1 PAR-CLIP analysis uncovers AUF1 roles in translation and genome integrity (RNA-Seq 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that AUF1 modulates global mRNA stability and translation, in turn promoting the maintenance of DNA integrity.

DESIGN
Please see individual series. In short, for AUF1 PAR-CLIP, the four isoforms of AUF1 (p37, p40, p42, and p45) tagged with a Flag epitope were expressed in HEK293 cells. For total RNA-Seq HEK293 cells were transfected with Control siRNA, AUF1 siRNA, Empty Vector, Flag-AUF1 p37, p40, p42, or p45 as well as WI-38 cells were collected at PDL 15 and 55 and also transfected with Control siRNA, AUF1 siRNA, HuR siRNA. For Ribo-Seq HeLa cells were transfected with Control siRNA, AUF1 siRNA, or HuR siRNA.
