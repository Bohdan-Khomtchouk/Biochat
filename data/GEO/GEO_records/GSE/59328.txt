TITLE
Genome wide analysis of bivalent domains in two HUES cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem (HUES) cells are derived from early individual embryos with unique genetic properties. However, how their epigenetic status might affect their potential to differentiate toward specific lineages remains a puzzling question.   Using ChIP-on-chip, the status of bivalent domains on gene promoters (i.e. H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation) was monitored for both undifferentiated and BMP2 induced cardiac committed cells. A marked difference in the epigenetic profile of HUES cell lines was observed and this was correlated to the pattern of gene expression induced by BMP2 as well as to their potential to generate cardiac progenitors and differentiated myocytes. Thus, the epigenetic H3trimeK4 and H3trimeK27 prints generating bivalent domains on promoters, could be used to predict a preference in their differentiation toward a specific lineage.

DESIGN
Using ChIP-on-chip, the status of bivalent domains on gene promoters (i.e. H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation) was monitored for both undifferentiated and BMP2 induced cardiac committed cells.
