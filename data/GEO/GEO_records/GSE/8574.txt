TITLE
Mouse embryonic stem cell line R1 differentiation study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell line R1 (Mouse embryonic stem cell line) was cultured on 3 different conditions for differentiation study. The experiment ran for 7 days and samples were taken every 24hrs. Afterward, samples on days 0,3,5 and 7 were processed for microarray analysis. The conditions were the differentiation of the stem cells for 7 days through a)formation of embryoid bodies, b)culture on a gelatin coated surface and c) culture on a matrigel coated surface. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
10 samples, considering: days 3, 5 and 7 for each of the 3 differentiating conditions and one for day zero. Technical replicates were made every three sample points. 3 Complete biological replicates were performed.
