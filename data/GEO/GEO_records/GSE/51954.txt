TITLE
Epigenome analysis of human epidermal and dermal samples with aging and sun exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of epidermal and dermal samples obtained from sun-exposed and sun-protected body sites from younger ( < 35 years old) and older ( > 60 years old) individuals. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in dermal and epidermal samples. Samples included 10 younger sun protected dermal samples, 10 younger sun exposed dermal samples, 10 older sun protected dermal samples, 10 older sun exposed dermal samples, 9 younger sun protected epidermal samples, 9 younger sun exposed epidermal samples, 10 older sun protected epidermal sample, 10 older sun exposed epidermal samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 78 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
