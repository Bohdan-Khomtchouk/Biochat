TITLE
Genome-wide Profiling of Steroid Receptor Coactivator 2 in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Steroid Receptor 2 (SRC-2) is a coactivator involved in hepatic metabolism.  To better understand its temporal involvement in metabolism genome wide profiling was performed at 2 time ZT4 and ZT18 as well as in the SRC-2 knockout mouse.

DESIGN
SRC-2 ChIP-Seq at two time ZT4 and ZT18 and in the SRC-2 knockout mouse liver

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
