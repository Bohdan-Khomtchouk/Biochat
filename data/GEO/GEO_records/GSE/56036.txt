TITLE
microRNA microarray on a cohort study of platinum-sensitive versus platinum-resistant NSCLC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify microRNAs that regulate therapeutic resistance, we conducted a high-throughput miRNA microarray on a cohort study of primary NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) tissues and adjacent normal tissues. We found some microRNAs related to therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis.

DESIGN
In this study, the patients who were diagnosed with resected NSCLC (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) were enrolled. All tumors were reviewed by pathologists and were pathologically diagnosed according to the World Health Organisation Classification of Tumors. Twenty-nine patients who received four or more courses of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy after postoperative recurrence were divided into two groups (responder (n=17) and non-responder group (n=12)). As identified by ANOVA analysis and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of 4 groups, some miRNAs exhibited significant expression changes.
