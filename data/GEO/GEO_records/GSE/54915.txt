TITLE
Analysis of genes regulated by Akirin and Brahma upon IMD pathway activation in drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This micro-array helps establishing the function of Akirin, a nuclear protein with unknown domains, a putative interacting partner, in the transcriptional regulation of the targets of Relish, a NF-kB factor required to fight Gram(-) bacteria infection in Drosophila melanogaster.

DESIGN
S2 cells were knocked down for Relish, Akirin and immune-challenged by Calcium-phosphate transient transfection of dsRNA and over-expressing PGRP-LC vector. Positively transfected cells were sorted by co-expressed Tomato and RNA was purified and analysed by a micro-array
