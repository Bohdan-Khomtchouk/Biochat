TITLE
Different Temporal Effects of Ebola Virus VP35 and VP24 Proteins on Global Gene Expression in Human Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate the effect on gene exression of mutations in Ebola virus inate immune response antagonizing  domains (IRAD). Methods: RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of dendritic cells 8 and 24 hours post infection

DESIGN
Human dendritic cells are infected with wild-type Ebola viruses and viruses  harboring mutations in IRADs. Gene expression levels at 8 and 24 hours post infections were compared to mock infected cells.
