TITLE
Microarray analysis of mice with thyroid hormone receptor and RAS mutations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array was used to study gene expression profiles in three groups of mice: with thyroid hormone receptor ThrbPV (ThrbPV/PV) mutation only, with RAS mutation (KrasG12D) only, and with both ThrbPV/PV and KrasG12D mutations.

DESIGN
Three groups mice: with thyroid hormone receptor ThrbPV (ThrbPV/PV) mutation only, with RAS mutation (KrasG12D) only, and with both ThrbPV/PV and KrasG12D mutations.   Each group has three biological replicates.
