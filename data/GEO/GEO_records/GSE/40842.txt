TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profilling between iPS vs SSEA-1 positive or SSEA-1/3 negative sorted N417 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To prove that hypoxia generates Cancer stem cells (CSCs) from non-CSCs, we needed to separate out already existing tumorigenic cells from the cell population. To identify CSCs, we used ES cell-specific cell surface antigens (SSEA-1, -3, -4, and Tra1-81) on the assumption that the immature cell fraction would be rich in CSCs. We analyzed the expression levels of such embryonic antigens and stemness genes in cells exposed to hypoxia.

DESIGN
iPS (253G1), SSEA-1 positive-N417 3 of SSEA-1/3 double negative-N417, each condition is represented by 3 biological replicates
