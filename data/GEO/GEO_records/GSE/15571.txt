TITLE
Gene Expression Changes Induced by Bacterial Superantigen, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, serious systemic illness caused by bacterial superantigens (BSAg). We characterized the early molecular events underlying TSS using our HLA-DR3 transgenic mouse model and studied gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays.
