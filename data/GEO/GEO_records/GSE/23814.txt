TITLE
miRNA Profiling of Androgen Receptor and Vitamin D Receptor Mediated Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of miRNA profiles using Agilent Human miRNA arrays.

DESIGN
Four independent experiments were carried out in LNCaP cells, which were treated with ethanol control (no exogenous androgen), 5nM testosterone, 100nM 1,25(OH)2D3, and the combination of testosterone and 1,25(OH)2D3. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates using QIAGEN miRNeasy mini kit after 48h of treatment. The samples were run on Agilent Human miRNA microarrays that measure the expression levels of 866 human miRNAs from the Sanger database v12.0.
