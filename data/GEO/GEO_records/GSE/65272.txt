TITLE
Bacillus subtilis WalR (YycF) ChIP-chip  Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis ; Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Identification of the specific WalR (YycF) binding regions on the B. subtilis chromosome during exponential and phosphate starvation growth phases. The data serves to extend the WalRK regulon in Bacillus subtilis and its role in cell wall metabolism, as well as implying a role in several other cellular processes.

DESIGN
For each sample analyzed in this study three biological replicates were performed. Three different samples were taken from a strain expressing the WalR-SPA protein as well as from wild-type (168) without a tagged WalR. Samples were taken from exponentially growing cells in low phosphate medium (LPDM) as well as from phosphate-limited cells (T2). Each sample compares ChIP DNA vs. Total DNA from the same cells.
