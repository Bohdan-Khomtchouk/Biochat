TITLE
Affymetrix Cotton Genome array expression data of cotton fiber at different developmental stages from different varieties of Gossypium hirsutum

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Cotton fiber were used for the expression analysis at different developmental stages Affymetrix Cotton Genome array were used for the global profiling of gene expression of cotton fiber at different developmental stages

DESIGN
Six developmental stages (0 DPA, 6DPA,9DPA,12DPA,19DPA and 25DPA) of cotton fiber were selected for gene expression studies. The Gene expression profiling of these developmental stages were comparatively analysed in five different genotypes of Gossypium hirsutum. The genotypes namely JKC 725 and JKC 777 were superior in fiber traits as compared to genotypes JKC 703, JKC 737 and JKC 783. Total RNA were extracted from these varieties at six developmental stages. Biotinylated cRNA were synthesized and hybridized on Affymetrix Cotton Genome array according to manufacturer protocol (Affymetrix).Three biological replicates samples were isolated from each developmental stages from five genotypes.
