TITLE
Variations in stress sensitivity and genomic expression in diverse S. cerevisiae strains (CGH)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression variation was measured in 17 non-laboratory strains compared to the sequenced S288c lab strain Keywords: comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH) comparing different yeast strains
