TITLE
mTAIL-seq reveals dynamic poly(A) tail regulation in oocyte-to-embryo development [RNA-seq Drosophila oocyte stages]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to multiple types of tailing which critically influence mRNA stability and translatability. To investigate RNA tails at the genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this study, we report a new version of TAILseq (mRNA TAIL-seq or mTAIL-seq) with enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by ~1000 fold compared to the previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of poly(A) tail in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs are polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs with a few intriguing exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAILseq data with ribosome profiling data, we find a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that regulation of poly(A) tail in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems.

DESIGN
Two sets of RNA-seq on 3 developmental stages (immature oocyte, mature oocyte, and activated egg) of wild type and wispy mutant of Drosophila melanogaster.
