TITLE
Expression data from NSCs treated with REST inhibitor X5050

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
REST has been initially described as a repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by binding to its recognition sequence RE1. Over-activation of this factor has been shown in several diseases such as Huntington disease or central nervous system cancers. High-throughput screening of a library of 6,984 compounds with luciferase-assay measuring REST activity in neural derivatives of human embryonic stem cells led to the identification of one benzoimidazole-5-carboxamide derivative (X5050) that inhibited REST silencing in a RE1-dependent manner. Differential transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of neuronal genes targeted by REST.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 6 samples, corresponding to 3 independent cultures of NSC SA-01, each one treated either with DMSO (0.1 % final) or with X5050 (100 ÂµM final). RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit with DNase I digestion and genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed by hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
