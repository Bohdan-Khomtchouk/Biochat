TITLE
A profile of murine thymocytes from mice hypomorphic for Atg16l1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to survey global gene expression of total thymocytes from wild-type mice and Atg16l1 mutant (hypomorph) mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from total thymocytes from the following samples and analyzed: Atg16l1 hypomorph: 2 mice (7 weeks), 1 male and 1 female Control: 2 mice (7 weeks), 1 male and 1 female Global gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix technology.  The animals used were independent of each other.
