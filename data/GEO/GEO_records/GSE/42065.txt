TITLE
A key role for a glutathione transferase in multiple herbicide resistance in grass weeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The gene encoding a protein (AmGSTF1) associated with multiple herbicide resistance (MHR) in black-grass was transgenically expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana.The goal of this study was to determine if AmGSTF1 could elicit an MHR phenotype in the transgenic host. Affymetix microarrays were used to detect changes in transcriptional regulation between amgstf1-expressors and wild-type Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Col0).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from amgstf1-expressors and wild-type Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Col0) respectively, grown under identical growth room conditions. Performed in biological triplicate.
