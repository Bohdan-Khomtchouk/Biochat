TITLE
Gene expression after deletion of Bmp4 in the mouse optic vesicle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bmp4 was conditionally deleted from the mouse optic vesicle with Rx-Cre. The heads of wild type and knockout E10.5 mouse embryos were laser micodissected to isolate the lens ectoderm and prospective retina from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN Ovation Pico WTA system V2 kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina Mouse6 V2 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three knockout embryos were used. RNA obtained from the lens ectoderm or prospective retina (distal optic vesicle) was pooled, amplified and used for microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the values from the 25-50 beads on each array.

PLATFORM
