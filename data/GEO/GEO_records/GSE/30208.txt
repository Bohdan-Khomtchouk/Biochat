TITLE
Genome-wide expression kinetics of children with T1D-associated autoantibodies compared to healthy matched controls I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To unravel genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of prospective venous blood samples from children developing T1D-associated autoantibodies or progressing towards clinical diagnosis.

DESIGN
63 peripheral blood RNA samples from 6 autoantibody-positive children (Case) and their matched controls (Control) were analyzed with Illumina Sentrix WG-6 v2 genome-wide arrays, in order to study the gene expression changes occuring during the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Each case child (positive for T1D-specific autoantibodies) was matched with a persistently autoantibody-negative control child, with the same HLA-DQB1 risk category, gender, and place and date of birth. Seroconversion is determined as the first detection of T1D-specific autoantibody/autoantibodies (ICA titre > 4 JDFU, IAA > 3.47 RU, GADA > 5.4 RU, IA-2A > 0.43 RU, ZnT8A > 0.61 RU).
