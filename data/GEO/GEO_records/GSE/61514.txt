TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Staphylococcus xylosus in the presence of nitrate and nitrite in meat reveals its response to nitrosative stress

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus xylosus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus xylosus is one of the major starter cultures used for meat fermentation because of its crucial role in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, which contributes to color and flavor development. Despite the long use of these additives, their impact on the physiology of S. xylosus has not yet been explored. We present the first in situ global gene expression profile of S. xylosus in meat supplemented with nitrate and nitrite. More than 600 genes of S. xylosus were differentially expressed at 24 or 72 hours of incubation. They represent more than 20% of the total genes and led us to suppose that addition of nitrate and nitrite to meat leads to a global change in gene expression. This profile revealed that S. xylosus is subject to nitrosative stress caused by reactive nitrogen species generated from nitrate and nitrite. To overcome this stress, S. xylosus has developed several oxidative stress resistance mechanisms, such as modulation of the expression of several genes involved in iron homeostasis and in antioxidant defense. Most of these genes belong to the Fur and PerR regulons respectively. S. xylosus has also counteracted this stress by developing DNA and protein repair. Furthermore, it has adapted its metabolic response—carbon and nitrogen metabolism, energy production and cell wall biogenesis—to the alterations produced by nitrosative stress.

DESIGN
Microarray was used to evaluate modification in the transcriptome of S. xylosus C2a strain in the presence (N) or absence (V) of nitroso compounds. Three biological replicates collected on separate days for each meat matrix and labelled following a dye-switch design; for each condition one labeling in Cy3 and one in Cy5.
