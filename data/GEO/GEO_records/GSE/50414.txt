TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of VprBP knockdown in DU145 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VprBP has been implicated in transcriptionally silent chromatin formation and cell cycle regulation, but the molecular basis underlying such effects remains unclear. To investigate the role of VprBP on gene regulation, genme-wide gene expression analysis is carried out in DU145 cells expressing either control shRNA or VprBP shRNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from mock- or VprBP-depleted DU145 cells

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
