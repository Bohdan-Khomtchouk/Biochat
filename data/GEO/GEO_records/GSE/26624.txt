TITLE
DGAT enzymes are required for triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplets in adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from WT and DGAT1,DGAT2-KO (D1D2KO) animals. mRNA was isolated from cells untreated (UNDIFF) or treated (DIFF) according to standard differentiation protocol for adipocytes (Harris, C, et al. JLR 2011).

DESIGN
12 Samples total: 3 biological replicates of 3 undifferentiated wild type and D1D2KO mice and 3 biological replicates of 3 differentiated wild type and D1D2KO mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
