TITLE
Expression profile of PITX2 overexpressed HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PITX2 is a homeodomain transcription factor that has a substantial role in cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. In this study we have characterized PITX2-regulating genes. These data provide an insightful perspective for further studying PITX2 function and mechanism of action.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment comparing HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP-NFLAG-PITX2c (sample) to HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 (control). Balanced-block design (each array has one sample replicate and one control replicate) with dye-swap, with 4 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
