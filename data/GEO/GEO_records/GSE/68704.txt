TITLE
Hyaluronan and TLR4 Regulate Alveolar Stem Cell Renewal and Prevent Severe Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The successful repair of alveolar epithelial injury is required to restore the integrity of gas exchanging regions of the lung and preserve organ function. Severe pulmonary fibrosis is the result of repeated episodes of epithelial injury, activation of fibroblasts, and matrix accumulation. Thus, impaired alveolar epithelial progenitor cell renewal could contribute to the progression of fibrosis. We provide evidence that expression of TLR4 and hyaluronan (HA) on Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) is necessary for self-renewal. Either deletion of TLR4 or HA synthase 2 leads to impaired regeneration of AEC2s, severe fibrosis and mortality, in part due to blunted production of IL-6. AEC2s from patients with pulmonary fibrosis have reduced cell surface HA, and impaired renewal capacity, suggesting that interactions between HA and TLR4 are key regulators of lung stem cell renewal, repair of lung injury and that severe pulmonary fibrosis is the result of epithelial stem cell failure. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of AEC2 cells from WT  and TLR4-/- mice.

DESIGN
AEC2 cells were flow sorted from either untreated lungs or the lungs 4 days after bleomycin from WT or TLR4-/- mice. RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
