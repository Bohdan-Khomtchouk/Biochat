TITLE
transcripomics on the arabidopsis root tip during phosphate starvation-Transcripomics on the Arabidopsis Root tip during phosphate starvation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The objective of this project is to identify genes that are expressed in the Arabidopsis thaliana root tip and that are early induced (or repressed) by phoshate deficiency. Seedlings were germinated and grown (for 6 days) on phosphate rich medium and transfered to either a phosphate poor medium (Pi- = 20uM Pi treatment) or a phosphate rich medium (Pi+ = 500uM, Pi = control). Fifteen and 60 minutes after transfer, the tip (~800um) of the primary root was cut under a dissecting microscope. About 100 root tips per condition were harvested and there mRNA was analysed with the use of microarrays.
