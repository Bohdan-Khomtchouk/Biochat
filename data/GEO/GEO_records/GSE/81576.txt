TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Eed knockout and Ezh2 knockout small intestinal crypts [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Polycomb-mediated gene repression plays an important role in adult stem cell maintenance. We knocked out (using the inducible AhCre-LoxP system) Polycomb genes Eed and Ezh2 in the intestine for 6 weeks, after which crypts - the small intestinal stem cell zone - were harvested and RNA sequenced. We found Wnt, Notch and cell cycle pathways to be affected in Eed knockout (KO) but not Ezh2 KO crypts. Direct targets of Eed were determined by comparing this data with ChIP-sequencing.

DESIGN
Small intestinal crypt mRNA profiles of 6 weeks-induced 12 weeks old Eed KO, Ezh2 KO and WT mice (all triplicates) as well as 10 days-induced Eed KO and WT organoids (duplicates) were generated by RNA sequencing over two runs and using IlluminaHiseq2000 and Hiseq2500.
