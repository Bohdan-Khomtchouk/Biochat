TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors reveals mTORC1 and mTORC2 specific regulatory networks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to growth factor and nutrient signaling.  Consequently, this kinase is implicated in metabolic diseases including cancer and diabetes so there is great interest in understanding mTOR regulatory networks.  mTOR exists in two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and whereas the natural product rapamycin only inhibits a subset of mTORC1 functions, recently developed ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors have revealed new roles for both complexes.  To examine the complete spectrum of mTOR responsive cellular processes, we compared the transcriptional profiles of mammalian cells treated with rapamycin versus the ATP-competitive inhibitor PP242.  Our analysis provides a genome-wide view of the transcriptional outputs of mTOR signaling that are insensitive to rapamycin.

DESIGN
Gene expression in mouse NIH3T3 cells was measured after 18 hour treatment with DMSO (control), 50 nM rapamycin, or 2 uM PP242.  Four independent experiments were performed for each condition.
