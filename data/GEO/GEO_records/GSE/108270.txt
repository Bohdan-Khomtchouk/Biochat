TITLE
RNAs associated with affinity captured LINE-1 ribonucleoproteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAs extracted from affinity enriched L1 RNPs were subjected to next-gen RNA-seq Manuscript in revision at eLife: Taylor et al.

DESIGN
Synthetic L1s expressed in HEK293T_LD from pLD401, pLD567, and pLD624 Synthetic L1s expressed from pLD401 were subjected to split-tandem affinity enrichement, via ORF2p-3xFLAG (1st) and direct IP of ORF1p (2nd) Synthetic L1s expressed from pLD567 and pLD624 were subjected to affinity enrichement via ORF2p-3xFLAG only

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
