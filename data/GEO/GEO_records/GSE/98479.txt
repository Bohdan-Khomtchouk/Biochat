TITLE
Modeling gene regulation from matched expression and chromatin accessibility data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We propose a statistical method to model gene regulation by paired expression and chromatin accessibility (PECA) data, which dissects the regulatory elements (RE) of the genome by modeling their interaction with general chromatin regulators (CR) and sequence-specific transcriptional regulators (TF) and consequent effects on transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
To generate RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data on the retinoic acid-induced mESC differenation at Day 6.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
