Gene Expression Analysis of ARC (NSC 188491) Treated  MCF7 cells

SUMMARY
ARC (NSC 188491, SMA-491), 4-amino-6-hydrazino-7-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-7H-pyrrolo-(2,3-d)-pyrimidine-5-carboxamide, is a nucleoside analog with profound in vitro anti-cancer activity. First identified in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of p21 mRNA expression, subsequent experiments showed that ARC also repressed expression of hdm2 and survivin, leading to its classification as a global inhibitor of transcription 1. The following Hu U133 plus 2.0 arrays represent single time point (24 hour) gene expression analysis of transcripts altered by ARC treatment. Arrays for the other compounds (sangivamycin and doxorubicin) are included as comparators.
