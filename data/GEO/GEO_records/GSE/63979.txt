TITLE
Analysis of long non-coding RNAs highlights tissue-specific expression patterns and epigenetic profiles in normal and psoriatic skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Together with the GSE54456 data, we usedÂ in total RNA-seq data from 99 lesional psoriatic, 27 uninvolved psoriatic, and 90 normal skin biopsies and applied computational approaches to identify and characterize expressed lncRNAs.

DESIGN
7 psoriatic, 27 uninvolved, and 8 normal skin samples
