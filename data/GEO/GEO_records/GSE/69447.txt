TITLE
Whole-genome microarray analysis of human skin fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Connective tissue growthfactor (CTGF/CCN2) is a matricellular protein induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and intimately involved with tissue repair and overexpressed in various fibrotic conditions. We have previously shown that keratinocytes in vitro downregulate TGF-beta induced expression of CTGF in fibroblasts by an interleukin-1 alfa (IL-1alfa) dependent mechanism. With this study we want to get a better overall perspective who fibroblasts respond on TGF-beta and in a TGF-Beta stinulated system, what effect addition of IL-1 alfa have. This to understand the expression of CTGF in human fibroblasts which in turn have implications for the pathogenesis of fibrotic conditions involving the skin.

DESIGN
Microarray was performed on human skin fibroblast RNA from one patient, Fibroblasts were seeded in vitro as a control (Control, C), TGF-beta were added to fibroblasts and incubated for 16 h (addition of TGF-beta, T) and  both IL-1alfa and TGF-beta were added to fibroblasts for 16 h (addition of IL-1alfa and TGF-beta, IT). Each condition (C,T and IT) were done in three replicates.
