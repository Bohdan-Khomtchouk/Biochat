TITLE
Expression data from one-year-old leaves of Populus simonii treated with short-term water deficit

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We take one-year-old plants for short-term water deficit treatments and controls. We use the Affymetrix Poplar GeneChip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves and detail the global program of gene expression during water deficit treatments.
