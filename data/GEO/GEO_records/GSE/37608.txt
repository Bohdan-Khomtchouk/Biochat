TITLE
Expression data from one-year-old leaves of Populus simonii treated with short-term water deficit

ORGANISM
Populus simonii

SUMMARY
We take one-year-old plants for short-term water deficit treatments and controls. We use the Affymetrix Poplar GeneChip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves and detail the global program of gene expression during water deficit treatments.

DESIGN
Populus simonii leaves were taken from short-term water-deficit-treated plants and control plants for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. D1 and D2 are from water-deficit-treated plants, CK1 and CK2 are controls.
