TITLE
Up-regulation of prolactin receptor in the proximal tubular cells in cardio-renal syndrome model mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The precise physiological mechanisms of cardio-renal syndrome are yet to be elucidated. In order to investigate the molecular basis of cardio-renal syndrome, we established a mouse model for cardio-renal syndrome by the combination of abdominal aortic banding and uninephrectomy. Renal function of the cardio-renal syndrome mice was synergistically decreased compared with that of mice that underwent uninephrectomy alone. To investigate the molecules involved in the deterioration renal function in the AbNx mice, we conducted  comprehensive gene expression analysis using DNA array by comparing the molecules expressed in the remained kidney of AbNx mice with those of Nx mice.

DESIGN
We conducted abdominal aorta banding or sham operation at 0 week, then We conducted uninephrectomy or sham operation at 2 week. We removed these kidney 6week after the uninephrectomy. These RNA samples were purified from the homogenized kidneys.
