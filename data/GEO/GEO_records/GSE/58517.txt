TITLE
Detection of urinary microRNAs from epithelial ovarian cancer patients as biomarker

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Urine RNA from 5 ovarian cancer and 5 healthy control were analyzed with the Human miRNA Microarray and then validated with a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assay with 29 individual samples, 20 benign gynecological disease and 26 age/sex-matched healthy control. This study determines the clinical value of urine miRNAs as biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer. Results: The miRNA microarray results demonstrate that the original 38 were identified that were significantly differentially expression in epithelial ovarian cancer compared with healthy control (P < 0.01). A total of 1 miRNA was up-regulated in ovarian cancer, while 37 miRNA were down-regulated.

DESIGN
the urine RNA from 5 ovarian cancer and 5 healthy women were analysised with Human mirRNA microarry
