TITLE
Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reduce Inflammation while Enhancing Bacterial Clearance and Improving Survival in Sepsis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from Total RNA extracted from murine spleen. Sepsis was induced in C57Bl/6J mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), followed 6 hours later by an intravenous injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) or saline.  Twenty-eight hours after CLP, plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissues were collected for analyses.  Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (as per manufactures' instruction) followed by clean-up procedure using Qiagen RNA easy Prep (as per manufactures instructions) In the following study we hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have documented immunomodulatory properties, would reduce sepsis-associated inflammation and organ injury in a clinically relevant model of sepsis.

DESIGN
To identify the molecular changes associated with decreased inflammation in CLP-injured mice treated with MSCs, we analyzed the gene expression profiles from spleens collected at 28 hours from 4 animals per group:  sham/saline, CLP/saline, and CLP/MSCs.
