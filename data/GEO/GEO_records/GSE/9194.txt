TITLE
Comparison of human epididymal gene expression in the caput epididymides of infertile and fertile patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Caput epididymides biopsies from 4 patients suffering from non-obstructive azoospermia and from 4 patients with active spermatogenesis were compared. 414 genes in the caput epididymides were differentially regulated in infertile men by at least a 2-fold change as compared to the fertile men. Keywords: Comparison of infertile and fertile caput epididymides
