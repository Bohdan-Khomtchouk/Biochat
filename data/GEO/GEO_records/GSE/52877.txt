TITLE
FabR ChIP-chip on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
FabR ChIP-chip on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 using anti-Myc antibody against strain with chromosomally 9Myc-tagged FabR (IP samples) and wildtype strain (mock IP samples)

DESIGN
IP sample (using anti-Myc antibody against Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 strain encoding chromosomally 9Myc-tagged FabR) and control mock IP sample (using anti-Myc antibody against Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wildtype strain) were labeled with Cy5 and hybridized against a common genomic DNA reference, labeled with Cy3, on 2 S. Typhimurium LT2 whole genome tiling arrays
