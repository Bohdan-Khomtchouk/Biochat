TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of GRK6 knockout HSCs and CLPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT and GRK6-/- Lin-c-kit+sca-1+ cells (hereafter referred to as HSC) as well as CLP (Lin-c-kit+sca-1+Il-7Ra+) with pooled cDNA library of 13-15 sorted and individually amplified cells from 3-4 mice were sequenced.

DESIGN
pooled cDNA libraries from WT and GRK6-/- HSCs and CLPs were sequenced.

PLATFORM
