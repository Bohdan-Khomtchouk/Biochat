TITLE
COLO829 treatment with PLX4032 and/or MITF knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thousands of enhancers are characterized in the human genome, yet few have been shown important in cancer. Inhibiting oncokinases, such as EGFR, ALK, HER2, and BRAF, is a mainstay of current cancer therapy but is hindered by innate drug resistance mediated by upregulation of the HGF receptor, MET. The mechanisms mediating such genomic responses to targeted therapy are unknown. Here, we identify lineage-specific MET enhancers for multiple common tumor types, including a melanoma lineage-specific MET enhancer that displays inducible chromatin looping and MET gene induction upon BRAF inhibition. Epigenomic analysis demonstrated that the melanocyte-specific transcription factor, MITF, mediates this enhancer function. Targeted genomic deletion ( < 7bp) of the MITF motif within the MET enhancer suppressed inducible chromatin looping and innate drug resistance, while maintaining MITF-dependent, inhibitor-induced melanoma cell differentiation. Epigenomic analysis can thus guide functional disruption of regulatory DNA to decouple pro- and anti-oncogenic functions of tumor lineage-enriched transcription factors mediating innate resistance to oncokinase therapy.

DESIGN
COLO829 human melanoma cell line harboring the BRAFV600E mutation was treated with BRAF inhibtior PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) and/or a hairpin against MITF
