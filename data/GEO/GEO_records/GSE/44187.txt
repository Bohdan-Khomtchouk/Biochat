TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 Scrambled and SIM2si cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 breast cancer cells are a luminal-type breast cancer with moderate native levels of SIM2s.  To determine effects of SIM2s on tumor progression, cells were stably transduced with SIM2si shRNA to knockdown expression, inducing an EMT effect.  Microarray analysis was performed to determine genetic pathways involved in this phenotype. The coordination of cellular metabolism is a key factor in the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).  Pathways regulating the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are unclear.  We have found that transcription factor Singleminded-2s (SIM2s), commonly lost with breast cancer progression, contributes to metabolic regulation by controlling glycolytic flux and cellular senescence.  Through promotion of p21 and cellular senescence, SIM2s decreases glycolytic enzyme activity and promotes oxidative phosphorylation in breast cancer.  These, coupled with increased autophagy and ROS, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. We use microarrays to detail the global gene programming changes that occur with loss of SIM2s gene expression.

DESIGN
Scrambled and SIM2si cells were grown in triplicate for  RNA extraction and hybridization on Amersham microarrays.
