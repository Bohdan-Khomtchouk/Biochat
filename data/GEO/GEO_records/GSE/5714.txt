TITLE
Ssn6HA-ts VS WT @ 36 Deg

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide expression profile study of the transcriptional co-repressor proteins Ssn6 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of a conditional Ssn6HA-ts strain was compared against the expression in a WT strain as described before (Xue et al, 2004), except that cells were shifted to 36 deg 1 h prior to RNA extraction. Keywords: Conditional mutant

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling experiment in which gene expression in logarithmically growing cultures of Ssn6HA-ts mutant was compared to that in wt controls. Wt and Ssn6HA-ts cells were grown in rich medium, and RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA expression profiling analysis using the established protocols (Xue et al, 2004), except that cells were shifted to 36 deg 1 h prior to RNA extraction. Two independent RNA preparations were used to hybridise to two microarrays one on which wildtype was labelled with Cy5 and with Cy3 and the other with dye swap. Data normalized with 'Lowess' per chip per spot normalization.
