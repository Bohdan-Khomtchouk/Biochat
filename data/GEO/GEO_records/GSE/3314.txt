TITLE
Stability of meiosis-specific messenger RNA provides a novel paradigm for the regulation of meiosis

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Compared to mitosis, much remains to be elucidated about molecular regulation of meiosis, although increasing light has been shed recently on its signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and chromosome dynamics. Here we show that some transcripts required exclusively for meiosis in fission yeast, such as mei4 mRNA encoding a transcription factor or rec8 mRNA encoding a cohesin subunit, are highly unstable if expressed during the mitotic cell cycle. These transcripts carry a cis-acting region responsible for the mitotic instability, which we name DSR. A YTH-family protein encoded by the mmi1 gene is essential for manifestation of their instability. Deletion of mmi1 impairs cell growth severely, apparently due to detriments brought by untimely expression of meiotic messages. Microarray analysis using a temperature-sensitive mmi1 mutant has revealed that at least a dozen of meiosis-specific transcripts are governed by the DSR-mmi1 system. Thus, regulation of mRNA stability appears to play a crucial role in differentiating the mitotic and the meiotic cell cycles. Keywords: Keywards: Time course, Temperature-sensitive mutant, mmi1
