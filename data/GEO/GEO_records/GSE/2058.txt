TITLE
Identification of drug associated genes in ovarian cancer by RNA profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two expression profilings were conducted in order to identify drug-associated genes in ovarian cancers. The first expression profiling was performed between RNAs from chemosensitive ovarian cancers and chemoresistant ovarian cancers. The second analysis was using a drug sensitive ovarian cancer cell line and a multi-drug resistant ovarian cancer cell line. Keywords: other
