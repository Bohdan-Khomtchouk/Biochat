TITLE
The prefrontal cortex microRNA expression in mice offspring caused by glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and lactation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, the miRNAs expression pattern in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postnatal day (PND) 28 mice offsprings which were exposured by glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) during pregnancy and lactation was investigated. MiRNA microarray had detected 55 upregulated and 19 downregulated miRNAs in the PND28 mice offsprings' PFC.
