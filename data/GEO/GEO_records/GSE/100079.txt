TITLE
The prefrontal cortex microRNA expression in mice offspring caused by glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and lactation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, the miRNAs expression pattern in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postnatal day (PND) 28 mice offsprings which were exposured by glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) during pregnancy and lactation was investigated. MiRNA microarray had detected 55 upregulated and 19 downregulated miRNAs in the PND28 mice offsprings' PFC.

DESIGN
In this study, the isolated total RNA taken from two pooled samples of two groups, was used to acquire expression profiles, and the result shows 53 differentially-expressed miRNAs, some of them are known to be involved in brain development or the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, indicate that dysregulated expression of miRNAs may be involved in the mechanism of glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity.
