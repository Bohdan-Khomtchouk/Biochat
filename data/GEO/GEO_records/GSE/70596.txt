TITLE
An IL-23R/IL-22 circuit regulates epithelial serum amyloid A to promote local effector Th17 responses [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare mRNAs expressed by Th17 cells and ILC3s in small intestine of lamina propria of mice. Methods: Small intestine were digested with collagenase, dispase, and DNase. Percoll enriched lamina propria Th17 and ILCs sorted by BD ARIA II. Total RNA were harvested and sequencing were performe. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: Small intestine Th17 cells and ILCs exhibit differential gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
