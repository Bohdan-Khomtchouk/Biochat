TITLE
Liver progenitor cell response to human amniotic epithelial cell conditioned media

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the changes in liver progenitor cell (LPC) gene expression in response to human amniotic epithelial cell (hAEC) conditioned media. To find supporting evidence to indicate that hAEC conditioned media promotes proliferation and differentiation of LPC’s. To elucidate which pathways are up or down regulated in LPC’s in order to find potential mechanisms and candidate effector factors produced by hAEC’s.

DESIGN
8 Samples with 3 different medias

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
