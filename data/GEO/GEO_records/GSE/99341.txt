TITLE
Transcriptome data involved in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) albinism

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
In this study, a high-throughput sequencing strategy was employed to identify the mRNA involved in P. olivaceus albinism. Based on P. olivaceus genome, RNA-seq identified 21,787 know genes and 711 new genes by transcripts assembly. Of those, 235 genes exhibited significantly different expression pattern (fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5 and q-value≤0.05), including 194 down-regulated genes and 41 up-regulated genes in albino versus normally pigmented individuals. These genes were enriched to 81 GO terms and 9 KEGG pathways (p≤0.05). Among those, the pigmentation related pathways-Melanogenesis and tyrosine metabolism were contained.

DESIGN
