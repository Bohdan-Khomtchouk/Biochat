TITLE
Comparison of mouse epithelial tumor initiating cells to mesenchymal tumor initiating cells generated by EMT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The differentiation of stem-like cells of tumors may contribute to the cellular heterogeneity of breast cancers. We report the propagation of highly enriched mouse mammary cancer stem cells  that retain the potential to differentiate both in vivo and in culture and their use to identify chemical compounds that influence both self-renewal and differentiation. We identify epithelial tumor initiating cells (ETIC) that expresses lineage markers of both basal and luminal mammary cell lineages and retains the potential to generate heterogeneous tumors similar to the tumor of origin from even single cells. ETIC can progress through a Rho associated coil-coil protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) dependent, epithelial to mesenchymal transition to generate a second cell  type capable of  initiating tumors of limited heterogeneity. The propagation of ETIC will increase the opportunities for identifying new therapeutic compounds that may inhibit or prevent progression of some types of breast cancer. These data compare the gene expression pattern of ETIC and MTIC.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ETIC and MTIC cells, allowing the comparison of gene expression patterns and the selection of potential targets.
