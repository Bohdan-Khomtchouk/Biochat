SUMMARY
Enhanced prenatal fatty streak formation in human fetuses has been associated with maternal hypercholesterolemia. However, the possible roles of maternal genetic background and in utero environment on development of atherosclerosis in adult life have not been unraveled. We generated genetically identical heterozygous apoE-deficient mice offspring with a different maternal background to study the intrauterine effect of maternal genotype and associated hypercholesterolemia on the developing vascular system. As read out for increased atherosclerosis development in adult life, a constrictive collar was placed around the carotid artery to induce lesion formation. A significant increase in endothelial cell activation and damage was detected in the carotid arteries of heterozygous apoE-deficient fetuses with apoE-deficient mothers compared with offspring from wild type mothers, but no fatty streak formation was observed. Postnatally, all carotid arteries revealed normal morphology. In adult offspring with maternal apoE-deficiency, the constrictive collar resulted in severe lesion (9/10) development compared with no to only minor lesions (2/10) in offspring of wild type mothers. Microarray analysis showed no effect of maternal apoE-deficiency on gene expression in adult offspring. We conclude that maternal apoE-deficiency not only affects fetal arteries, but also increases the susceptibility for development of collar-induced atherosclerosis in adult life.
