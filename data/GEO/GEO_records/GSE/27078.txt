TITLE
LID ChIP-Seq in wild type, and H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq in wild type and lid RNAi Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
LID is a histone demethylase acting on H3K4me3, a mark related to transcription and found near the transcription start sites (TSS) of the genes. We analyzed where LID is localized and the effects of LID downregulation in the distribution of H3K4me3.

DESIGN
Analysis of LID-binding sites in wild type, and of H3K4me3-binding sites in wild type and LID RNAi wing imaginal discs.

PLATFORM
GPL9061 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Drosophila melanogaster)
