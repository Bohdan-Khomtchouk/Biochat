SUMMARY
MiRNAs are key regulators of gene expression. They are processed from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), most of which are transcribed by DNA-dependent polymerase II (Pol II). MiRNA levels need to be precisely controlled to maintain various biological processes. In this manuscript, we report a discovery that STV1, a conserved ribosomal protein, acts in miRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis. A portion of STV1 localizes at the nucleus and binds pri-miRNAs. Using pri-miR172b as a reporter, we show that STV1 binds the stem-loop with a short 5â€™ flanking sequencing within pri-miRNAs. Lack of STV1 in stv1-1 reduced the association of pri-miRNAs with their processing complex. These data suggest that STV1 promotes miRNA biogenesis through facilitating the recruitment of pri-miRNAs to their processing complex. Furthermore, we show that STV1 indirectly influence the occupancy of Pol II at the promoters of miRNA coding genes (MIR) and MIR promoter activities.  Based on these results, we propose that STV1 refines the accumulation of miRNAs through its combined effects on pri-miRNA processing and transcription. This study uncovers an extra-ribsomal function of STV1.
