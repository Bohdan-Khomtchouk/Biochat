TITLE
Expression data from chicken B cell lymphoma (DT40) cell lines.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profiling of the avian B-lymphoma DT40 cell line was used as a model to differentiate among Btk KO and Btk KO cells reconstituted with human Btk. Differences in the gene expression pattern showed statistically significant changes between parental DT40 and all the Btk KO cell populations irrespective of whether they are reconstituted or not. These results imply that in the process of generating a knockout cell line, subclones are selected, which have multiple changes in their gene expression pattern (p < 0.01). Keywords: cell line
