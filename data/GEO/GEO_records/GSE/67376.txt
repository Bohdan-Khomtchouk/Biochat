TITLE
Transcriptional analyses of mandarins seriously infected by “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus”

ORGANISM
Citrus reticulata

SUMMARY
HLB is suggested to be caused by the phloem-limited fastidious prokaryotic α-proteobacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter spp.” Previous studies focused on the proteome and transcriptome analyses of citrus 5 to 35-week-after “Ca. L. spp.” inoculation. In this study, gene expression profiles was analyzed using mandarin of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. jiaogan leaves after 2-year infection with “Ca. L. asiaticus”.

DESIGN
The Affymetrix GeneChip® citrus genome were applied to study the molecular pathways mediated by “Ca. L. asiaticus” inoculated 3-year-old jiaogan seedlings. Each of them was graft-inoculated with one sweet orange scions with or without “Ca. L. asiaticus” in Dectember, 2009. RNA samples from three mandarin trees infected with 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' and three uninfected trees were used for affymatrix genochip
