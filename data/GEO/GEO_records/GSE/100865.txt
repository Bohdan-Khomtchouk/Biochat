TITLE
Differential ability of pandemic and seasonal H1N1 influenza 1 A virus to alter function of human neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neutrophils are essential cells of host innate immunity. Although the role of neutrophils in defense against bacterial and fungal infections is well characterized, there is relative paucity of information about their role against viral infections. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can be associated with secondary bacterial co-infection, and it has long been posited that the ability of IAV to alter normal neutrophil function predisposes individuals to secondary bacterial infections. To better understand this phenomenon, we evaluated the interaction of pandemic or seasonal H1N1 IAV with human neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects. These viruses were ingested by human neutrophils and elicited changes in neutrophil gene expression that are consistent with an interferon-mediated immune response. Viability of neutrophils following co-culture with either pandemic and seasonal H1N1 IAV was similar for up to 18 h of culture. Notably, neutrophil exposure to seasonal IAV (but not pandemic IAV) primed these leukocytes for enhanced functions, including production of reactive oxygen species and bactericidal activity. Taken together, our results are at variance with the universal idea that IAV impairs neutrophil function directly to predispose individuals to secondary bacterial infections. Rather, we suggest some strains of IAV prime neutrophils for enhanced bacterial clearance.
