TITLE
Low-cost, low-bias and low-input RNA-seq with High Experimental Verifiability based on Semiconductor Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a new method on sequencing low-input RNA. This method shows much low-bias with the advantage of semiconductor while competing with smart-seq2. In order to analyze the low-input RNA datasets sensitively, we also develop FANSe2splice with high experimental verification rate as the analysis tool in our method.

DESIGN
The RNA of HBE and A549 were sequenced in our method. And smart-seq2 was also examined in HBE RNA.
