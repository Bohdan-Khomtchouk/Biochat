TITLE
Gene expression signatures for Nanog-positive and Nanog-negative hepatocellular carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray expression profiling of  HCC cell line (Huh7) and patients derive primary HCC cells (T1115 and T1224) expressing Nanog or not. Results provide insight into the role of Nanog in transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Using Nanog promoter as a reporter system, we sorted the Nanog-positive and Nanog-negative cells from Huh7, T1115 and T1224 by FACS, respectively. Each group is composed of a Nanog negative control and two independent Nanog positive samples.
