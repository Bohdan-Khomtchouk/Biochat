TITLE
Gene expression analysis of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide gene expression profiling of lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumor adjacent tissues. The Agilent microarray was used to obtain gene expression profiles. Samples included eight lung cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues excised from a cohort of 8 patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocol. The purity and concentration of RNA was determined by Nano Drop ND-1000 spectrophotometer according to OD260/280 reading. Each time point has three replicates. Total RNAs were hybridized using mRNA + lncRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray
