TITLE
Gene expression in Drosophila female heads during diapause.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Young Drosophila females respond to low temperature and short photoperiod by developmental arrest of the ovaries.  This form of reproductive diapause is a winter adaptation. Here we used Affymetrix microarrays to study global expression in female heads associated with diapause.

DESIGN
Within 8 hr after eclosion, flies were transferred to vials and maintained in light boxes illuminated by a 4W fluorescent bulb at 12.5Â°C under light-dark cycle (LD) 14:10. After 12 days, flies were dissected and ovaries status (diapause vs. non-diapause) was determined.
