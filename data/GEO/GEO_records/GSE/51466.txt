TITLE
Polarization profiling of renal macrophages in stone model mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently reported elimination of renal crystals and migration of macrophages (Mφ) around crystals in hyperoxaluric mice, suggesting Mφs might eliminate crystals. Mφs are of 2 phenotypes: inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2). Because M2Mφs are considered to be involved in tissue repair and regeneration, we focused attention on their suppressive role in renal crystal formation. Hence, we investigated the gene array profiling of renal macrophages in stone model mice and CSF-1-deficient stone model mice.

DESIGN
B6C3Fe a/a-Csf1op/J wild type/homozygous mice were admistered 80mg/kg gyyoxylate (GOX) for 6days, then the kidneys were extracted and sorted CD11b+/CD11c+ macrophages using autoMACS. The gene expression of WT- and op/op-macrophages were investigated using bone marrow derived M1/M2 macrophages as controls.
