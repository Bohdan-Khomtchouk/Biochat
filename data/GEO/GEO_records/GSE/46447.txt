TITLE
Expression data from miR-205 knockout in Hair Follicle Stem Cells (HFSCs) of mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified 201 genes that are consistently upregulated more than 20%, and 108 genes that are consistently downregulated more than 20% in the miR-205 KO samples in two sets of biological duplicates. We used microarrays to measure transcriptome changes upon knockout of miR-205 in hair follicle stem cells of mouse skin and identified new targets of miR-205.

DESIGN
We isolated the HFSCs from WT and miR-205 KO skin at P4 and compare mRNA expression by microarray analysis
