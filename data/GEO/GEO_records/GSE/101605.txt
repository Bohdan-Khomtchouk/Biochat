TITLE
RNA-sequencing of mouse E14.5 embryonic neural stem cells transduced in vitro with a shRNA against Foxp1 or a scrambled shRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through RNA-sequencing we analysed the differentially expressed genes upon in vitro knockdown of Foxp1 in mouse E14.5 embryonic neural stem cells using one shRNA against Foxp1

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of mouse E14.5 embryonic neural stem cells transduced with lentivirus carrying 1 shRNA scrambled or 1 shRNA  against Foxp1 in biological duplicate (different passages)

PLATFORM
GPL16790 AB 5500 Genetic Analyzer (Mus musculus)
