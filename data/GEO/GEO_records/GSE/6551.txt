TITLE
Expression data from intracranial arteries and intracranial aneurysms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression information is useful in prioritizing candidate genes in linkage intervals. The data can also identify pathways involved in the pathophysiology of disease. We used microarrays to identify which genes are expressed in either intracranial arteries (control) or in intracranial aneurysms (case), and can therefore contribute to the disease phenotypes. We used microarrays to identify the pathway membership of expressed genes and the overrepresentation of pathways with expressed genes in the known linkage intervals for intracranial aneurysms. Keywords: Characterization of expression in both diseased and non-diseased intracranial arteries.
