TITLE
Exon array data for patient-matched primary and metastatic colorectal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from surgically resected tumor specimens/metastases from patients with colorectal cancer. The expression profiles were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array version 2.

DESIGN
The RMA procedure was used for normalization. We then performed further quantile normalization to the sample data from the CMSpredictor R package, and then used this classifyCMS predictor to assign CMS classes for these samples. A class was assigned if both the RF nearest and SSP nearest predictions were the same.
