TITLE
Listeria monocytogenes Grown at Refrigeration Temperature Shows Reduced Acid Survival and an Altered Transcriptional Response to Acid Shock

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Survival of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in acidic environments (e.g., stomach and low pH foods) is vital to its transmission. L. monocytogenes grows at temperatures as low as 2°C, and refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods have been sources of L. monocytogenes outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to determine whether growth at a low temperature (i.e., 7°C) affects the response of L. monocytogenes to sudden acid shock.
