TITLE
Expression analysis of fully-grown oocyte collected from mouse wild-type, Hsf1 mutant or Hsf2 mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in oocytes Hsf1-/- or Hsf2-/- compared to wild-type. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in McMillan DR, Xiao X, Shao L, Graves K, Benjamin IJ. 1998. Targeted disruption of heat shock transcription factor 1 abolishes thermotolerance and protection against heat-inducible apoptosis. J Biol Chem. 273(13):7523-8 and in McMillan DR, Christians E, Forster M, Xiao X, Connell P, Plumier JC, Zuo X, Richardson J, Morgan S, Benjamin IJ. 2002. Heat shock transcription factor 2 is not essential for embryonic development, fertility, or adult cognitive and psychomotor function in mice. Mol Cell Biol. 22(22):8005-14.

DESIGN
A microarray study using two technical replicates of total RNA recovered from wild-type fully-grown oocytes, Hsf1 mutant fully-grown oocytes and Hsf2 mutant fully-grown oocytes. Each microarray measures the expression level of 42,586 probe sets from Mus musculus with nine 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
