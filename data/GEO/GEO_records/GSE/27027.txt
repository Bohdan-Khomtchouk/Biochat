TITLE
Expression profiling of mammary stem cell enriched fractions and other fractions from fetal and adult mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of genome-wide, gene expression level differences among adult and fetal mammary sub-populations including fetal CD24high cells and adult CD49fhighCD24medium cells which harbor enriched mammary stem cell activity.

DESIGN
A genome wide 12-plex expression array using linear-amplified (Eberwine) mRNA from dissociated and FACS sorted  fetal and adult mammary gland populations. Samples represent independent pooled biological replicates.
