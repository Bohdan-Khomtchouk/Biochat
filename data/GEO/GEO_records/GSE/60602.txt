TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes when KLF6 is overexpressed in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KLF6 was overexpressed using an adenoviral delivery system. Overexpression was confirmed at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection by RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis. Codelink Whole genome microarrays were used to analyse changes in expression resulting from KLF6 overexpression.

DESIGN
RNA Samples were taken at 48 and 72 hours from samples oeverexpressing KLF6 and the empty vector control pBabe
