TITLE
Effect of IL-12 on CTL gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to determine how IL-12 affects gene expression by murine CTL.

DESIGN
Following RBC lysis, splenocytes from OT-1 TCR transgenic mice (5 million/ml) were cultured in six well-plates (5-6ml/well) in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS and 55μM 2-ME with 1μM SIINFEKL.  After 4 days, the cells were harvested by purification with Ficoll-Paque PLUS and placed in fresh medium containing 0 or 20ng/ml rmIL-12.  Twenty-four hours later the cells were harvested and used in experiments.  The live cells harvested were > 98% CD8+Vα2+ (OT-1).
