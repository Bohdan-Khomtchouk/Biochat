TITLE
Expression data from complex genetic sarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For this study, we selected, from the French Sarcoma Group (FSG) database, soft tissue sarcomas with no recurrent chromosomal translocations and for which frozen tissue of the untreated primary tumor was available. One hundred and eighty-three cases were studied. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying the tumor biology.

DESIGN
Every case was histologically reviewed by pathologists and classified according to the 2002 WHO classification using histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic and cytogenetic when needed.
