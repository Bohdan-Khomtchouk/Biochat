TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of virulence factors in Vibrio parahaemolyticus FORC_022, isolated from a soy sauce marinated crab

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus

SUMMARY
Crab is one of the major source for V. parahaemolyticus outbreak among aquatic products in Northeast Asian due to improperly cooking and wound infection by mishandling. However, there is no report on whole genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from contaminated crab, thus no information is available for major virulence factors about V. parahaemolyticus obtained from crab. Therefore, the analysis of transcriptome of isolated V. parahaemolyticus from crab products are necessary to investigate potential risk of foodborne illness by contaminated products.

DESIGN
The washed swimming crab added to FORC_022 inoculated minimal medium, and incubated for 4 h/Control group  (FORC_022 inoculated minimal medium, and incubated for 4 h), in biological duplication, using Illumina HiSeq2500.
