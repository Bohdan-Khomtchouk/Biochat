TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-34b/c and DAC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found frequent epigenetic silencing of microRNA-34b/c in human colorectal cancer. Introduction of miR-34b/c into a colorectal cancer cell line induced significant changes in gene expression profile. We also found overlap between the genes downregulated by miR-34b/c and those downregulated by DAC. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
A colorecal cancer cell line HCT116 was transfected with miR-34b or -c precursor or negative control. Also, HCT116 was treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) or mock. Genes up- or downregulated by miR-34b/c and those by DAC was compared.
