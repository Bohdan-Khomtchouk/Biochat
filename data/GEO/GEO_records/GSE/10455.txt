TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-34b/c and DAC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found frequent epigenetic silencing of microRNA-34b/c in human colorectal cancer. Introduction of miR-34b/c into a colorectal cancer cell line induced significant changes in gene expression profile. We also found overlap between the genes downregulated by miR-34b/c and those downregulated by DAC. Keywords: dose response
