TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under strong artificial selection

ORGANISM
Arachis hypogaea

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles of widespread peanut cultivars  for exploring the expression data in pod and leaf  with regard to signatures of artificial selection

DESIGN
We investigated the overall expression by hybridizing the microarray (GPL13178) with RNA samples from pods and leaves of five selected representative peanut varieties (Fuhuasheng, Shitouqi, Yueyou116, Shanyou523, and Yueyou7), which were widely cultivated in different periods of the past fifty years in southern China. We used the RNA sample from Yueyou7 pod as a reference for all the pod hybridizations, and used the Yueyou7 leaf sample as a reference for all the leaf hybridizations. Field grown plants under normal irrigation were used for sample collection. Replicates with dye-swap were performed for each genotype.
