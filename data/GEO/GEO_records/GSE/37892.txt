SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Histological staging is efficient but combination with molecular markers may improve tumors classification. Gene expression profiles have been defined as prognosis predictors among stage II and III tumors but their implementation in medical practice remains controversial. Stage-II tumors have been recognized as a heterogeneous group and high-risk morphologic features have been retained as justifying adjuvant chemotherapy. We propose here the investigation of clinical features and expression profiles from stage II and stage III colon carcinomas without DNA mismatch repair defect. A series of 130 colon cancer samples was retained. Expression profiles were established on oligonucleotide microarrays and processed in the R/Bioconductor environment. Hierarchical then supervised analyses were successively performed applying the data-sampling approach. A molecular signature of seven genes was found to cluster stage III tumors with an adjusted p-values lower than 10^-10. A subgroup of stage-II tumors aggregated this cluster in both series. No correlation was found between with the disease severity but the function of the discriminating genes suggests that tumors have been classified according to their putative response to adjuvant targeted or classic therapies. Further pharmacogenetic studies might document this observation.

DESIGN
Expression profile of stage-II colon carcinomas distinguishes two patterns of tumors based on a 7-gene signature. One pattern is very similar to that of stage-III tumors and the corresponding tumors aggregate into a single cluster. Genes function suggests possible tumor determinism in drug response more than in prognosis evolution.
