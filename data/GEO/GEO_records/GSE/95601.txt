TITLE
Olfactory stem cell differentiation: horizontal basal cell (HBC) lineage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lineage of the horizontal basal cells (HBC) stem cells and other Sox2eGFP-positive cells from the olfactory epithelium were profiled by single-cell RNA-Seq to identify differentiated cells types, intermediate stages, transition states, and to infer the lineage trajectories.

DESIGN
Horizontal basal cell (HBC) stem cells from the olfactory epithelium that were either wild-type or mutant for the transcription factor Trp63/p63 were lineage traced, collected by FACS, and profiled by single-cell RNA-seq.  Additionally, Sox2eGFP transgenic cells from the olfactory epithelium were combined with this data into one data set that was processed together. A minimum of two biological replicates were collected for each time-point/experimental condition. A total of 680 YFP-positive lineage traced cells plus 169 Sox2eGFP-positive cells were used in this analysis.
