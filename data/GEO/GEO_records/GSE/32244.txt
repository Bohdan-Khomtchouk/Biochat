TITLE
Foxa1 and Foxa2 are Required for Sexual Dimorphism in Liver Cancer - Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes between livers of treated WT and dKO (Foxa1 and Foxa2 KO) male and female mice and untreated female (WT and dKO) mice were measured to identify pathways related to Foxa1/2 regulation of pathways involved in liver cancer.

DESIGN
The experiment uses 4 replicates each for 6 conditions
