TITLE
Trancriptomic profiling of hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells of rats treated with nongenotoxic carcinogens for up to 2 weeks

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Conventional notion regards the action of non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGC) an autonomous process largely confined to parenchymal cells. Here we aim to elucidate the role of the hepatic mesenchyme for the action of two prototypical NGC, phenobarbital (PB), an anti-epileptic drug, and cyproterone acetate (CPA) a gestagen used in contraceptive pills.

DESIGN
8 weeks old male and female Wistar rats received either 50 mg/kg/day Phenobarbital (PB) or 100 mg/kg/day Cyproterone acetate (CPA) for up to 14 days. We profiled mRNA expression in hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells to assess the different effects of PB and CPA on different liver tissues. Time-matched control animals received vehicle (Corn oil for CPA or Water for PB).
