TITLE
Serial gene expression profiling in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg mice that developed hepatic fibrosis and tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over expression of PDGF-C in mouse liver resulted in the progression of hepatic fibrosis, steatosis and the development of HCC; this mouse model closely resembles the human HCC that is frequently associated with hepatic fibrosis. Peretinoin (generic name; code, NIK-333), developed by the Kowa Company, (Tokyo, Japan), is an oral acyclic retinoid (ACR) with a vitamin A-like structure that targets the retinoid nuclear receptor. Peretinoin effectively inhibits the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors in Pdgf-c Tg mice. Gene expression profiling was evaluated during the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors.

DESIGN
After weaning at week 4, Pdgf-c Tg or non-transgenic WT mice were fed a basal diet or a diet containing+0.06% peretinoin respectively. At week 20, mice were sacrificed for the analysis of progression of hepatic fibrosis. At week 48, mice were sacrificed for the analysis of the development of hepatic tumors.
