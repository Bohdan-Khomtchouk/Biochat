TITLE
Neutrophil transcript abundance following 3/6 hr culture in normoxia, hypoxia and anoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neutrophils are key effector cells of the innate immune response and are required to migrate and function within highly adverse micro-environmental conditions.  These inflammatory sites are characterised by low levels of oxygen.  We examined the relative transcript abundance detected in an apoptosis targeted gene array following invitro neutrophil culture (3/6 hrs)  in normoxic, hypoxic and anoxic conditions. Keywords: repeat sample
