TITLE
Consequences of exchanging carbohydrates for proteins in the cholesterol metabolism of mice fed a high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dietary proteins have profound effects on lipid metabolism but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the temporal impact of dietary proteins in isoenergetic high fat diets on lipid metabolism of C57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
Mice were first fed a low protein (P) to carbohydrate (C) ratio high-fat diet (L-P/C-HF) for 10 weeks and then a half of mice were changed to a high protein to carbohydrate ratio high-fat diet (H-P/C-HF) for additional 4 weeks whereas the remaining mice continued eating the L-P/C-HF diet.
