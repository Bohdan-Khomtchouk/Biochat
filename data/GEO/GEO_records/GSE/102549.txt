TITLE
Genome-wide identification of Grainy head targets in Drosophila [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Grainy head (Grh) is a conserved transcription factor (TF) controlling epithelial differentiation and regeneration. To elucidate Grh functions, we identified embryonic Grh targets by ChIP-seq and gene expression analysis. We show that Grh controls hundreds of target genes. Repression or activation correlates with the distance of Grh binding sites to the transcription start sites of its targets. Analysis of 54 Grh-responsive enhancers during development and upon wounding suggests cooperation with distinct TFs in different contexts. In the airways, Grh repressed genes encode key TFs involved in branching and cell differentiation. Reduction of the POU-domain TF, Vvl, (ventral veins lacking) largely ameliorates the airway morphogenesis defects of grh mutants. Vvl and Grh proteins additionally interact with each other and regulate a set of common enhancers during epithelial morphogenesis. We conclude that Grh and Vvl participate in a regulatory network controlling epithelial maturation.

DESIGN
To investige the effect of the Grainy head (Grh) transcription factor, Drosophila embryos with the following genotypes were subjected to microarray analysis: wild type, grh mutant and grh overexpression. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and the mutant and overexpression strains were compared to the wild type.
