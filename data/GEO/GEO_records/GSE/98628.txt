TITLE
Cdk10KO mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of Cdk10 in the developing mouse embryo, we isolated eight tissues [heart, brain, liver, stomach, thymus, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine] on the day the pups were born [P0]. Each tissue was immediately processed for mRNA isolation.

DESIGN
Tissues from P0 mouse tissues were analyzed for changes in gene expression
