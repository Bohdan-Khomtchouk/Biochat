TITLE
Small RNA analysis of ASR5 knockdown rice plants (ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) under Al stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Aluminum (Al) toxicity in plants is one of the primary constraints in crop production. Al³⁺, the most toxic form of Al, is released into soil under acidic conditions and causes extensive damage to plants, especially in the roots. In rice, Al tolerance requires the ASR5 gene, but the molecular function of ASR5 has remained unknown. This data establish a comparative study of miRNAome profiles in ASR5 knockdown rice plants (ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) under Al stress conditions.

DESIGN
microRNA profiles in 4 different shoot libraries of Oryza sativa  (ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare)  by deep sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2000).

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
