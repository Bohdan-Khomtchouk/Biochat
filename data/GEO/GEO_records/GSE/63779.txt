TITLE
The maize genome encodes novel members of the purple acid phosphatase (PAP) subgroup Ia

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
In this study we perform a transcriptomics analysis of two maize (Zea mays) organs, roots and leaves, from plants grown in the presence of a sufficient (1000 uM) or limiting (10 uM) concentration of soil phosphate.

DESIGN
Duplicate root and leaf mRNA profiles for plants grown in the presence of 1000 uM or 10 uM soil phosphate.
