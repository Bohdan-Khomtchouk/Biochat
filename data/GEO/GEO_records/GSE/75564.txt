TITLE
LKB1 and Notch deletion in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterize the phenotype of mice in which the deletion of Lkb1 has been targeted in the liver. Lack of Lkb1 in the liver results in bile duct paucity leading to cholestasis. This phenotype is similar to that obtained upon inactivation of Notch signaling in the liver. We test the hypothesis of a functional overlap between the Lkb1 and Notch pathways by gene expression profiling of livers deficent in Lkb1 or in the Notch mediator RbpJκ. We used AlfpCre mice for liver-specific deletion of LKB1 that were crossed with a conditional knockout mouse model (LKB1 floxed mice). We used also AlfpCre mice for liver-specific inactivation of the Notch pathway. AlfpCre mice were crossed with the RbpJκ floxed mice. RNA was extracted from the liver of LKB1 KO mice (Lkb1Floxed, AlfpCre positive mice) and their wild-type counterpart (Lkb1Floxed, AlfpCre negative mice). RNA was also extracted from liver of RbpJK KO mice (RbpJK floxed, AlfpCre positive) and their wild type mice (RbpJK floxed, AlfpCe negative).

DESIGN
6 samples for the liver-specific deletion of LKB1 corresponding to 3 KO LKB1 (Cre positive) and 3 normal liver (Cre negative). 6 samples for the liver-specific inactivation of the Notch pathway corresponding to 3 KO RbpJk (Cre positive) and 3 normal liver (Cre negative).
