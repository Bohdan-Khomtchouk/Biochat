TITLE
Dramatic effects of social behavior on gene regulation in rhesus macaques [Bisulfite seq]

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
These data are a component of a larger study investigating differences in gene regulation in relationship to rhesus macaque dominance rank. These data compare DNA methylation levels between individuals of different rank on a genome-wide scale using bisulfite sequencing

DESIGN
DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampled from 3 high ranking individuals and 3 low ranking individuals (all adult female rhesus macaques)

PLATFORM
GPL14954 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Macaca mulatta)
