TITLE
MicroRNA and gene expression changes in human cerebral aneurysms [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cerebral Aneurysm tissues and superficial temporal arteries were compared through RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes, and through microRNA microarray to identify differentially expressed microRNAs. Significant miR:gene pairs were identified for potential microRNA silencing regualtory effects.

DESIGN
To study differentially expressed genes and microRNAs in cerebral aneurysms, we collected 7 cerebral aneurysm tisses and 10 superficial temporal artery (STA) tisses from 17 individuals. We performed RNA-Seq and microRNA microarray analysis on these samples, and compared them using STA as a control.
