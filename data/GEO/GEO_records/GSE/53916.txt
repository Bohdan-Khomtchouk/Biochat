TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow cells expressing renin driven expression of green fluorescent protein.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Local renin antiotensin systems have been identified for many extra-renal sites. Bone marrow has been proposed as one such site, although the nature of the renin-expressing cell type(s) has not been established. Affymetrix microarrays were used to characterize the expression profile of renin-expressing GFP positive cells.

DESIGN
Green fluorescent protein positive cells were sorted from whole bone marrow collected from adult transgenic mice. Bone marrow from several mice was collected and pooled on the day of a FACS sort. A portion of this was reserved for RNA extraction while the remainder was sorted. RNA was prepared with Trizol. Bone marrow collection and sorting was performed 3 times so that microarrays could be run in triplicate.
