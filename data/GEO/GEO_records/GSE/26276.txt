TITLE
Evaluation of differential gene expression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profiles of ALS patients with normal patients and with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) patients.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle specimens from 3 ALS patients, 3 MMN patients, and 3 control patients were used to find disease markers specifically expressed in ASL and MMN patients.
