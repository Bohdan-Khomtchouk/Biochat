TITLE
Differential gene expression m39 vs. siblings

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of cloche m39 mutant zebrafish embryos and wild type siblings at 90% epiboly - tailbud stage

DESIGN
In order  to isolate the cloche gene, RNAseq was performed on a deletion allele of the zebrafish cloche mutant.  RNA was extracted from individual embryos at a stage the cloche gene was predicted to be expressed based on previous literature. RNA from the respective genoptypes was then pooled and subjected to RNAseq analysis.
