TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of long nonpolyadenylated RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used deep sequencing to explore the repertoire of both poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNAs from two standard cell lines, HeLa cells and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) H9 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of nonpolyadenylated and polyadenylated RNA in 2 cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
