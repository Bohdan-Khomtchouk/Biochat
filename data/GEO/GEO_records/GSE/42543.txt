TITLE
Loss of imprinting at the CTCF binding sites in the DLK1-DIO3 domain reactivates microRNA expression in acute promyelocytic leukaemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the DNA-methylation profiling of 10 regions selected from the DLK1-DIO3 domain on chromosome 14q32 in BM/PB samples from patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), other subclasses of acute myeloid leukaemia and healthy donors, using high-throughput amplicon bisulfite sequencing with Roche 454 technology. We identify monoallelic-hypermethylation in APL only at the differentially methylated region (DMR) located upstream from the MEG3 gene (MEG3-DMR), whereas no changes in the DNA methylation profile were detected at the imprinting control region of the domain (IG-DMR) among the samples analysed. We show that the expression profile of 6 miRNAs clustered downstream from the MEG3-DMR correlates with the methylation profile at both DMRs. We demonstrate that miRNAs expression negatively correlates with DNA-methylation at the IG-DMR and MEG3 gene-body, whereas the correlation was positive for the CpGs located in the promoter of MEG3, including the binding sites for the insulator CTCF. We propose a loss of imprinting at the CTCF binding sites in patients with APL. These results are consistent with the previously reported DLK1-DIO3 miRNAs overexpression in APL, indicating a possible involvement of these ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of the disease.
