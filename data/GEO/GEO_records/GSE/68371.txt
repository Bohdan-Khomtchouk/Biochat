TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mouse lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) from the subcapsular sinus (SS, afferent) and lymphatic sinus (LS, efferent)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Afferent lymphatic vessels bring antigens and diverse populations of leukocytes to draining lymph nodes, but efferent lymphatics allow only lymphocytes to leave the nodes. Despite fundamental importance of afferent vs. efferent lymphatics in immune response and cancer spread, molecular characteristics of these different arms of the lymphatic vasculature are largely unknown. In this work we report marked transcriptional differences between afferent and efferent lymphatic endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Mouse inguinal, axillary, and brachial lymphnodes were collected and cryomolds prepared for laser-capture microdissection.  Frozen sections were stained with various cell marker antibodies and micro-dissection performed to collect lymphatic endothelial cells. Total RNA was extracted from the cells and used in microarray analysis. Alternatively, popliteal, caudal, lumbar, inguinal, mesenteric, renal, axillary, brachial, deep and superficial cervical LN were enzymatically digested, the cells stained, and FACs sorted before RNA isolation.
