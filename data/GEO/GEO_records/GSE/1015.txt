SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to profile liver gene expression in the liver of bovine fetuses throughout pregnancy. Thus, liver total RNA was obtained from fetuses in early (days 54 & 65), mid (days 135 & 150) and late (day 245) pregnancy. These test RNAs were individually hybridized with a control RNA obtained from nonpregnant cycling adult cows. So that the expression profiles given elsewhere represent liver gene expression in the fetsues compared to that in the liver of adult nonpregnant cows. Keywords = differential liver gene expression Keywords = bovine fetus Keywords = hierarchical clustering Keywords: time-course
