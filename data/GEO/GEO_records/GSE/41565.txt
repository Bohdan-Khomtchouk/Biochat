TITLE
Modeling Human Cortical Development in vitro using induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human iPSCs grown in suspension in the presence of rostral neuralizing factors generated three-dimensional structures containing polarized radial glia, intermediate progenitors and a spectrum of layer-specific cortical neurons reminiscent of their organization in vivo. The hiPSC-derived multilayered structures express a gene expression profile typical of the embryonic telencephalon, but not that of other CNS regions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from iPSC lines and H1 line was submitted for microarray analysis using HumanHT-12 v4 BEADCHIP (Illumina).
