TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in response to impaired mitochondrial translation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to establish the global gene expression profiles of seedlings under doxycycline treatment or genetic silencing of MRPL1 (AT2G42710).

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed using Arabidopsis wild type (Col-0) and mrpl1-1  mutant seedlings under normal condition, as well as wild type seedlings exposed to doxycycline (Dox). Three biological replicates were conducted for each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL20696 Ion Torrent Proton (Arabidopsis thaliana)
