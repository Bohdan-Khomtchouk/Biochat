TITLE
Expression data during plantaris muscle hypertrophy induced by synergist ablation in young adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns were determined from microarray results on day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 during plantaris muscle hypertrophy induced by synergist ablation in young adult mice (5 months).

DESIGN
For each time point, two Affymetrix chips (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST) were used with 100 ng of total RNA derived from a pooled sample of either the right or left plantaris muscles from six animals.
