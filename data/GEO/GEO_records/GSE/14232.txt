TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of freshly sorted and expanded regulatory and conventional T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of freshly sorted regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+) and conventional T cells (CD4+CD25-) and of expansion cultures of regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+CD45RA+) and conventional T cells (CD4+CD25-).

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were performed of freshly sorted Treg and Tconv cells each. Four replicates of Treg expansion cultures sorted into CD45RA+/- subpopulations prior to RNA extraction were performed.
