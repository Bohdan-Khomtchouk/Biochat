TITLE
Signature of human hepatocytes treated with Aroclor1254

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine molecular rules for transcriptional regulation of targeted genes to explain in part the pleiotropic effect observed in animals and humans upon exposure to Aroclor 1254 we treated human hepatocytes with Aroclor1254 and analysed RNA expression using a Nimblegene human custom array. Keywords: Human hepatocytes, Aroclor1254 treatment, 20µM, 72h

DESIGN
Human hepatocytes isolated from surgical material were treated with 20µM Aroclor1254 for 72h. Non-treated cells served as control. Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN´s RNeasy total RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Oligonucleotide microarrays were hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
