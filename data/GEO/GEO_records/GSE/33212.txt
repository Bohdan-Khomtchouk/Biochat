TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of MDS42 and MG1655

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
A genome reduced E. coli strain MDS42 and its parent strain MG1655 were applied for the comparative transcriptome analysis. Genome-wide transcriptional changes due to genome reduction and heat shock were comprehensively evaluated.

DESIGN
The target strains exponetially grown in the minimal media were collected for the transcriptome analysis. Every 7 and 3 biological replications for the steady growth and  heat shock conditions were performed, respectively. Cell growth was strictly controlled.
