TITLE
Dynamic time course miRNA profiling of human skeletal muscle cell differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine the miRNA expression profile of in vitro differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells and to couple changes in individual miRNA expression to transcriptional output of target genes. miRNA expression profiling at six different time points during the in vitro differentiation process of human skeletal muscle cells from six subjects. RNA was harvested from myoblasts before induction of differentiation and at every other day for 10 following days.

DESIGN
Temporal, time-course design with paired analysis (6 subjects). Biological replicates: 6 at day 0, 6 at day 2, 6 at day 4, 6 at day 6, 6 at day 8, and 5 at day 10. One replicate vs common reference RNA pool per array.
