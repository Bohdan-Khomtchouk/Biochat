TITLE
Expression profiling of prostate cancer biopsies.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This work was conducted to identify shared and specific target genes of different ETS transcription factor rearrangements in prostate cancer. Potential target genes were identified by differential gene expression analysis of primary tumor samples with ETS rearrangements, and validated by ETS silencing in prostate cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
The series consists of 50 primary tumor samples from a consecutive series of 200 clinically localized cancers treated with radical prostatectomy at the Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal. The series is enriched in tumors with ETS transcription factor rearrangments.
