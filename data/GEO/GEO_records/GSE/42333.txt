TITLE
Effect of cigarette smoke extract, cisplatin, nicotine and/or ionizing radiation on microRNA expression in the NCI-H460 human lung large cell carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Human alphaherpesvirus 1

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of nicotine on sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation or anti-cancer drugs, NCI-H460 human lung large cell carcinoma cells were treated with 6 Gy ionizing radiation or 1 uM cisplatin after exposure to 0.5 uM nicotine or cigarette smoke extract. MicroRNA expression in total RNA extracted from the treated cells was quantified using the 7th generation miRCURY™ locked nucleic acid microarray platform from Exiqon® (Vedbaek, Denmark).
