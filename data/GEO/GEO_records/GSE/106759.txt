TITLE
Context-dependent effects of Acf1 assessed in high throughput

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We applied a multiplexed genomic tethering assay (Brueckner, Epigenetics Chromatin, 2016; PMID:27777628) to elucidate the function of ACF1, the large subunit of the ACF nucleosome sliding complex in drosophila Kc167 cells. Targeting a Gal4DBD-ACF1 fusion to several hundred integrated reporters revealed a context-dependent repressive effect which is modulated by gene activity and chromatin state.

DESIGN
TRIP assay in drosophila Kc167 cells combined with targeted recruitment of Gal4-Acf1 to integrated 5xGa4UAS-pMT-GFP reporters. Two technical replicate experiments of TRIP pool transfected with Gal4-Acf1, Gal4, Acf1 or Gal4-HP1 performed by day 2 after transient transfection.
