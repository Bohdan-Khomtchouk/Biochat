TITLE
Identification of Zfp423-dependent genes in adult inguinal white adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We derived a model that allows for doxycycline-inducible deletion of Zfp423 in mature adipocytes of adult mice (Adiponectin-rtTA; TRE-CRE; Zfp423 loxP/loxP).  In these animals deletion of Zfp423 results in a spontaneous conversion of white adipocytes into beige-like adipocytes at room temperature. The goal of this expression analysis was to 1) determine the gene programs dependent on adipocyte Zfp423 in inguinal WAT, and 2) determine the similarity between the converted beige-like cells to normal beige adipose tissue that accumulates upon cold exppsure.

DESIGN
Inguinal white adipose tissues were isolated from adult control (Adiponectin-rtTA; TRE-Cre; Zfp423+/+ mice) and doxycycline inducible adipocyte Zfp423 knockout mice (Adiponectin-rtTA; Tre-CRE; Zfp423loxP/loxP mice) maintained at room temperature on a doxcycyline-containing diet for 28 days.  In parallel, inguinal white adipose tissues were isolated from control mice fed the doxycycline-containing diet for 28 days, but exposed to cold (6 Â°C) for the last 14 days to induce beige adipocyte accumulation. We sought to compare the similarity of Zfp423-deficient adipocytes with cold-induced beige adipocytes at the level of gene expression.
