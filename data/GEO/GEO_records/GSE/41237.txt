TITLE
Chip-chip from Candida albicans cells with HMS1-MYC, RTG1-MYC, RTG3-MYC, GFP-ZCF21, GFP-LYS14, GFP-LYS144

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The transcription regulators HMS1, RTG1, RTG3, ZCF21, LYS14 and LYS144 play roles in the proliferation of C. albicans in a mammalian host. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of HMS1-MYC, RTG1-MYC, RTG3-MYC, GFP-ZCF21, GFP-LYS14, GFP-LYS144 followed by array hybridization (Agilent) uncovered a network of target genes required for C. albicans to thrive in the host.

DESIGN
Comparison of IP/input in tagged strains to untagged cells immuniprecipitated with the same antibody.

PLATFORM
GPL13696 Candida albicans 181K tiling ChIP array (assembly Ca20)
