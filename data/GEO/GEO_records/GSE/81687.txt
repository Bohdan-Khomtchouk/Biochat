TITLE
Targeting Taxane-Platin Resistant Lung Cancers with JumonjiC Lysine Demethylase Inhibitors (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of gene expression changes upon development of taxane-platin drug resistance in NSCLC cells and further, upon treatment of these resistant cells with the Jumonji KDM inhibitor, GSK-J4.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression changes between H1299 Parental cells (chemo-sensitive) and H1299 T18 cells (taxane-platin resistant), and comparison of H1299 T18: GSK-J4 treated vs. H1299 T18: DMSO control.
