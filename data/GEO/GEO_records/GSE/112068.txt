TITLE
Study of dynamic transcriptome profiling in DNA damage-induced cellular senescence and transient cell-cycle arrest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For studing dynamic transcriptome profiling in DNA damage-induced cellular senescence and transient cell-cycle arrest, samples were treated with the DNA-damaging agent bleomycin at 0 ug/ml, 2 ug/ml and 40 ug/ml for 2 h. High-resolution time course analysis of gene expression in DNA damage-induced cellular senescence and transient cell-cycle arrest was used to explore the transcriptomic differences between different cell fates after DNA damage response.

DESIGN
Examination of IMR90 cells with different levels of DNA damage.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
