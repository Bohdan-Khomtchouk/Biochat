TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in mixed-culture wine fermentation with Hanseniaspora guilliermondii

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Natural grape-juice fermentations involve the sequential development of different yeast species which strongly influence the chemical and sensorial traits of the final product.   In the present study,we aimed to examine the transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the presence of Hanseniaspora guilliermondii wine fermentation.

DESIGN
Paralell fermentations  were carried out in natural grape-juice using S. cerevisiae for  both single and mixed culture with a H. guilliermondii strain. For RNA extraction, cells were collected at 24h, 48h and 96 h from both fermentations
