TITLE
Expression Profile of Day 5 5cc7 T cell blasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our aim was to get a general sense of which proteins are expressed in 5cc7 T cell blasts.  We use these cells for a number of different experiments in our lab Keywords: MCC peptide stimulated cells

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from day 5 5cc7 T cell blasts.  This RNA was converted to cRNA and used to hybridize 2 affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays in parallel

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
