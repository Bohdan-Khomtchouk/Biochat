TITLE
Tracing the expression of circular RNAs in human preimplantation embryos

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We systematically analyzed transcriptome in individual human oocytes and preimplantation embryos with a new single-cell RNA seq method we recently developed.

DESIGN
We sequenced individual single cells or embryos at seven consecutive stages (mature oocytes, zygotes, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell embryos, morulae, and blastocysts) and single hESC using single-cell RNA seq.
