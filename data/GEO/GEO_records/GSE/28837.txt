TITLE
Transcriptional responses to chronic oxidative stress in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We measured gene expression differences in the extensor digitorum longus (edl) skeletal muscle between wild-type and mice lacking Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase to determine the effect of chronic oxidative stress on skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
We analyzed 4 edl samples from WT mice and 4 samples from the SOD1 knockouts.
