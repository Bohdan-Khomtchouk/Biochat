TITLE
Effect in HCT116 cells of 3hr cortistatin A treatment on gene expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the marine natural product cortistatin A (CA) as an inhibitor of CDK8 to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of CDK8 regulates super-enhancer function and inhibits AML proliferation. In this series, we examine the transcriptional effect on insensitive HCT116 cells of 3hrs exposure to CA.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were treated in triplicate with either DMSO or CA for 3hrs after which RNA was harvested and prepared for RNA sequencing to assess transcriptional changes.

PLATFORM
