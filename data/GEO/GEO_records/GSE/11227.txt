TITLE
Nocturnal Hemodialysis Improves Erythropoietin Responsiveness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD) [5 – 6 times a week, 6-8 hours per session] augments uremia clearance and is associated with an increase in hemoglobin level. We have used microarray to have a global image of the changes at the gene expression. Keywords: Treatment

DESIGN
Sixteen stable end-stage renal disease patients (age: 47 ± 2 years; 9M) [mean ± SEM] were studied. Total RNA (TRNA) was isolated from whole blood before and after 3 months of established NHD. Gene expression before and after NHD was acquired through hybridizations on Human HG-U133_PLUS2 GeneChip and genes with differential gene expression were identified.
