TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Moraxella catarrhalis Grown in Pooled Human Sputum

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 43617

SUMMARY
Comparison of the gene expression profile of Moraxella catarrhalis grown in the presence of 20% pooled human sputum in chemically-defined medium relative to Moraxella catarrhalis grown in chemically-defined medium alone.

DESIGN
Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC43617 was grown to mid-logarithmic phase either in the presence of 20% pooled human sputum in chemically-defined medium or in chemically-defined medium alone.  Total RNA was extracted from bacterial cells exposed to each of these conditions and cDNA was generated for CyDye labelling.  3 biologic replicates were generated and each replicate underwent a dye swap (total of 6 experimental data collections).  The gene expression profile reported is that of Moraxella catarrhalis grown in the presence of pooled human sputum in a chemically-defined medium relative to Moraxella catarrhalis grown only in the presence of the chemically-defined medium.
