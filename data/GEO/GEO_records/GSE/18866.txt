TITLE
Expression data from doxycylin-inducible miR-15a/16-1 and empty vector (EV) expression in a 13q14-\- cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reexpression of microRNAs miR-15a/16-1 in a cell line deficient for these miRs (homozygous deletion of chromosomal region 13q14) results in the downregulation of certain mRNAs.

DESIGN
A doxycyclin-inducible expression vector containing miR-15a/16-1 was transfected into CLL-I83E95 cells that are deficient for those miRs. miR-expression was induced by addition of doxycyclin to the medium, and cell were harvested 48 hours later. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to microarrays and gene expression data were compared to CLL-I83U95 stably transfected with an empty vector.
