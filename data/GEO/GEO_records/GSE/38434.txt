TITLE
An innate fear response in domestic chicks: screening for short copy number variations associated with tonic immobility

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We performed aCGH analysis among domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) with different sensitivity in the tonic immobility (TI) to identify the copy number aberrants within genes or regions responsible for innate fear responses.

DESIGN
Four samples (high fear) were compared with a reference sample (low fear)
