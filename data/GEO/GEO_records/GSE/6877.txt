TITLE
SREBP1c and mock virus expression profiles in AG01518 human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) control the expression of most genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. In this report, using microarrays, we showed that SREBP1 also induced genes unrelated to lipid biosynthesis, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit p55-gamma, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and COTE1 (C1orf2). These genes were regulated by infection with adenoviruses encoding active SREBP1, sterols, statins and growth factors, as one would expect from SREBP1 target genes Keywords: treatment comparaison
