TITLE
Expression Project for Oncology (expO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mission of expO is to build on the technologies and outcomes of the Human Genome Project to accelerate improved clinical management of cancer patients. IGC's Expression Project for Oncology (expO) seeks to integrate longitudinal clinical annotation with gene expression data for a unique and powerful portrait of human malignancies, providing critical perspective on diagnostic markers, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic targets. The goal of expO and its consortium supporters is to procure tissue samples under standard conditions and perform gene expression analyses on a clinically annotated set of deidentified tumor samples. The tumor data is updated with clinical outcomes and is released into the public domain without intellectual property restriction. Series-matrices are available at For more information, see Keywords: cancer portraits
