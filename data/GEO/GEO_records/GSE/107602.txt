TITLE
BioProject PRJNA381064: Convergent origination of a Drosophila-like dosage compensation mechanism in a reptile lineage (Allelic Gene Expression in Anolis carolinensis, bulk tissue RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Anolis carolinensis

SUMMARY
In order to rule out the presence of imprinted X inactivation in A. carolinensis females we generated RNA-seq data from brain, heart, kidney, liver, ovary and genome sequence data from kidney.

DESIGN
Call of heterozygous SNPs of exonic regions in genomic DNA (kidney); call of expressed (allelic) SNPs from brain, heart, kidney, liver, and ovary of the same specimen.

PLATFORM
GPL15001 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Anolis carolinensis) GPL23252 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Anolis carolinensis)
