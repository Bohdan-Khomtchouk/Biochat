TITLE
Expression data from SRB embryo regions at the globular stage

ORGANISM
Phaseolus coccineus

SUMMARY
We microdissected each embryo region from 6-micron paraffin sections using the Leica AS LMD system to identify all genes active in different embryo region of an SRB seed containing globular-stage embryos. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Globular-stage embryo regions were isolated using the Leica AS LMD system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix Soybean Genome GeneChip Arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL4592 [Soybean] Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array
