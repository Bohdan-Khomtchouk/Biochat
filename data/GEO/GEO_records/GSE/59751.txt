TITLE
Twinfilin regulates breast cancer cell invasion and interleukin-11 expression through the miR-206/ MKL1/SRF pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have implicated genes that control actin cytoskeleton dynamics as important regulators in cellular invasion, a critical step in metastasis. Many of their downstream pathways still remain to be discovered. MicroRNAs have emerged as important epigenetics regulators of important cellular processes and aid in the identification of pathways involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we characterized the miR-206 downstream pathway specifically its direct target, Twinfilin (TWF1), a g-actin regulator and their downstream target, interleukin-11 (IL-11). We determined that miR-206 and TWF1 regulate IL-11 expression through the mycocardian-related transcription factor (MRTF-A or MKL1) and serum response factor (SRF) complex. Identification of this novel pathway that regulates breast cancer invasion will aid in the understanding of metastasis and development of new treatment strategies.
