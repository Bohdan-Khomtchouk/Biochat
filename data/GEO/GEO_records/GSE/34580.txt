TITLE
Gene expression response in avian enterocytes cells isolated from genetically resistant and susceptible chickens infected with Salmonella Enteritidis.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the global gene expression of enterocytes during carrier-state in chicken lines N and 61 which are respectively resistant and susceptible to Salmonella carrier-state. Transcriptome analysis was performed at three weeks post-inoculation, on purified enterocytes, by comparing the expression profiles of infected and control chicks in the two lines. Three weeks post-inoculation correspond to the period where bacterial load starts to decrease in the resistant line but is still high in the susceptible line; this point could conceptually corresponds to genes which are differentially regulated leading to the resistant or susceptible phenotypes. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes allowed us to identify numerous biological processes modulated during Salmonella carriage. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
For each chicken line, twenty slides including ten biological replicates and the corresponding dye-swaps with the fluorophores reversed were carried out on control and infected animals.
