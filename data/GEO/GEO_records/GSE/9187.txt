TITLE
Human breast cancer LM2 cell lines: control vs. MTDH knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human breast cancer cell line LM2, a subline of MDA-MB-231 highly metastatic to lung when injected to nude mice, to identify the genes that are regulated after the metastasis gene metadherin is knocked down. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Empty pSuper vector control cells were compared to the cells transfected with the MTDH knockdown shRNA construct. Two cultured conditions were studied: the LM2 cancer cells were cultured alone or on top of a monolayer of human lung endothelial HMVEC-L cells. Three arrays for each sample.
