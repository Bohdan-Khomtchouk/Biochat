TITLE
Interleukin-1-induced gene expression in mouse dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced from immune-activated cells upon infection and tissue injury, and stimulates a variety of cells expressing its receptor. IL-1 receptor activation results in intracellular signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta. To identify genes whose expression is induced in response to IL-1, we performed DNA microarray analysis of IL-1-treated murine dermal fibroblasts (DFs). The gene expression patterns in control, untreated DFs and in DFs treated with IL-1 were compared. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Total RNAs from untreated DFs (0 h) vs. IL-1-treated DFs (1 h, 2 h, or 4 h after IL-1 treatment) were isolated and analyzed using an Agilent DNA microarray platform. Hybridization was performed in duplicate for dye swapping.
