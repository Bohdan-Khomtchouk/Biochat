TITLE
Expression data from U373 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intracellular progesterone receptor (PR) presents two main isoforms: PR-A and PR-B with different function and regulation. Both isoforms have been identified in astrocytomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in humans. To investigate the role of PR activity in the regulation of gene expression pattern of U373 cells, we evaluated by microarray analysis the profile of genes regulated by progesterone (10 nM), by a progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486, 10 ÂµM) or by both steroids.

DESIGN
The human astrocytoma cell line U373 was treated with progesterone; the antagonist, RU-486 or a combination of both drugs.Subsecuently, total RNA was extracted and hybridised on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 STs.
