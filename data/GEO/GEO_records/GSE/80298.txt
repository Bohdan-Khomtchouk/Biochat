TITLE
Study of RepID/PHIP in DNA Replication inhitiation in Mammalian Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mammalian chromosome replication starts from distinct sites, but the principles  governing initiation site selection are unclear because proteins essential for DNA  replication do not exhibit sequence-specific DNA binding. We identified a replication  initiation determinant (RepID) protein that binds a subset of replication initiation sites.  A large fraction of RepID binding sites share a common G-rich motif and exhibit elevated  replication initiation. RepID is required for initiation of DNA replication from Rep-ID  bound replication origins, including the origin at the human beta-globin (HBB) locus. At  HBB, RepID is involved in an interaction between the replication origin (Rep-P) and the  locus control region. RepID depleted murine embryonic fibroblasts exhibit abnormal  replication fork progression and fewer replication initiation events. These observations  are consistent with a model suggesting that RepID facilitates replication initiation at a  distinct group of human replication origins.

DESIGN
Nascent strands were purified with the lambda exonuclease methods from HCT116 cells and sequenced. Chromatin from unsyncrhonized untreated cultures of U2OS cells was subjected to ChIP-Seq with antibody directed against RepID/PHIP
