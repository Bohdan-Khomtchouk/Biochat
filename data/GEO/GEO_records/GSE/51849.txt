TITLE
mRNA expression profiles of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells induced by DNA prime-DNA boost and DNA prime-VACV boost immunization regimen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Similar with others, our data proved that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from mice primed with DNA and boosted by VACV were much more sensitive to antigen stimulation than those from DNA-boost. Since the mechanisms of in vivo tuning of antigen sensitivity (also termed functional avidity) is still not defined, we compared this two vaccination regimen at gene expression level. Results provide important information of which genes were selectively activated by VACV boost vaccination. For example, data shows that the expression levels of genes involved in Cancer and Wnt signaling pathways is more higher in DNA prime-VACV boost regimen that DNA prime-DNA boost vaccination.

DESIGN
To obtain sufficient of antigen-specific cells for microarray analysis, the OVA-specific CD8+ T cells from OT-1 mice were adoptively transferred into wild type mice and then immunized by DNA and VACV vaccine encoding OVA. Four week later, mice were scarificed and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were emriched by CD45.1-PE antibody and anti-PE MicroBeads from splenocytes.Total RNA was extracted by the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Followed by amplification and biotin labeling, the samples were hybridized using Illumina Total Prep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, USA). Mouse WG-6v2 Expression BeadChips were used for analysis of transcriptome.
