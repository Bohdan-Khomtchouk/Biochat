TITLE
The integrative omics of white-rot fungus Pycnoporus coccineus reveals co-regulated CAZymes for orchestrated lignocellulose breakdown.

ORGANISM
Trametes coccinea

SUMMARY
White-rot basidiomycete fungi are potent degraders of plant biomass with the ability to mineralize all lignocellulose components. Recent comparative genomics studies showed that these fungi use a wide diversity of enzymes for wood degradation. In order to improve our understanding on the enzymatic mechanisms leading to lignocellulose breakdown, we analysed the early response of the white-rot  fungus Pycnoporus coccineus CIRM-BRFM310  to various lignocellulosic substrates at two time points; Day 3 and Day 7.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in fungal mycelium after 3 and 7 days growth in liquid cultures on maltose, wheat straw, pine or aspen. Each culture was done in triplicate. mRNA were sequenced using 75 bp paired end reads on Illumina HighSeq-2500. The reads were mapped on the genome Pycnoporus coccineus BRFM 310 v1.0 available on the Mycocosm portal at http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Pycco1/Pycco1.home.html
