TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of dikaryotic colonies of Schizophyllum commune under various conditions: wild-type, delta-wc2, delta-wc2 hsp3(pr)-wc2

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
The blue light receptor WC-2 was shown to be involved in mushroom development in the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune. When the gene encoding WC-2 was deleted, no mushrooms formed and colony morphology was radial. This phenotype was similar to the wild-type colony grown in the dark. This phenotype could be complemented by transforming the wc-2 deletion strain with a construct encompassing the wc-2 coding sequence under the control of the heat inducible promoter hsp3. A daily heat shock of 1 hour at 42 degrees Celsius resulted in mushroom development and an asymmetrical colony. In this study we performed a genome-wide expression analysis on dikaryons of wild-type (not heat shocked), delta-wc2 (heat shocked or not heat shocked) and the complemented strain delta-wc2 hsp3-wc2 (heat shocked or not heat shocked).

DESIGN
A total of five samples were analyzed. One wild-type (not heat shocked), delta-wc2 (heat shocked or not heat shocked) and the complemented strain delta-wc2 hsp3-wc2 (heat shocked or not heat shocked).
