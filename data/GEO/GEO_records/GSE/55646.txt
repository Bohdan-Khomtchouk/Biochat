TITLE
Genes affected by SFRP5 overexpression in LSK cells and CLP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand  gene expression signatures between wild-type and SFRP5-overexpressing cells

DESIGN
To examine genes regulated by SFRP5 expression, sets of microarrays were conducted with Lin- c-kitHi Sca-1+ cells and Lin- c-kitLo Sca-1Lo IL7RÎ±+ CLP-enriched cells derived from adult bone marrow of SFRP5-transgenic mice or their WT littermates.

PLATFORM
