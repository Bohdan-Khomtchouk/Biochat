TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis wild type Col and mutant pcfs4-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis polyadenylation factor PCFS4 functioned in the alternative polyadenylation of FCA. To identify additional genes differetially processed by PCFS4, we compared the transcriptomes of PCFS4 mutant, pcfs4-1 and wild type Col with  Arabidopsis tiling array analyses and a newly developed data processing protocol, RADPRE. We found 68 genes were differentially processed and 114 genes differetially expressed in pcfs4-1 mutant. The top 7 of 68 differetially processed genes were further confirmed with real-time RT-PCR analysis.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis plants were grown in a radomized block design with 3 replicates for each of pcfs4-1 and Col. Each block contained one pcfs4-1 and one Col. above ground tissue of 15-day old seedlings was collected 8 hours after dawn. Total RNAs were extracted using Concert Plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen); The double-stranded cDNA targets prepared from total RNA were labeled and hybridized to the Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R array.
