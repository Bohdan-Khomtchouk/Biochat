TITLE
Gene expression analysis in sensitive and tolerant Citrus rootstocks under chlorotic conditions

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis x Citrus trifoliata ; Citrus x paradisi x Citrus trifoliata

SUMMARY
Iron chlorosis is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting fruit trees and other crops in calcareous soils. The most evident symptoms are connected to a reduction in growth and yield and in the interveinal chlorosis of leaves.   A custom CombiMatrix 90K microarray was used to identify candidate genes involved in the citrus response to iron deficiency stress, comparing Tarocco Scirè orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] grafted on two different rootstocks, Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi × Poncirus trifoliata), high sensitive, and Carrizo citrange (C. sinensis × P. trifoliata), tolerant. RNA was extracted from roots of plants grown in two different soils, one volcanic (0% of active lime) used as control, and the other calcareous (10% of active lime).

DESIGN
Root tips of two citrus rootstocks, Carrizo Citrange and Swingle Citrumelo, respectively tolerant and sensitive to iron deficiency, each grown in two different soil (volcanic, considered as a control with 0% of active lime, and chlorotic, with 10% of active lime) were analyzed. Three biological replicates were taken for each sample, resulting in a total of twelve observations.
