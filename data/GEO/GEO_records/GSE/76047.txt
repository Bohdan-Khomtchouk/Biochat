TITLE
Identification of gene expression changes in wild type vs. Pitx2-null cornea.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identifycandidate PITX2-dependent genes during corneal development, microarray analysis was used to profile gene expression in corneas taken from flash-frozen e12.5 mouse embryos of control (Pitx2+/-) and temporal knockout Pitx2-deficient embryos.

DESIGN
To identify candidate PITX2-dependent targets, gene was independently measured in corneal tissue isolated from four embryos of each geneotype.  Corneal tissue isolated from both eyes of a given embryo were pooled and constituted an individual sample pool.
