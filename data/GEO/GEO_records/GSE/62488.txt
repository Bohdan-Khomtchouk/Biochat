TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of a rice line carrying Xa39 and its parents triggered by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae provides novel insights into the broad-spectrum hypersensitive response

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To dissect the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by Xa39,the transcriptome profiling of a rice line carrying Xa39 and its parents at the early stage of Xoo infection were investigated. A rice introgression line H471 carrying Xa39 exhibited a typical local hypersensitive response phenotype, accompanied by programmed cell death after inoculation with the Xoo Philippinesâ€™ race 9b.Our results indicated there might be cross-talk between the Xa39-mediated signal transduction cascades and the GA/BR signaling pathway, and the defense mechanism was related to diverse kinases, transcription factors, post-translational regulation, and R genes.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of H471 and its parents (HHZ and P28) at 1 and 2 days post-inoculation was performed using RNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
