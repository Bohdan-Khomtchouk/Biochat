Transcriptional response of terminal ileum to bacterial monocolonization

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile of the terminal ileum of GF mice or mice monocolonized with three different bacterial species (C. histolyticum, B. adolescentis, or SFB) for 2 weeks.

DESIGN
A small 3-5 mm segment of the terminal ileum of mice was placed directly into TRIzol.
