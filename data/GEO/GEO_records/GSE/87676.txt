TITLE
Transcriptional response of terminal ileum to bacterial monocolonization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile of the terminal ileum of GF mice or mice monocolonized with three different bacterial species (C. histolyticum, B. adolescentis, or SFB) for 2 weeks.

DESIGN
A small 3-5 mm segment of the terminal ileum of mice was placed directly into TRIzol.
