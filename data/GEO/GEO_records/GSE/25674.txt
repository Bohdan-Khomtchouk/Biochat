TITLE
Genomic Profiling of HMGN1 Reveals an Association with Chromatin at Regulatory Regions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High mobility group (HMG) proteins interact with other architectural proteins to regulate chromatin structure. We performed genome-wide mapping experiments to examine the distribution of HMGN1 across the human genome.  We discovered that HMGN1 proteins are enriched at regulatory regions such as DNase I HS sites, distal transcription factor binding sites and promoters of actively transcribed genes. YY1, the Yin Yang 1 transcription factor, is a ubiquitous transcription factor that functions either as a transcriptional activator or a repressor, depending on its interacting partner. To test the preferential localization of HMGN1 with active regulatory regions, we examined the association of transcription factor YY1 and HMGN1 in CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Examination of the genomic profile of HMGN1 and the relationship with regulatory elements in CD4+ T cells.
