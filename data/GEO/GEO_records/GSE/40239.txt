TITLE
Development and blind clinical validation of a microRNA based predictor of response to treatment with R-CHOEP in DLBCL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNAs er are group of short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranslational level. It has been shown that mirs are independent predictios of outcome in patients with diffuse large b cell lymphoma treated with r-chop. Outcome in patients with dlbcl lymphoma treated with r-chop. Based on the measured GI50 in 60 human cell lines.

DESIGN
116 DLBCL samples

PLATFORM
