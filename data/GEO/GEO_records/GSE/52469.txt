TITLE
Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 is a chromatin-bound cofactor for nuclear factor kappaB-dependent gene expression [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Given the intimate link between inflammation and dysregulated cell proliferation in cancer we investigated cytokine-triggered gene expression in different cell cycle stages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that G1 release through CDK6 and CDK4 primes and cooperates with the cytokine-driven gene response. CDK6 physically and functionally interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 in the nucleus and is found at enhancers and promoters of many transcriptionally active NF-κB target genes. CDK6 recruitment to distinct chromatin regions of inflammatory genes was essential for proper loading of p65 to its cognate binding sites and for the function of p65 coactivators such as TRIP6. Furthermore, cytokine-inducible nuclear translocation and chromatin association of CDK6 depends on the kinase activity of TAK1 and p38. These results have widespread biological implications, as aberrant CDK6 expression or activation that is frequently observed in human tumors cooperates with NF-κB to shape the cytokine- and chemokine-repertoire in chronic inflammation and cancer.
