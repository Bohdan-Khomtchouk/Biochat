TITLE
Array-based genotyping and expression analysis of barley cv. Maythorpe and Golden Promise

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Salt Stress response of salt-tolerant genotype Golden Promise compared to Maythorpe Barley1 GeneChip was used to find differential expression between two barley genotypes under control and salt stress conditions at vegetative stage of growth Keywords: genotype and treatment comparison

DESIGN
Roots (tips) and shoot (crown and growing point) tissue was used for hybridization to GeneChips

PLATFORM
