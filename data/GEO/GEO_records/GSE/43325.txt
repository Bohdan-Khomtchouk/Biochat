TITLE
Atypical Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Virulence Regulation by QseC Quorum Sensing Adrenergic Sensor

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Atypical EPEC (aEPEC) strains are part of group of pathogens capable of forming the Attaching and Effacing (A/E) lesion. This lesion is characterized by intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, and microvilli destruction. The genes responsible to cause that lesion are located in a pathogenicity island called Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE). Transcription of LEE genes is subjected to various levels of regulation, including quorum sensing through autoinducer 3 (AI-3) system. AI-3 is an aromatic compound with similar characteristics to the epinephrine and norepinephrine hormones. This similarity allows bacteria to use these hormones and AI-3 to perform cell – to – cell signaling processes and bacteria - host communication processes in order to modulate its virulence. AI-3, epinephrine and norepinephrine are detected by a sensor kinase named quorum sensing E.coli regulator (QseC). In order to investigate the role of QseC and epinephrine in atypical EPEC O55:H7 virulence, we constructed a QseC mutant of this strain and performed transcription and phenotypic analyses in the presence or absence of epinephrine. We have reported here, for the first time, the quorum sensing QseC regulation of virulence genes in atypical EPEC. Our results shown that QseC is a global regulator of gene expression in aEPEC and positively regulates flagellar genes, LEE and non-LEE encoded factors. We also have shown that the presence of epinephrine could be sensed by other receptor that acts as negative regulator of LEE4 and LEE5 genes.
