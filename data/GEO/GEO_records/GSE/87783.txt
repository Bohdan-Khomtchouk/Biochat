TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in MYC and PRC2 targets are prominent events in the early pathogenesis of neuroblastoma in TH-MYCN mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been already reported that there are undifferentiated/proliferating neuroblasts in the postnatal sympathetic ganglia in TH-MYCN mice. We established suitable spheroid culture condition that selectively isolates undifferentiated neuroblasts from superior mesenteric ganligon (SMG) of TH-MYCN mice. In the present study, in order to investigate the transcriptomic differences between embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) WT derived primary spheres and E13.5 TH-MYCN derived passageable spheres, we carried out microarray gene expression analysis. We investigated critical molecular events in MYCN-transformed neuroblastoma cells in TH-MYCN mice.

DESIGN
Primary spheres were cultured from E13.5 WT SMG. Passageable spheres were obtained by subculturing spheres from E13.5 TH-MYCN SMG. Four individual biological replicates of E13.5 WT spheres and E13.5 TH-MYCN spheres were subjected to micorarray analyis (two arrays were used for one replicate except for one WT sample).
