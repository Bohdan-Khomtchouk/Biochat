TITLE
Bone marrow-derived macrophages express distinct transcriptional programs when activated by LPS, IFN-gamma and PAO.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA microarray analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages treated under four conditions, including Naïve (N).  Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were derived from the bone marrow of mice and cultured in the presence of PAO, IFN-gamma, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Profiled groups include Naive, LPS, IFN, PAO.

DESIGN
Compared each of the  groups (PAO, LPS, IFN) with Naïve group.
