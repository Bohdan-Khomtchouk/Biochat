TITLE
Gene expression data of pHGG tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) harboring the K27M mutation of H3F3A (histone H3.3) are characterized by global reduction of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and DNA hypomethylation. Analysis of K27M-induced changes on H3K27me3 occupancy and DNA methylation at differentially expresed genes (K27M vs. wild-type H3.3) in primary pHGG tumor samples.

DESIGN
22 glioblastoma samples from pHGG patients were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Expression profiling data of 17 pHHGs are part of our previous study (GSE36245 or GSE34824).
