TITLE
RPB1 mutants sensitive to 6-AU

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of RNA pol II mutants. In vivo effects of mutations in residues 260 (rudder), 261 (rudder), 320 (lid), 488 (close to catalytic center), 1230 (required for TFIIS stimulation) and 1103. Keywords: Gene expression profiling of RNA pol II mutants

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of RPB1 mutants in rich media to characterize the biological response to deficient RNApol II, and to identify genes difficult to transcribe in such mutants.
