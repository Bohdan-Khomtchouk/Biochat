TITLE
Whole Genome Segregation of light and nitrate effect in rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The current study aimed at segregating the light and nitrate effect in rice plants (Oryza sativa indica). The primary aim of the study was to demarcate the genes that were purely regulated by light and nitrate. A separate list of genes that were co-regulated by these two signals would provide insights into the exact mode of regulation of primary metabolic pathways.

DESIGN
Rice plants (Oryza sativa indica) were grown in light with  12 hour diurnals in the absence of nutrients at 25 Â°C for 8-10 days before being treated with 120 mM nitrate prior to RNA isolation. In case of dark experiments the plants were grown in total darkness and treated with 120mM nitrate in dark prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from 2 separate biological replicates for each treatment.Two-color arrays were performed for each treatment. Flip dye replicates were performed with biological replicates being flip dye labeled i.e. The biological replicates for individual treatments were labeled with opposite dyes.
