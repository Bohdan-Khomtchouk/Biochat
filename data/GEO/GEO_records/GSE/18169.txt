TITLE
Comparative Genome Hybridization of Porphyromonas gingivalis strains

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
CGH was used to compare the genomes of a non-invading P. gingivalis strain to the database W83 strain (invader). For hybridization and scanning, TIGR microarrays and protocols were used. The results were independently processed using two different software packages.

DESIGN
We used P. gingivalis microarrays in comparative genomics to specifically address the P. gingivalis invasive genotype using invasive and non-invasive phenotypes.
