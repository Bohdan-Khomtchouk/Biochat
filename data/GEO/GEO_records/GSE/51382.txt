TITLE
Retroviral overexpression or siRNA mediated knockdown of FOXP1 in DLBCL cell lines and primary human B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To provide insight into the role of and target genes of the transcription factor FOXP1 in mature human B cells and in B cell non-Hodkgin lymhomas, we performed gene expression microarray studies, upon ectopic overexpression or silencing of FOXP1 in these cells.

DESIGN
human memory B cells from 2 separate donors were transduced with LZRS-FOXP1-IRES-YFP or LZRS-IRES-YFP (negative control); DLBCL cell lines OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly7, and OCI-Ly10 were transduced with LZRS-FOXP1-IRES-YFP or LZRS-IRES-YFP (negative control);  DLBCL cell lines OCI-Ly1, OCI-Ly7, and OCI-Ly10  were transiently transfected with siRNA targeting FOXP1 or sigenome non-targeting siRNA (negative control), using the Lonza nucleofection system.
