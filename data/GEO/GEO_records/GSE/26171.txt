TITLE
Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to Patulin and Ascorbic acid

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The assessment of toxicity about patulin using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. Yeast BY4743 derivative SOD1 mutant was used for this study. Ascorbic acid was used to evaluate the anti-toxic effect to patulin. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Four series of samples were compared with each by ANOVA analysis. Each strain was grown in YPD medium, and they were also incubated with 25 ppm of patulin and 10 mM ascorbic acid.
