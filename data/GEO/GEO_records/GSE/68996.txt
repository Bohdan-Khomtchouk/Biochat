TITLE
Expression analysis of Listeria monocytogenes LO28 delta-lhrC1-5 mutant and LO28 wt

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes LO28

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Listeria monocytogenes LO28 delta-lhrC1-5 mutant, compared to the wild type strain. The lhrC1-5 genes encode the regulatory sRNAs LhrC1-5. The microarray studied the gene expression of unstressed cells and cells exposed to cefuroxime for 30 min. The lhrC1-5 mutant employed in this study is further described in Sievers et al. (2014) A multicopy sRNA of Listeria monocytogenes regulates expression of the virulence adhesin LapB. Nucleic Acids Res. 42:9383-98.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using RNA extracted from 6 different cultures of L. monocytogenes LO28 delta-lhrC1-5 (three unstressed and three stressed cultures) and 6 different cultures of L. monocytognes LO28 wild-type (three unstressed cultures and three stressed cultures).
