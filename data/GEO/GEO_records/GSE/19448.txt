TITLE
A Functional Role of RB-Dependent Pathway in the Control of Quiescence in Adult Epidermal Stem Cells Revealed by Genomic Profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Continuous cell renewal in mouse epidermis is at the expense of a pool of pluripotent cells that lie in a well defined niche in the hair follicle known as the bulge. To identify mechanisms controlling hair follicle stem cell homeostasis, we developed a strategy to isolate adult bulge stem cells in mice and to define their transcriptional profile. We observed that a large number of transcripts are underexpressed in hair follicle stem cells when compared to non-stem cells. Importantly, the majority of these downregulated genes are involved in cell cycle. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified the E2F transcription factor family as a potential element involved in the regulation of these transcripts. To determine their functional role, we used engineered mice lacking Rb gene in epidermis, which showed increased expression of most E2F family members and increased E2F transcriptional activity. Experiments designed to analyze epidermal stem cell functionality (i.e.: hair regrowth and wound healing) imply a role of the Rb-E2F axis in the control of stem cell quiescence in epidermis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from CD34+ and CD34- keratinocytes obtained from pools of at least six mice per MACS isolation procedure. A total of three isolation procedures were performed. RNA extracted from each fraction (CD34+ / CD34-) was assessed for its quality using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and hybridized to two Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 arrays, to ensure reproducibility of the process. This resulted in a total of 12 chips (6 CD34+ / 6 CD34-).
