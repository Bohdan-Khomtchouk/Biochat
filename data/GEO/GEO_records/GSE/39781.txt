TITLE
RNA-seq in wild-type and glass mutant eye-antennal discs in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this data set is to perform a differential expression analysis between wild type eye-antennal imaginal disc and discs that are homozygous glass mutant gl[60j]. This data set is used to validate Glass target gene predictions identified by i-cisTarget on a set of conserved eye-specific genes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed in eye-antennal imaginal discs of two D.melanogaster wild-type strains (Canton S and strain RAL-208 (Jordan et al. 2007, Ayroles et al. 2009)), representing two biological replicates; and in glass mutant (gl[60j]) discs for two technical replicates.
