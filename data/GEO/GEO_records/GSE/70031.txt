TITLE
Next Generation RNA-Sequencing data of Hematopoietic stem cells and CML stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate why dipeptides accumulate in immature CML cells, we examined upstream gene expression patterns. We isolated the most primitive long-term stem cells, short-term stem cells, and KLS- progenitor cells from healthy littermate control and CML-affected mice and performed gene expression profiling using next-generation RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of the most primitive long-term (LT) stem cells (CD150+CD48-CD135-KLS+ cells), short-term (ST) stem cells (CD150-CD48-CD135- KLS+ cells), and KLS- progenitor cells from healthy littermate control and CML-affected mice
