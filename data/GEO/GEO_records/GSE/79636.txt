TITLE
NextGen Consortium: GENESiPS Study: Identifying the Gene Networks of Insulin Resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq transcriptome profiling of human induced pluripotent stem cells to characterize gene expression variation across individuals and within multiple iPSC lines from the same individual

DESIGN
Donor erythroblast or activated T-cells were reprogrammed with a Sendai viral vector coding for reprogramming factors.  IPSC lines were propagated for ~9 passages before RNA sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
