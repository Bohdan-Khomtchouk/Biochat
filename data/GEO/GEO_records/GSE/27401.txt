TITLE
Caenorhabditis elegans infection with Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
N2 young adult animals were analyzed four hours after exposure to wild-type Candida albicans DAY185, heat-killed C. albicans DAY185 and heat-killed Escherichia coli OP50, all on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar.  It was necessary to use heat-killed E. coli OP50 as a control for these experiments because live E. coli OP50 (the normal nematode food source) is pathogenic to nematodes on BHI agar.  These data identify the C. elegans genes that are differentially regulated during nematode infection with a human fungal pathogen.

DESIGN
There are nine samples total that comprise three biological replicates of animals exposed to live C. albicans, heat-killed C. albicans and heat-killed E. coli.  For a given biological replicate, young adult N2 C. elegans were exposed to live C. albicans, heat-killed C. albicans and heat-killed E. coli in parallel to each other.
