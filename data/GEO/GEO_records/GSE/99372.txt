TITLE
Erythropoietin Signaling Regulates Key Epigenetic and Transcription Networks in Fetal Neural Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor are highly expressed in the developing nervous system, and is exogenous EPO therapy is potentially neuroprotective, however the epigenetic and transcriptional changes downstream of EPO signaling in neural cells are not well understood. To delineate epigenetic changes associated with EPO signaling, we compared histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) in EPO treated and control fetal neural progenitor cells, identifying 1,150 differentially bound regions. These regions were highly enriched near protein coding genes and had significant overlap with H4Acetylation, a mark of active regulatory elements.  Motif analyses and co-occupancy studies revealed a complex regulatory network underlying the differentially bound regions, including previously identified mediators of EPO signaling (STAT5, STAT3), and novel factors such as REST, an epigenetic modifier central to neural differentiation and plasticity, and NRF1, a key regulator of antioxidant response and mitochondrial biogenesis.  Global transcriptome analyses on neural tubes isolated from E9.0 EpoR-null and littermate control embryos validated our in vitro findings, further suggesting a role for REST and NRF1 downstream of EPO signaling. These data support a role for EPO in regulating the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and suggest a basis for its function in neural development and neuroprotection. The human sequencing data is not shared publicly due to privacy concerns, but is available from the investigators on request
