TITLE
Induction of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b upon exposure to concentrations of biocides

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b str. F2365

SUMMARY
Study on genome-wide expression in L.monocytogenes str4b F2365 exposed to five different biocides at three different concentrations

DESIGN
The study was carried out with a total of 34 microarrays using total RNA recovered from L.monocytogenes str4b F2365, which has been exposed for 1 hour (t =1) to five different biocides at three different concentrations (sub-inhibitory as well as inhibitory) in two-fold (30 exps). As reference samples, RNA of untreated cells were used in two-fold directly after pre-culturing (t=0) and after one hour of preculturing (t=1 hour; 4 exps). Each microarray read out includes expression levels of 2,821 genes from L.monocytogenes str4b F2365in two-fold, with a total of twelve 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene.
