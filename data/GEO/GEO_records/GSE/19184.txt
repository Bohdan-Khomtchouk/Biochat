TITLE
Cross species hybridization of human cancer cells xenografted into different mouse organ sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test gene expression changes of human cancer cells and mouse surrounding tissue cells during tumor progression, 4 different types of cancer cells (MDA-MB231Br3, PC14Br4, KM12M, A375SM) were injected into mouse brain, skin and orthotopic sites. RNAs containing human cancer cells and mouse surrounding tissue cells were extracted and hybridized into human and mouse arrays at the same times and it revealed the brain microenvironment induced complete reprogramming of metasized cancer cells, resulting in a gain of neuronal cell characteristic , mimicking neurogenesis during development.
