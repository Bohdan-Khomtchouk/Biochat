TITLE
knock-out Slr1738 mutant strain analysis exposed to cadmium (50 microM).

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The transcriptome approach was used to characterize the global change in slr1738 null-mutant gene expression in response to cadmium (50 microM, 180 min), compared to wild type strain gene expression in response to cadmium (50 microM, 180 min). Total RNA were isolated from null-mutant and wild type stressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labelled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point) (Custom-commercial array : IntelliGeneTM CyanoCHIP version 2.0, TAKARA). To identify differentially expressed genes, the median of the normalized ratio of Cy5/Cy3 intensity was calculated for each spot of the replicated dye-swap. The results of the analysis were carefully examined to exclude the dye effect between the 2 Cy-swapped arrays. Keywords: stress responses
