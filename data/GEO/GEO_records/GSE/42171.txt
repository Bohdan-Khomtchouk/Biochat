TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6 array data for ACTH-Independent Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia (AIMAH) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AIMAH is an ACTH-independent bilateral enlargement of the adrenal cortex occuring during adulthood. The enlargment is related to the growth of multiple benign nodules. This condition is associated with various degrees of cortisol hypersecretion. The occurence of several nodules in both adrenals, and the existence of familial forms, suggest the existence of a germline genetic predisposition. To find the gene(s), the aim of the project was to look for recurrent chromosomal alterations in the AIMAH nodules. Extensive mapping of somatic gains, losses and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was performed with Affymetrix SNP6 arrays. A copy neutral LOH of 16p, occuring in 7 of 26 patients, was one of the only recurrent alterations, pointing towards a candidate gene in this region. Of note this condition differs from the congenital adrenal hyperplasias, related to genetic alterations of steroidogenesis (the latter is an ACTH dependent adrenal hyperplasia). Affymetrix SNP6 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved tumor samples or peripheral blood samples.

DESIGN
Copy number and LOH analysis of Affymetrix SNP6 arrays was performed for AIMAH nodules from 26 patients, including 18 with paired leucocyte and nodules (1 to 4 nodules per patient), and 8 with a single nodule (no paired leucocyte available)
