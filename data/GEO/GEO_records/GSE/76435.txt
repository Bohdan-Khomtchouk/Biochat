TITLE
Identification of chilling responsive microRNAs and their targets in vegetable soybean (Glycine max L.)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Chilling stress is a major factor limiting the yield and quality of vegetable soybean    (Glycine max L.) on a global scale. Systematic identification and function analysis of    miRNA under chilling stress could be helpful to clarify the molecular mechanism of    chilling resistance. In the present study, two independent small RNA libraries from leaves    of vegetable soybean were constructed, and sequenced with the high-throughput Illumina    Solexa system. A total of 434 known miRNAs and three novel miRNAs were identified.    Moreover, the expression patterns of these miRNAs have been verified by qRT-PCR    analysis. Furthermore, we identified their gene targets by high-throughput degradome    sequencing and validated using 5'-RACE. A total of 898 transcripts were targeted by 54    miRNA  families  attributed  to  five  categories.  More  importantly,  we  identified  55    miRNAs that differentially expressed between chilling stress and the control. The targets    of  these  miRNAs  were  enriched  in  oxidation-reduction,  signal  transduction,  and    metabolic  process  functional  categories.  The  qRT-PCR  confirmed  that  there  was  a    negative relationship among the miRNAs and their targets under chilling stress. Our work    provides comprehensive molecular evidence for the possible involvement of miRNAs in    the process of chilling-stress responses in vegetable soybean.

DESIGN
24h chilling treatment and control were collected to extract total RNA to do small RNA sequencing and pooled to do degradome sequencing.

PLATFORM
