TITLE
Semilunar valve phenotype of Cxcr7-/- neonates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cxcr7-/- mice die a few hours after birth. All of them display semilunar valves abnormalities, including bicuspid aortic or pulmonary valves. Those defects only become obvious before birth. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Biological replicates of pools of 3 mutant samples (2 valves with 2-3 leaflets each, so 4-6 leaflets/mutant) and 3 wildtype littermates (6 leaflets/wildtype).
