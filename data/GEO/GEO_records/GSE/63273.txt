TITLE
Role of de novo DNA methyltransferases in hematopoietic stem cells (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigate the dynamics for Histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 during Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b knockout in mouse hematopoietic stem cells. The term dko represents double knockout of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, while the term sko denotes single knockout of Dnmt3a. The Wildtype profiles were generated in study GSE47765.

DESIGN
Mouse hematopoietic stem cell histone methylation profiles of sko and dko mice were generated generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000
