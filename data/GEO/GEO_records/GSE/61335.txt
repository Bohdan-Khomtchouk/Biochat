TITLE
AKT pathway genes define 5 prognostic subgroups in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GBM samples were clusered using gene expression of AKT pathway genes to reveal at least 5 GBM AKT subtypes, having distinct DNA copy number alterations, enrichment in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and patterns of expression for PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling components.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled on 39 GBM samples plus 6 normal controls from UCSF, as well as 9 GBM samples plus 8 normal controls from MDA. This data was combined with published GBM gene expression data from MDA [GSE4271] and UCLA [GSE4412] obtained on the same platform to reveal GBM subtypes based on AKT pathway genes.
