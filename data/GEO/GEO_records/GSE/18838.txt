TITLE
Gene Expression in the Blood of Parkinson's Disease Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood was collected from 18 Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and 12 healthy controls (Ctrls). Total RNA was isolated and hybridized onto Affymetrix Exon_ST1 arrays to find in PDs versus controls: 1) genes that are differentiallly expressed and 2) genes with differential exonic expression (alternative splicing).

DESIGN
17 PD samples vs 11 Control samples

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
