TITLE
Expression data from 128 Desmoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One of the main problems in managing desmoids tumors is their locoregional aggressiveness and their high ability to recur after initial treatment. In our work, with the goal to identify molecular markers that can predict Progression-Free Survival, gene-expression screening was conducted on 128 available independent untreated primary desmoid tumors using cDNA microarray. By analyzing expression profiles, we have identified, for the first time, a gene expression signature that is able to predict Progression-Free Survival. This molecular signature identified two groups with clearly distinct Progression-Free Survival in the two sets of subjects. Patients in good prognostic group had achieved a progression-free 2-year survival rate of 86% while patients in poor prognostic group had a progression-free 2-year survival rate of 44%.
