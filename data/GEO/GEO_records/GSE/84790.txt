TITLE
lncRNA expression profiles in OSCC cells cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxic microenvironment plays important roles in the progression of solid tumors including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained much attention in the past few years. However, it is not clear whether lncRNAs could regulate hypoxia-adaptation of OSCC, and which lncRNAs participate in this process. Using an lncRNA microarray, we analyzed the aberrant lncRNA expression profiles in OSCC tissues compared with paired normal oral mucosa as well as in hypoxic OSCC cells compared with normoxic OSCC cells. Our microarray also identified 942 lncRNAs that were up-regulated and 507 lncRNAs that were down-regulated in cells cultured under hypoxia compared with those cultured under normoxia (Fold Change > = 2.0, P-value < = 0.05).

DESIGN
An OSCC cell line Cal-27 was cultured under either 20% O2 (normoxic) or 1% O2 (hypoxic) conditions. Three samples from each group were obtained for microarray study.
