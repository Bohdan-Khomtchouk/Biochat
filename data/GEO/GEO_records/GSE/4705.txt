TITLE
genome-wide expression analysis of the highly metastatic lung cancer cell line NCI-H460-LNM35

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Widespread metastasis is the major cause of human lung cancer-related deaths, but there is much to be elucidated about underlying mechanism. Based on the genome-wide expression analysis of the highly metastatic lung cancer cell line NCI-H460-LNM35 (LNM35), we identified a cancer metastasis signature composed of 45 genes with previously uncharacterized features but well-known associations with human cancers including CXCL1, IER3, PTTG1, DAD1, METAP2, E-cadherin and galectin 3. In addition, the 45-gene metastasis signature gene set was significantly associated with a subset of primary tumors with poor prognosis not only in the lung but also the breast. Keywords: cell-line morphologic comparison

DESIGN
Two sets of membrane cDNA microarrays (GeneFilter Human Microarrays Release I and Release II; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing a total of 11,168 spots corresponding to 8,644 independent genes, were used to analyze genome-wide expression analysis in duplicate between highly metastatic lung cancer cell line NCI-H460-LNM35 and low metastatic NCI-H460-N15.
