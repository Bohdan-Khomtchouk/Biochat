TITLE
YAP mediates crosstalk between the Hippo and PI3K-TOR pathway by suppressing PTEN via miR-29

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify microRNAs that are regulated by YAP in human mammary epithelial cells.

DESIGN
We utilized deep sequencing technology to identify microRNAs that are induced by YAP overexpression and repressed by YAP knockdown.
