TITLE
Gene expression in Aspergillus fumigatus at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare different divelopmental stages of the filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus af293. Cells were grone for various times and comparisons made between: 1. Dormant conidia (0 hours) and isotropically expanding cells (1hr). 2. Dormant conidia (0 hours) and isotropically expanding cells (2hr) . 3. Dormant conidia (0 hours) and isotropically expanding cells (4hr).  4.  Isotropically expanding cells (4hr) and polarity extending cells (6hr). 4.  Isotropically expanding cells (4hr) and germ tube (8hr).

DESIGN
A total of 6 hybridizations were performed for each microarray experiment described in summary. The following replicates were carried out: 1. Three biological replicates were performed using cultures grown in parallel. 2. Technical 'dye swap' replicates were carried out for each biological replicate. Please note that [1] each array slide has two spots of same probes, and thus, data was merged and analyzed as described in the sample data processing field. [2] The normalized data derived from each raw data file 'before the intensities across two technical repeats are averaged' are provided in the *normalized_MDS.mev file and sample data tables include the averaged data of two technical repeats. [3] For the value in each sample data table, we have performed dye-swapped two slides and normalized at same time. Each slide have two spots for one gene, so we performed In-slide replicate analysis (averaged) and statistic analysis. At final step, fold change ratio (FC) was calculated as 1hr/0hr, 2hr/0hr, 4hr/0hr, 6hr/4hr, 8hr/4hr in each experiment as and then Log2-treansformed (log2 FC).
