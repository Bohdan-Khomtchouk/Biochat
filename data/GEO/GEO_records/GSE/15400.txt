TITLE
Conditioned media from SDEC supports human embryonic stem cell proliferation on type I collagen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Conditioned media from a human embryonic germ cell-derived line called SDEC was found to be supportive of human embryonic stem cell growth in the absence of feeder layers on a simple type I collagen matrix.  We performed gene expression studies comparing this line to non-supportive cell lines (WI-38 and Detroit 551) to try to identify gene targets responsible for this phenomenon. We used Affymetrix microarrays to identify genes that are differentially regulated in SDEC vs. non-supportive cell lines.  The goal is to determine which genes maybe be contributing to human embryonic stem cell growth in the absence of a mouse fibroblast feeder layer.
