TITLE
Total RNA sequencing of APC mutant and wt colonic organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report elevated expression levels of genes involved in colon cancer in samples that carry mutations in the APC gene. Mutated skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed to iPSCs and then differentiated to colonigc organoids, where the total RNA was extracted from.

DESIGN
Comparison of the expression profiles of APC mutant and WT colonic organoids
