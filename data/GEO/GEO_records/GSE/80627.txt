TITLE
Effect of maple syrup extract high on the liver of mice fed a high-fat diet [II]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effects of the administration of maple syrup extract (MSXH) on hepatic gene expression were investigated in mice fed high-fat diet.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6J mice aged 3 weeks were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan) and housed in a room maintained at 21 ± 1°C and 50 ± 10% relative humidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle (light 08:00–20:00; dark 20:00–08:00). Mice were preliminary fed a low-fat diet (LFD) which contained fat at 10 kcal% for acclimation.  After a week of acclimation, mice were divided four groups (n=10 each) and fed for 4 weeks on diet which contained fat at 45 kcal% as high-fat diet (HFD), 45 kcal% plus 0.02% MSXH (002MSXH), 45 kcal% plus 0.05% MSXH (005MSXH), and LFD .  Mice were given a diet and water for 24 h ad libitum. On day 30th after 16 h fasted, animals were euthanized under anesthesia to excise the livers and to collect the blood.
