TITLE
miRNA expression data in tooth germs at embryonic day 11, 12, 14, and 16

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs are not well known their expression and function in tooth development. To identify the miRNAs expression during tooth development, tooth germs were dissected from the initiation bud, cap and bell stages.

DESIGN
miRNA-chip expression analysis was performed with RNAs of the molar tooth germs from embryos of pregnant mice at emrbryonic day 11, 12, 14, and 16, using Agilent's miRNA microarray.
