TITLE
Gene expression between high and low altitude Mus musculus domesticus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles is an attractive method for discovering how animals respond to environmental challenges in nature. Compared to low altitudes, high altitudes are characterized by reduced partial pressures of oxygen (hypoxia) and cooler ambient temperatures To better understand how mammals cope with high altitudes, we trapped wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from 3 populations in La Paz, Bolivia (3000 - 3600 m) and 3 populations in Lima, Peru (0 – 200 m). Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays were use to measure mRNA abundance in the livers of these mice.
