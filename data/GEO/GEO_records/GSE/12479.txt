TITLE
Transcriptional changes due to the [GAR+] prion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison between [gar-] and [GAR+] samples of the W303 background grown in 2% glucose.

DESIGN
Three separate [gar-] and [GAR+] cultures were grown to late exponential phase (OD600~0.8) prior to phenol-chloroform extraction.  Biological replicates are [gar-] samples #1, 2, and 3 and [GAR+] samples #1, 2, and 3.  [gar-] and [GAR+] sample sets were compared to determine transcriptional differences.
