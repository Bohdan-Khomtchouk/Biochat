TITLE
Colon cancer progression-polysomal difference

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two colon cancer cell lines are under study. SW480 and SW620. The first one is derived from primary cancer, SW620 are from lymphnode metastatic sites. they both comes from the sampe patient. Polisomal RNA fractions from the two isogenic colon cancer cells lines was purified by sucrose gradient and hybridized on affymetrix hgu133a chips. this study is complementary to the series  GSE1323 were total RNA was used instead. Comparison between the polysomal fraction chips and the total RNA chips is performed and the analysis proposed in a paper from the authors (at the moment in preparation). Keywords: other
