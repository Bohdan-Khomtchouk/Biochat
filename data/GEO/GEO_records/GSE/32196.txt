TITLE
nup42-delta cells pretreated with NaCl lose the altered gene expression in response to H2O2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
BY4741 (S288c haploid) cells have different gene expression in response to 0.4mM H2O2 when pretreated with 0.7M NaCl compared to cells that are not pretreated with NaCl (mock cells). Cells lacking Nup42p do not exhibit a different gene expression in response to H2O2 between naive cells and cells pretreated with 0.7M NaCl

DESIGN
BY4741 and nup42-delta cells were independently grown in log phase for at least 7 doublings (T0) and then the genomic expression of " mock " cells to 0.4mM H2O2 was assessed every 10 mins for 20 mins. To study the effects of NaCl treatment on H2O2 response, cells were grown in log phase at least 7 doublings (T0) and then the genomic expression of cells was measured in response to 0.7M NaCl at 30 mins and the treatment continued for 60 minutes. The cells were then removed from stress and grown in stress free media for four hours (memory t0). Then these cells were exposed to 0.4mM H2O2 and the genomic expression was measured every 10 minutes during the H2O2 timecourse of 20 minutes.
