TITLE
Identification of genes involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of berberine in DNP-activated mouse MC/9 mast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, extensive pruritus and a clinical course of symptomatic flares and remissions. Berberine (BER), a naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloid, has many pharmacological effects including inhibition of protein synthesis, cell cycle arrest, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, a detailed molecular mechanism underling the anti-inflammatory action of BER in inflammatory cells is unclear. Here, to identify genes involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of BER in DNP-activated mouse MC/9 mast cells, global-scale gene expression analysis was carried out using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
Mouse MC/9 mast cells were treated with BER (10 microM), DNP (anti-DNP IgE, Sigma; 500 microg/ml) or a combination of BER and DNP. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
