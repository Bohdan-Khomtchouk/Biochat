TITLE
Expression data from undifferentiated human ES cell line, khES3, grown using complete or methionine deprived media and ES cell derived endoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In undifferentiated human ES cells, 5hr Met deprivation (delta Met) led to decreased proliferation, and prolonged 24hr Met deprivation resulted in G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest, which then led to apoptosis. We used microarrays to detail the molecular mechanism of cell-death caused by Met deprivation in undifferentiated ES cells and checked the difference of Met cycle relate gene expression between undifferentiated human ES cells and ES cell derived endoderm.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested at undifferentiated or differentiated stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed gene expression profiles of undifferentiated khES3 cells cultured in complete (compl) or Met-deprived conditions (deltaMet) for 5 or 24 hr.  And 0hr untreated cells and endoderm cells were used as a comparison
