TITLE
Non-radiated and Radiated lymphocytes from breast cancer patients treated with high-dose hyperfractioned radiotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between gene expression profiles of ex vivo 2 Gy radiated lymphocytes and the development of acute and late toxicity due to hyperfractionated dose-escalation radiation therapy schedule in patientes with advanced breast cancer.  The gene expression profiles of ex vivo non-radiated lymphocytes were also examined. Keywords: Toxicity grade analysis.

DESIGN
Twelve patients were analyzed. No replicates of each patient was assesed. Human RNA universal control (Stratagene) was used as reference.
