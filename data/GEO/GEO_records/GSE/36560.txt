TITLE
smRNA under high osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identifiy osmotic stress responsive smRNAs, we used a deep-sequencing technique to profile small RNA populations in leaf and root tissues of plants under high osmotic stress and control conditions.

DESIGN
We treated 30day-old plants with high osmotic stress and sampled leaves and roots from the same plant with 3 biologial replicates. Then, 3 replicates were pooled and total RNA was extracted and prepared for smRNA deep sequencing. After normalization and annotation, we selected potential osmotic stress responsive smRNAs.
