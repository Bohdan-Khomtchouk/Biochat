TITLE
Expression data from 23 breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was conducted on RNA from 23 breast cancer cell lines to identify genes whose expression level correlates with sensitivity of particular drug Keywords: comparison of sensitive group versus resistant group of cell lines to particular drug

DESIGN
Baseline gene expression profiling was performed using 23 breast cancer cell lines to identify genomic signatures highly correlated with in vitro sensitivity to a particular drug
