TITLE
Expression profiling of transgenic Drosophila: neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Drosophila neurons visualized with transgenic reporter genes, 7.4 kb Cha-Gal:UAS-GFP or 2.1 kb Gad1(s)-RFP. Keywords: neuronal cell type comparison

DESIGN
Transgenic Drosophila embryo cultures (5-7 day old) incubated at 25 C, dissociated and harvested for Fluorescent Active Cell Sorting (FACS) prior to microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
