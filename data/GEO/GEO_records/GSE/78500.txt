TITLE
Comparative expression data between ANGPTL4+/+ and ANGPTL4-/- mice whole colon tissue during DSS or SA-induced inflammation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Protracted inflammatory responses are signatures common to many gastrointestinal disorders. Severe and chronic disorders often bring about extensive tissue damage, in turn leading to hypercytokinemia. Here, we show that stimuli like dextran sulphate sodium salt (DSS) and stearic acid (SA) cause acute colonic inflammation, and ANGPTL4 is an important regulator in mediating the extent of colonic inflammation. Using comparative microarray gene expression analysis, we seek to identify genes whose expression are altered during inflammation between ANGPTL4+/+ and ANGPTL4-/- mice.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice were kept on 5% DSS in (drinking water) or 15% SA (in ground maintenance-diet chow) for 8 days and fresh whole colon tissues were harvested. RNA was extracted with Trizol® (Thermo Scientific)  in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA samples were later processed using Applause® WT-Amp ST System (NuGEN), and subsequent microarray experiments were performed using GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
