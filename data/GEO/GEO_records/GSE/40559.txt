TITLE
Gene expression profiles of 5 cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of 5 cancer cell lines, including lung cancer (SBC-5 (duplicate samples), ACC-LC319/bone2, NCI-H1048); and breast cancer (ZR75.1, HCC1397) were analyzed.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured following the guidelines published somewhere, and at confluent ~ 80% cells were extracted RNA for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
