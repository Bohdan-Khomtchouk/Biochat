TITLE
Evaluation of a Low Density DNA Microarray for Small B-Cell non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Differential Diagnosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphomas are classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification which defines subtypes on the basis of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic criteria. Using this model, 8 of 9 of the validation samples were classified successfully. This pilot study demonstrates that such a microarray tool may be a promising diagnostic approach for small B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Keywords: Small B-Cell non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, Low Density DNA Microarray, Diagnosis
