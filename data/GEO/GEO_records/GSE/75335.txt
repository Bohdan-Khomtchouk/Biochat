TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of genome-wide binding sites of hnRNP U in BNL CL.2 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The aim of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of hnRNP U binding site. Methods: The chromatin of BNL CL.2 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP U(Abcam) and normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). The immunoprecipitated DNA was then subjected to various previously constructed sequencing libraries. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2500. All reads were aligned to the mm9 genome browser using the bowtie with default parameters. Results: A total number of 12249 peaks that specifically binded by hnRNP U was obtained. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of genome-wide binding sites of hnRNP U generated by ChIP-seq technology.

DESIGN
hnRNP U binding profiling in Mus musculus fetal liver cell line BNL CL.2 cells, and the IgG antibody was used as a negative control
