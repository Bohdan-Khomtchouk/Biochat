TITLE
Comparison of TLR4-stimulated mouse microglia from wildtype and CD14ko strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The analysis reveals the importance of CD14 in microglial responses to pathogen- and damage-associated  molecular patterns, based on stimulations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fiibronectin (FN). The data show a dose- and agonist-dependent involvement of CD14. Lack of CD14 impairs responses to low-dose challenegs with LPS, whereas high-dose challenegs are affected to a much lesser degree. For FN, CD14 deficiency causes a major impairment of the response capacity.

DESIGN
Mouse microglia from wt and cd14-/- strains were stimulated with 0.1 and 10 ng/ml of LPS or with 100 Âµg/ml of mouse FN for 3 h. Untreated cells served as the controls. Each condition was based on three independent cell preparations as wells a processing.
