TITLE
Gene expression in aortic roots of wild type versus klotho-deficient mice at 6 weeks of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Klotho-deficient mice develop aortic valve annulus calcification by 6 weeks of age. Understanding the molecular basis by which aortic valve calcification is initiated will help define potential molecular targets which may be inhibited to reduce or prevent aortic valve calcification. Changes in gene expression related to aortic valve annulus calcification were analyzed by comparing gene expression in the aortic roots from wild type versus klotho-deficient mice.

DESIGN
Aortic roots, containing the aortic valve, valve annulus, and a portion of the ascending aorta were harvested from klotho-deficient and wild type mice at 6 weeks of age and analyzed by Affymetrix microarray.
