TITLE
RNA sequencing of B cell subsets (CD11c hi IgD+ B cells, CD11c hi IgD- B cells, Memory B cells and Na√Øve B cells) from healthy subjects and subjects with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD11c+ B cells (IgD+ and IgD-) are pathogenic B cells expanded in autoimmune disease. The purpose of this study is to identify the pathways unique to IgD+ CD11c B cells and IgD- CD11c B cells.

DESIGN
B cell subsets were isolated from peripheral blood and RNA sequencing was performed with Hiseq 2000 platform

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
