TITLE
Genome wide analysis of gene expression in LPS stimulated splenic B cell.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of class switch recombination, maturation or differenciation of B cells at gene expression levels. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that TLR signaling in B cells plays an pivotal role for class switch, maturation and differenciation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured splenic B cells. Gene expression compared between control and cKO B cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
