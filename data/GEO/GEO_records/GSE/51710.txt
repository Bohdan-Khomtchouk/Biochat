TITLE
Microarray data from aerial tissue of Williams 82 soybean exposed to submergence and reoxygenation

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Submergence is a major constraint for soybean production worldwide and transient inundation after seeding causes serious loss of soybean productivity. To characterize genome-scale adjustment of gene expression to submergence and reoxygenation,  whole transcriptome analysis was conducted using Affymetrix Soybean Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.

DESIGN
Aerial tissue of soybean which were treated with 1 d submergence, 5 d submergence, and 5 d submergence + 1 d reoxygenation were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (Soybean Gene 1.0 ST arrays). Non-submerged were used as control. Two independent biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment.
