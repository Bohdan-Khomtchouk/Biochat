TITLE
Med23-dependent gene expression programs in T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analysis TCR induced Med23-dependent gene expression programs in T cells, we have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to be regulated by Med23 in unstimulated or stimulated T cells. Mice CD4 T cells from wildtype and Med23 knockout mice were left unstimulated or stimulated for 6 hr, and gene expression difference was identified among four samples. Expression of seven genes (Med23, IFNg, IL2, Egr2, c-Fos, c-Jun and Foxp1) was validated in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
TCR induced Med23-dependent gene expression was measured after unstimulation or stimulation for 6 hr in wildtype and Med23 knockout CD4 T cells.
