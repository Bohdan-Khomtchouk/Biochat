TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 6 hours post fertilization mecp2-null versus wild type zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was performed on RNA isolated from groups of 6 hpf wild type and mecp2-null embryos (n=3 biological replicates per condition with 30 embryos pooled per replicate). DESeq2 analysis was performed using https://usegalaxy.org/

DESIGN
Whole embryo mRNA profile of 30 pooled mecp2-null or wild type 6 hpf zebrafish embryos, in triplicate, using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform

PLATFORM
GPL21741 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Danio rerio)
