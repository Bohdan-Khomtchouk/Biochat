TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of BES1 binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important regulators for plant growth and development. BRs signal to control the activities of the BES1 and BZR1 family transcription factors. In order to further understand the mechanism by which BES1/BZR1 regulates downstream genes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) to identify BES1 binding sites in the genome. By combining ChIP-chip data with gene expression microarray data, we are able to discover genes that are directly regulated by BES1 (i.e. BES1 target genes).

DESIGN
Chromatin from bes1-D Arabidopsis seedlings are immunoprecipitated by anti-BES1 antibody with anti-GFP antibody as control.
