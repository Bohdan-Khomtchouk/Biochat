TITLE
Expression data from CD34+/CD71- cells following knockdown of HSPA9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of HSPA9 causes a dose-dependent decrease in erythroid maturation of CD34+ cells differentiated in culture. Due to differences in the degree of differentiation, a more homogeneous population was selected for using FACS and the gene expression profile of these cells was compared. We used a lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting either luciferase (control shLUC) or HSPA9 (shHSPA9-433) to knock down expression of HSPA9.

DESIGN
We isolated CD34+ cells from human cord blood (Day 0), transduced cells with a lentiviral vector (Day 1), selected for transduced cells with puromycin and differentiated them in erythroid culture media before FACS isolation of the CD34+/CD71- population (Day 5). Four independent CD34+ populations were isolated, differentiated and sorted for biologic replicates.
