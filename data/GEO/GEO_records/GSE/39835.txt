TITLE
A Novel Osteoclastic Network Determines Niche for Mouse Hematopoietic Stem Cells In Vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The importance of extrinsic regulation of hematopoietic stem cell activity is increasingly acknowledged. Here we report the generation of a new niche system, which supports expansion of mouse hematopoietic stem cells in vitro. Characterization of this niche revealed a transcriptional regulatory network including four critical factors, namely FOS, SPI1, KLF10 and TFEC. Interestingly, these factors are essential for osteoclastogenesis, thus revealing an osteoclastic network that supports hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal.

DESIGN
Lentiviral vectors containing putative transcription factors regulating HSC expansion were transfected into GPE cells and gene expression values were compared to empty vector controls.
