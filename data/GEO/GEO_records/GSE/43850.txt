Gene expression profiles of induced multipotent germline stem cells and other pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have pluripotent potential. However, frequency of pluripotent cell derivation is low and the mechanism of culture-induced reprogramming remains unknown. Here we report that epigenetic instability of germline stem (GS) cells, cultured SSCs, induces pluripotent cell derivation. GS cells undergo DNA demethylation in H19 differentially methylated region under low-density culture. When H19 demethylation was induced by Dnmt1 depletion, they converted into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells. Dnmt1 depletion downregulated Dmrt1 expression, whose depletion also induced pluripotency. Functional screening of Dmrt1 target gene revealed that Dmrt1 depletion upregulates Sox2, the key molecule responsible for generating induced pluripotent stem cells. Although Sox2 transfection upregulated Oct4 and produced pluripotent cells, this conversion was inhibited by Oct1 overexpression, suggesting that the balance of Oct proteins maintains SSC identity. These results suggest that culture-induced reprogramming is caused by unstable DNA methylation, and that Dmrt1-Sox2 cascade is critical for regulating pluripotency in SSCs.

DESIGN
Pluripotent stem-like cells were induced from GS cells by down-regulation of  Dnmt/Dmrt, or up-regulation of Sox2/Oct4 in combination with p53 knock-down and their total RNA samples were subjected to microarray analysis to compare their gene expression profile with other pluripotent stem cells such as ES cells or iPS cells.
