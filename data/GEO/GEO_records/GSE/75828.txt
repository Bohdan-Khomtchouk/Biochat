TITLE
HAL2 overexpression induces iron acquisition and enhanced salt resistance in bdf1Δ

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The strain bdf1Δ+HAL2 improved salt resistance of bdf1∆. To gain further insight into the mechanism of bdf1∆ salt sensitivity, DNA microarray analysis was performed to determine the reason for the salt sensitivity of bdf1∆ cells and the process of how HAL2 overexpression and HDA1 deletion improves salt resistance. Transcriptomic analysis under salt treatment (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min) was performed using four different strains: bdf1∆,  W303, bdf1Δ+HAL2 and bdf1∆hda1∆. The transcription of 1,393 genes were significantly changed( > 2-fold) in bdf1∆ compared with W303 upon NaCl stress (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min). Only 108 genes were significantly changed ( > 2-fold) in bdf1Δ+HAL2 compared with bdf1∆ upon NaCl stress (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min).  Only 88 genes were significantly changed ( > 2-fold) in bdf1Δ+HAL2 compared with bdf1∆ upon NaCl stress (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min).

DESIGN
bdf1∆ vs W303 upon NaCl stress (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min);bdf1Δ+HAL2 vs bdf1Δ under salt treatment (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min); bdf1Δhda1Δ vs bdf1Δ under salt treatment (0.5 mol.L-1 NaCl for 45 min).
