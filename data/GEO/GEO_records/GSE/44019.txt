TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for metastatic melanoma specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between the copy number of differentially methylated sites between lymph node metastasis from melanoma patients with good prognosis and melanoma brain metastasis. All samples are taken from different patients, and were established as cell lines in the John Wayne Cancer Institute.

DESIGN
Sixteen metastatic melanomas were run on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Lymph node metastases and brain metastases genetic copy number variations were compared.
