TITLE
DIRECT CONVERSION OF FIBROBLASTS INTO FUNCTIONAL ASTROCYTES BY DEFINED TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Direct cell reprogramming has enabled the direct conversion of skin fibroblasts into functional neurons and oligodendrocytes using a minimal set of cell lineage-specific transcription factors. This approach has substantial advantages since it is rapid and simple, generating the cell type of interest in a single step. However, it remains unknown whether this technology can be applied for directly reprogramming skin cells into astrocytes, the third neural lineage. Astrocytes play crucial roles in neuronal homeostasis and their dysfunctions contribute to the origin and progression of multiple human diseases. Herein, we carried out a screening using several transcription factors involved in defining the astroglial cell fate and identified NFIA, NFIB and SOX9 to be sufficient to convert with high efficiency embryonic and post-natal mouse fibroblasts into astrocytes (iAstrocytes). We proved both by gene expression profiling and functional tests that iAstrocytes are comparable to native brain astrocytes. This protocol can be then employed to generate functional iAstrocytes for a wide range of experimental applications.

DESIGN
Induced astrocytes (iAstro) were compared to Fibroblasts (Fibro) as negative control and to primary astrocytes (astro) as positive control. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.
