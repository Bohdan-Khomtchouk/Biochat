TITLE
A NOVEL EPIGENETIC SILENCING PATHWAY INVOLVING the HIGHLY CONSERVED 5'-3' EXORIBONUCLEASE Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2 in SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES POMBE [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Epigenetic gene silencing plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and contributes to organismal development and cell fate acquisition in eukaryotes. In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin-associated gene silencing is known to be mediated by RNA processing pathways including RNA interference (RNAi) and a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease complex exosome. Here, we report a new RNA-processing pathway that contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin mediated by 5’-3’ exoribonuclease Dhp1/Xrn2. Dhp1 mutation causes defective gene silencing both at peri-centromeric regions and at the silent mating type locus. Intriguingly, mutation of either one of two well-characterized Dhp1-interacting proteins, the Din1 pyrophosphohydrolase or the Rhn1 transcription termination factor, does not show silencing defects at the main heterochromatic regions. Dhp1 is essential in the sequential steps of establishing silencing in a manner independent of both RNAi and the exosome. Genomic and genetic analysis suggest that Dhp1 is involved in post-transcriptional silencing of repetitive regions through its catalytic activity. Our study is the first investigation into an unexpected role of Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2 in chromatin-based silencing. These results elucidate how various RNA-processing pathways, acting together or independently, contribute to epigenetic regulation of the eukaryotic genome.

DESIGN
Dhp1-1 was performed twice in biological replicates, din1∆ once.
