TITLE
Comparison between mouse hepatocytes derived from wt and YAP transgenic livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary isolated hepatocytes derived from wildtype mice are compared with hepatocytes isolated from YAP(S127A) transgenic mice (Tschaharganeh at al., 2013 Gastroenterology, PMID 23419361). YAP induction was done for 8 weeks and livers showed hyperplasia without signs of malignant transformation.

DESIGN
Three independent wildtype mice are compared with three independent YAP transgenics.
