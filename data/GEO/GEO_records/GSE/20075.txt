TITLE
Molecular signatures of mucosal immunity that distinguish HIV controllers from non-controllers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV “controllers” are individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV) who maintain long-term control of viremia without antiviral therapy and who usually do not develop the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In this study, we have used oligonucleotide expression arrays to characterize the mucosal immune responses of these subjects in relation to untreated HIV+ individuals with high viral loads and progressive disease (“non-controllers”). Recto-sigmoid biopsies were analyzed from 9 controllers and 11 non-controllers. All of the genes identified to be significantly different were more highly expressed in the non-controllers. Many of these genes are involved in immunity and defence. These results underscore the importance of the sustained inflammatory response that attends progressive HIV disease. Keywords: Recto-sigmoid biopsy profiles from HIV infected individuals

DESIGN
We analyzed a series of 20 HEEBO arrays on which were hybed RNA amplified from the recto-sigmoid biopsies of HIV infected individuals that either have progressive disease or can maintain long term control of viremia.
