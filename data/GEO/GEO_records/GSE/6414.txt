TITLE
Expression data from soybean seed compartments with embryos at the globular stage

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We microdissected each compartment from 6-micron paraffin sections using the Leica AS LMD system to identify all genes active in different compartments of a soybean seed containing globular-stage embryos. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Globular-stage seed compartments were isolated using the Leica AS LMD system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix Soybean Genome Arrays.
