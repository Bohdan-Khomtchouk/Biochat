TITLE
Global DNA Methylation Remodeling Accompanies CD8 T Cell Effector Function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In response to acute infection CD8 T cells differentiate into effector cells capable of clearing the antigen.  While the transcriptional and functional changes have previously been studied little is known of the epigenetic modifications that accompany this differentiation process.  To gain insights into CD8 T cell effector differentiation and the role of epigenetics, we mapped DNA methylation by MeDIP-seq in naive CD8 T cells and day 8 effector CD8 T cells that are induced following an acute infection.  We identified hundreds of thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs).  Promoter DNA methylation inversely correlated with gene expression and DMRs were enriched for functional transcription factor binding sites.  These data indicated that DNA methylation is dynamic during CD8 T cell differentiation and provide a map of possible regulatory regions important in this process.
