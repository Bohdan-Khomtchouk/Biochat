TITLE
Robust Differentiation of Islet Progenitors into Functional Insulin-secreting Cells by Suppression of Key Transcription Regulators

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene profiling revealed that differentiation was accompanied by suppression of a range of transcription regulator genes typical of islet progenitor cells.  In order to understand molecular mechanisms of differentiation, transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on purified islet progenitors  at days 0, 1 and 4 of differentiation together with adult islets as a control.
