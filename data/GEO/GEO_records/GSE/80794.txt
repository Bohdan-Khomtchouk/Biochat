TITLE
Stilbenoids remodel the DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer cells and inhibit oncogenic NOTCH signaling through epigenetic regulation of MAML2 transcriptional activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of human breast cancer cell lines, lowly invasive MCF10CA1h and highly invasive MCF10CA1a, treated with vehicle control (ethanol) and with RSV (resveratrol). The Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in human cell lines exposed to described treatments. Samples included biological triplicate of MCF10CA1h control (ethanol treated), biological triplicate of MCF10CA1h treated with RSV, biological triplicate of MCF10CA1a control (ethanol treated), biological triplicate of MCF10CA1a treated with RSV.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
