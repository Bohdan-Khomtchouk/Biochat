TITLE
KYSE (450, 520, 890, 960) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profiles in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines

DESIGN
KYSE cell lines were maintained in Ham’s F-12/RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 ˚C in a fully-humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. According to manufacture’s instructions, 500 ng of total RNA was labeled with Hy5 and was hybridized on the Human miRNA Oligo chip for 16 hour at 32˚C. A Human miRNA Oligo chip was scanned using ProScanArray (PerkinElmer).
