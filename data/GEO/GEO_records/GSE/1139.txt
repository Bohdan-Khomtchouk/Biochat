TITLE
Expression profiling of fast glial cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of genes mediating glioma invasion promotes the understanding of glia motility and might result in biologically based therapeutic approaches. To evaluate migration mechanisms operating in vitro versus in vivo, we used C6 rat glioma cells for selecting highly migratory cells in a monolayer migration assay (C6) as well as in brains of nude mice (C6SPGFP), and analyzed in each paradigm the expression profiles of these " fast " cells versus those of the original " slow " cells.
