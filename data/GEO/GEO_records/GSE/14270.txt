TITLE
Central corneal thickness is a genetic dependent trait among inbred strains of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Central corneal thickness (CCT) exhibits broad variability.  We determined the corneal gene expression profile three mouse strains with distinct corneal thickness: C57BLKS/J (88.6 um), SJL/J (123.5 um), and C57BL/6J (100.1 um). Keywords: Strain comparison

DESIGN
Enucleated eyes from 4 month old mice were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and a punch of central cornea was collected utilizing a 2-mm biopsy punch. Two central corneal punches (left and right eyes) were pooled from each mouse to form one sample; three samples were analyzed per strain.
