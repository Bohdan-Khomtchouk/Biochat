TITLE
Central corneal thickness is a genetic dependent trait among inbred strains of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Central corneal thickness (CCT) exhibits broad variability.  We determined the corneal gene expression profile three mouse strains with distinct corneal thickness: C57BLKS/J (88.6 um), SJL/J (123.5 um), and C57BL/6J (100.1 um). Keywords: Strain comparison
