TITLE
Response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus, and candida albicans derived peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 1 healthy donor. The cells were stimulated with peptides derived from influenza virus H1 and H5, human cytomegalovirus, and candida albicans for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
