TITLE
Gene expression signature as a predictor of recurrence in stage II Colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have been attempting to stratify the stage II CRC patients into good or poor prognoses based on gene expression signatures of resected specimen. We collected more CRC stage II cases up to 300, and analyzed gene expression for those samples. We selected a set of 3,023 probes (1,978 genes) for extracting metastasis-related discriminator genes. These genes consisted of 491 prognosis related genes identical to the probes on another platform array, and other probes for hybridization and quality control. Using these 3,023 probes, we attempted to select discriminator genes, with the 150 training sample set, resulting 55 markers. We then applied the discriminator set to the second, 150 samples set in a blind test for predictive accuracy and prognostic validity. The multivariate Cox analyses showed the significant parameters to predict the prognosis with a hazard ratio of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.67; p=0.004). This personalized prognosis is crucial with CRC patients, the predictive performance may deserve serious consideration for possible application to clinic.

DESIGN
The study subjects were a total of 300 patients with advanced CRC who underwent curative surgery between 2003 and 2006 at the following institutions. The first set of patients consists of 150 cases, including 110 recurrent-free (follow-up median, 60 months) and 40 recurrent patients who underwent surgery before December 2004. This set of 150 cases was assigned to a retrospective training study. The second set consists of 150 cases in which curative surgery was undertaken after January 2005.
