TITLE
Six2GFPE15.5 110309

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes  regulated by Sall1 in the kidney.

DESIGN
Six2GFP-positive nephron progenitors and Six2GFP-negative cells were collected from the embryonic kidneys at E15.5  (2 set) , and their expression profiles were compared.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
