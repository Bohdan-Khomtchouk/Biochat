TITLE
Form deprivation modulates retinal neurogenesis in primate experimental myopia

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Juvenile primates develop myopia when their visual experience is degraded by lid fusion. In response to the abnormal visual input, retinal neural networks cause an excessive growth of the postequatorial segment of the eye, but the mechanism underlying this axial elongation is unknown. By combining analysis of gene expression, injection of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and immunocytochemistry, we show that the retinal periphery in both juvenile rhesus macaques and green monkeys harbors a population of mitotically active neuroprogenitor cells that proliferate when the visual experience is altered by lid fusion. Furthermore, the number of dividing cells is highly correlated with the axial elongation of the eye and the resulting myopic refractive error. Thus, the retina undergoes active growth during the postnatal development of the primate eye. This growth is modulated by the visual input and accelerates considerably when the eye develops axial myopia. Keywords: disease state analysis
