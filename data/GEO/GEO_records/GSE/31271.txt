TITLE
Control of Embryonic Stem Cell Lineage Commitment by Core Promoter Factor, TAF3 (RNA-Seq data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that TAF3, a TBP-associated core promoter factor, is highly enriched in ES cells. In addition to its role in the core promoter recognition complex TFIID, genome-wide binding studies reveal that TAF3 localizes to chromosomal regions bound by CTCF and cohesin. Enrichment for TAF3/CTCF/cohesin bound regions distinguishes TAF3-activated from TAF3-repressed genes. Our findings support a new role of TAF3 in mediating long-range chromatin regulatory interactions to safeguard the finely-balanced transcriptional programs that give rise to pluripotency.

DESIGN
Comparison of genome-wide expression patterns between TAF3-knockdown and WT embryonic stem cells using mRNA-Seq. Significantly differentially expressed protein-coding genes were identified by comparing control and knock-down samples at each timepoint (ES, embryoid body day 3 (EB3), EB6). Single and paired-end samples were combined at each timepoint, resulting in 3 tests for each gene (based on 8, 4, 4 independent measurements at ES ,EB3, EB6, respectively).
