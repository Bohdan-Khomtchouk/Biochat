TITLE
High resolution array-CGH and expression profiling identifies a novel genomic subtype of ER negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An oligo array based high-resolution analysis of copy number alterations in 171 primary breast tumors of relatively small size and low NPI, and 49 breast cancer cell-lines. Objectives of the study were to study the molecular taxonomy and the genomic aberration patterns in a breast cancer cohort representative of breast cancer demographics. Keywords: array comparative genomic hybridisation
