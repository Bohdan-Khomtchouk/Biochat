TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse HSPCs retrovirally transduced with Plzf

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously found the immortalization of mouse HSPCs retrovirally transuced with Plzf. To investigate the moleular mehcanism of the immortalization, we preliminarily performed comprehensive gene expression profiling of Plzf-transduced KSL and myeloid progenitor-enriched (MP) cells using cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
For screening of critical target genes involved in the immortalization, KSL and MP cells were retrovirally transduced with Plzf-IRES-EGFP or EGFP.  GFP-positive cells were sorted 48 hours after the transduction, followed by RNA extraction.  The Plzf-transduced cells were compared with the control  GFP-transduced cells.
