TITLE
Amyloid protein-mediated differential DNA methylation status regulates gene expression in Alzheimerâ€™s disease model cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of human neuroglioma cell line (H4) and the Swedish double mutant-harboring H4 cell line (H4-sw). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in 2 cell lines, H4 and H4-sw.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the H4 and H4-sw cells were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
