TITLE
p53 shapes genome-wide changes in small non-coding RNA expression during the human DNA damage response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small RNA-seq on MCF10A, HCT116 and HCT116p53-/- cell lines after induction of DNA damage (5 Gy Irradiation).

DESIGN
Small RNA-seq on MCF10A, HCT116 and HCT116p53-/- at 4 and 24 hours after induction of DNA damage (5 Gy Irradiation), done in duplicate with respective control (0 hour) using illumina Genome Analyzer IIx

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
