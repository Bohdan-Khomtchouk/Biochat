TITLE
Global mRNA expression profiling of patient derived pancreatic carcinoma xenograft Bo63 following JQ1-SAHA combination therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global mRNA expression profiling of patient derived pancreatic carcinoma xenograft Bo63 were collected using Agilent human whole genome array (G4845A AMADID 026652, cRNA 4x44k V2) . Two different sources of RNA were analyzed: 1.) Bo63 xenograft tumors grown on nude mice treated with vehicle only as control. 2.) Bo63 xenograft tumor grown on nude mice treated with JQ1 and SAHA (SAHA 25 mg/kg 1-0-0 and JQ1 50 mg/kg 0-0-1, treatment was imitated when tumor size reached 200 mm³ +/- 20 mm³.

DESIGN
Two conditions (vehicle vs JQ1-SAHA treatment), each condition is represented by 3-4 biological replicates
