TITLE
UC San Diego Friedmann Kang Neuronal Differentiation DSD3 SNM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression pattern of spherical neural masses (SNM) derived from HPRT knockdown murine D3 stem cells during neuronal differentiation to final neurons was invesitigated by RNA-Seq based gene expression analysis and the results were interpreted by GO, GSEA and signaling pathway analyses with Avadis NGS and PANTHER Classification System.

DESIGN
For RNA-Seq experiment, total RNAs of HPRT knockdown and control SNMs were extracted time-sequentially during the SNM differentiation such as differentiation-day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 to final neurons, and each prepared library applied to the HiSeq 2000 sequencer of Illumina for 50 cycles of single lane run.
