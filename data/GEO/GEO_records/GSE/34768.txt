TITLE
Genomic profiling of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization comparing splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) specimens with control DNA

DESIGN
A custom high-definition oligonucleotide microarray (4x44K, Agilent) was designed for aCGH from the online application tool eArray (version 5.3) and HD-CGH probe library (sequence source UCSC hg18 / NCBI Build 36). This custom microarray combines the capability to scan human genome-wide with an average resolution of approximately 100 Kb and to focus on regions of interest for highest resolution tiling (11 Kb-resolution for either chromosomes 3q and 7q). The array contains about 8,500 and 9,000 oligonucleotides spanning 97 Mb and 105 Mb of the 7q and the 3q chromosomes respectively. Twenty-seven SMZL specimens (9 males, 18 females) were analyzed using a dye-swap methodology to confirm the copy number variations. Two samples (one male, one female, namely M-CTRL and F-CTRL) collected from healthy volunteers blood from national Etablissement Fran√ßais du Sang were used as DNA reference for aCGH experiments.
