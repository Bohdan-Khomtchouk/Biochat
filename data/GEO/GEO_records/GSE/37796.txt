SUMMARY
We introduce a family of multivalent peptidomimetic conjugates that modulate the activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Bioactive ethisterone ligands were conjugated to a set of sequence-specific peptoid oligomers. Certain multivalent peptoid conjugates enhance AR-mediated transcriptional activation. We identify a linear and a cyclic conjugate that exhibit potent anti-proliferative activity in LNCaP-abl cells, a model of therapy-resistant prostate cancer. The linear conjugate blocks AR action by competing for ligand binding. In contrast, the cyclic conjugate is active despite its inability to compete against endogenous ligand for binding to AR in vitro, suggesting a non-competitive mode of action. These results establish a versatile platform to design competitive and non-competitive AR modulators with potential therapeutic significance. We use microarray analysis to further elucidate the mechanism of AR antagonism and show that the compounds (cyc and n=8) are distinct.

DESIGN
We used microarray analysis to see genone-wide effects on LNCaP-abl cells with moduators of AR activity LNCaP-abl cells were treated with compound and RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays Treatments: Vehicle is just Ethanol treated LNCaP-abl cells that were used as a control. n=8 and cyc are peptoid conjugates that modulate AR activity. n=8 is linear and cyc is a cyclic compounds.  We wanted to look at gene expression when LNCaP-abl cells were treated with these compounds to show that they are distinct. C3 is a small molecule that inhibits the interaction between AR and beta-catenin (co-regulator protein). Initial results with this compound show potent anti-proliferative activity in LNCaP-abl cells and we wanted to further investigate the mechanism of action of this compound.
