TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving intramuscular Interferon-beta-1a therapy [U133 A and B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the transcriptional effects induced by intramuscular IFN-beta-1a treatment (Avonex, 30 Âµg once weekly) in patients with relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). By using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we obtained genome-wide expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 24 MS patients within the first four weeks of IFN-beta administration. Keywords: Multiple sclerosis, Interferon, Pharmacogenomics, Affymetrix

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first, second and fifth IFN-beta injection. Total RNA of Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 A and B arrays to quantify the mRNA levels.
