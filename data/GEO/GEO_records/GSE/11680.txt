TITLE
Gene expression differences between high and low exploratory genetically identical mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetically identical inbred mice exhibit substantial stable individual variability in exploratory behavior.  We used microarrays to look at gene expression differences in the hippocampus in female mice separated by stable differences in exploratory behavior
