TITLE
Alternative splicing and gene expression in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Distinct RNA-mediated impacts on alternative splicing and extracellular matrix gene expression in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is associated with expression of expanded CTG DNA repeats as RNA (CUGexp RNA). To test whether CUGexp RNA creates a global splicing defect, we compared skeletal muscle of two mouse DM1 models, one expressing a CTGexp transgene, and another homozygous for a defective Mbnl1 gene.  Strong correlation in splicing changes for ~100 new Mbnl1-regulated exons indicates loss of Mbnl1 explains > 80% of the splicing pathology due to CUGexp RNA.  In contrast, only about half of mRNA level changes can be attributed to loss of Mbnl1, indicating CUGexp RNA has Mbnl1-independent effects, particularly on mRNAs for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  We propose that CUGexp RNA causes two separate effects: loss of Mbnl1 function, disrupting splicing, and loss of another function that disrupts ECM mRNA regulation, possibly mediated by MBNL2.  These findings reveal unanticipated similarities between DM1 and other muscular dystrophies.

DESIGN
MBNL1 knockout and HSALR mice on FVB background. To test whether CUGexp RNA creates a global splicing defect, we compared skeletal muscle of two mouse DM1 models, one expressing a CTGexp transgene, and another homozygous for a defective Mbnl1 gene. These samples were compared to the skeletal muscle of a wildtype mouse.
