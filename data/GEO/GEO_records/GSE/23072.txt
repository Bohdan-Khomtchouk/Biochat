TITLE
Estrogen response uterine gene profile in Ex3Î±ERKO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT and Ex3aERKO females were ovariectomized and injected with saline or estradiol. Uterine tissue was collected after 2 or 24 hours. RNA was analyzed by microarray to determine if the Ex3aERKO mice would lack the residual transcritpional resposnes seen in the previous aERKO model.

DESIGN
3 uteri per group were analyzed individually on one-color Agilent arrays. Comparisons were made within ERa genotype (WT saline to WT E treated; Ex3aERKO saline to Ex3aERKO E treated)
