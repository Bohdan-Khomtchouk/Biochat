TITLE
Gene expression profile of human monocytes stimulated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1,25a-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A role for vitamin A in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been suggested through epidemiological and in vitro studies; however, the antimicrobial mechanism is unclear.  Here, we demonstrate that vitamin A mediates host defense through regulation of cellular cholesterol content.  Comparison of monocytes stimulated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active forms of vitamin A and vitamin D respectively, indicates that ATRA and 1,25D3 induce mechanistically distinct antimicrobial activities.  Gene expression profiling reveals that ATRA but not 1,25D3 triggers a lipid metabolism and efflux pathway, including expression of lysosomal lipid transport gene NPC2.  ATRA-induced decrease in total cellular cholesterol content, subcellular lipid reorganization, lysosomal acidification and antimicrobial activity are all dependent upon expression of NPC2.  Finally, the addition of HIV-protease inhibitors known to inhibit cholesterol efflux, Ritonavir and Nelfinavir, blocked both ATRA-induced cholesterol decrease as well as antimicrobial activity.  Taken together, these results suggest that the vitamin A-mediated host defense mechanism against M. tuberculosis requires regulation of cellular cholesterol.

DESIGN
Monocytes derived from four independent healthy blood donors that were stimulated with control (CTRL), ATRA or 1,25D3 at 10-8M for 18 hours.
