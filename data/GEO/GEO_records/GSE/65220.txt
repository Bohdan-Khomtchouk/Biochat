TITLE
Microarray analysis among non-alcoholic fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) has the potential to progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or to promote type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, NASH and T2DM do not always develop coordinately. We established rat models of NAFL, NASH, and NAFL + T2DM to recapitulate different phenotypes associated with NAFLD and its progression. Microarrays were used to identify hepatic gene expression changes in each of these models. The goal is to identify a predictor of different NAFLD progressions. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as a low-grade systemic inflammatory state with both hepatic and extra-hepatic manifestations. We aimed to identify common key regulators and adaptive pathways in different NAFLD phenotypes. NAFL, NASH and NAFL+T2DM rat models were used to represent simple fatty liver, fatty liver with severe hepatic manifestations, and fatty liver with severe metabolic manifestations, respectively. We applied microarray analysis to characterize the key regulators and adaptive pathways in different NAFLD phenotypes.

DESIGN
There are 12 samples in our study which belonged to 4 groups, and each group contains 3 different samples.
