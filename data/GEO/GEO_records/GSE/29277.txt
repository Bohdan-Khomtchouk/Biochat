TITLE
Conversion of Mouse Fibroblasts to Sphere Cells with Differentiation Potential Induced by AlbuMAXI-containing Medium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels during Fibroblast to sphere cell conversion induced by albumax I containing medium. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) can be converted to sphere cells in the presence of arachidonic acid and pluronic - F 68. The converted cells exhibit stem cell like properties and and have the potential to differentiate into all the three embryonic germ layers. Our results provide important information on genes that are up- or down-regulated during the reprogramming/conversion process.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from murine embryonic fibroblasts, normal mouse embryonic stem (MES) cells and converted sphere cells. MES cells were taken as a control/reference population. Three replicated were included for each sample.
