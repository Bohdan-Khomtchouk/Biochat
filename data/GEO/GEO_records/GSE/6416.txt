TITLE
Toxicogenomic responses in rainbow trout hepatocytes exposed to model chemicals and a synthetic mixture

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression of exposed versus non-exposed Oncorhynchus mykiss hepatocytes to four model chemicals and a synthetic mixture.  Hepatocytes were exposed for 24 hours to a single chemical and a synthetic mixture of 10 nM 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 0.75 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-di-benzodioxin (TCDD), 100 μM paraquat and 0.75 μM 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO). Keywords: Exposed vs. control

DESIGN
Four biological replicates for both exposed and non-exposed Oncorhynchus mykiss hepatocytes with corresponding dye flips.
