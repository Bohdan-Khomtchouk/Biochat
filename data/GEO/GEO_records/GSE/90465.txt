TITLE
Expression data from two weeks old Arabidopsis wild-type (Columbia-0) and lcbk1-2 knock-out mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray assays can facilitate elucidation of cellular processes and gene network functions in the processes of plant growth and development. To gain further insight into the potential molecular role of the LCBK1 gene in the freezing tolerance of plant, we performed Affymetrix whole-genome microarray analysis ( http://www.affymetrix.com/ ) on WT and lcbk1-2 plants to compare their genome-wide expression profiles under 22 °C or 4 °C treatment. The differently expressed genes revealed by transcriptional profiling indicate that LCBK1 may participate in the maintenance of plant ROS homeostasis and acts as a novel positive regulator of CBF-independent pathway to control the freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted using the Plant RNA Prep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from 2-week-old seedlings of the wild-type and lcbk1-2 grown on 1/2 MS medium containing 2% sucrose at 22˚C or 4˚C treatment for 3hr and 24hr under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod at 100 μmol m–2 s–1. 6μg of total RNA was used to synthesize biotin-labeled cDNA, which was then hybridized with the ATH1 oligonucleotide chips as instructed by the manufacturer (Affymetrix).
