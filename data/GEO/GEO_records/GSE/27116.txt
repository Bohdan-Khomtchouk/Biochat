TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of mouse embryonic stem cells-derived hematopoietic progenitors compared to native hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of c-kit+Sca-1+ cells generated in vitro from mouse ESCs using static and bioreactor-based cultures with native HSCs isolated from mouse fetal liver (FL) or bone marrow (BM).

DESIGN
total RNA obtained from ckit+Sca-1+ cells isolated  from mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) differentiated for 7 days in Static, Spinner flask and Synthecon compared to RNA isolated from ckit+Sca-1+ cells from mouse bone marrow, mouse fetal liver and mouse ES cells undifferentiated.
