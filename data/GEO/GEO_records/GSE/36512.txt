TITLE
H3K9/14Ac in TC-797 genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal is to localize " active " histone marks known to bind BRD4-NUT in the NMC genome.  Characterization of the reference epigenome in humans by use of ChIP-Seq in the TC-797 human NMC cell line.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of untreated TC-797 cells using H3K9/14Ac antibodies versus IgG control.

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
