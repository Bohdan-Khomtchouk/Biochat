TITLE
Setaria viridis (A10.1) circadian expression after light or temperature entrainment

ORGANISM
Setaria viridis

SUMMARY
Setaria viridis (A10.1) circadian expression after light or temperature entrainment

DESIGN
Plants were grown under either 12 hour photocycles (12h light/12h dark) or 12 hour thermocycles (12h 32 deg C/ 12h 22 deg C) then sampled every 2 hours for 48 hours under constant light and constant temperature conditions (32 deg C). Photocycle entrained samples are labeled LDHH-F, and thermocycle entrained samples are entrained LLHC-F.
