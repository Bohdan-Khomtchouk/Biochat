TITLE
microRNA expression profile in HEK293T cells infected with Chikungunya virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293T grown in 6 well plates were infected with CHIKV and total RNA was isolated from cells at 0, 12 and 24 hrs post infection. CHIKV microRNA expression signature was generated.

DESIGN
Cells grown on 6-well plates. Three biological replicates of uninfected and two biological replicates of infected samples

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
