TITLE
microRNA expression profile in HEK293T cells infected with Chikungunya virus

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
HEK293T grown in 6 well plates were infected with CHIKV and total RNA was isolated from cells at 0, 12 and 24 hrs post infection. CHIKV microRNA expression signature was generated.
