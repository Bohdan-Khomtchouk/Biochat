TITLE
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2745c Plays an Important Role in Responding to Redox Stress

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551

SUMMARY
The Rv2745c (clgR) gene encodes a Clp protease gene regulator that is induced in response to a variety of stress conditions and potentially plays a role in Mtb pathogenesis. The isogenic Mtb:ΔRv2745c mutant is significantly more sensitive to in vitro redox stress generated by diamide, relative to wild-type Mtb, implicating a role for ClgR in the management of intraphagosomal redox stress. Redox stress led to dysregulation of the σH regulon in the isogenic mutant, Mtb:ΔRv2745c. Induction of clgR in Mtb and Mtb:ΔRv2745c (comp) did not lead to Clp protease induction, indicating that clgR has additional functions that need to be elucidated. Disruption of genes involved in sulfate assimilation also occurred in the knock out, implicating clgR as a possible regulator of downstream signaling cascades that facilitate Mtb survival.

DESIGN
At different time points, (30, 60 and 90 mins, t=30, t=60 and t=90) following the addition of diamide to M. tuberculosis CDC1551 cultures, RNA was extracted and labeled with Cy5. RNA was also extracted from pre-diamide addition (t=0) time points and labeled with Cy3. These samples were cohybridized on M. tuberculosis CDC1551 whole genome microarrays using biological triplicate samples (i.e. samples derived from three distinct cultures and treatments) and thus three unique datasets were generated for each of the three time points for Mtb. Similar experiments were performed for an isogenic Rv2745c (clgR) mutant in Mtb CDC1551 which was generated by allelic exchange and a complemented strain which was generated by trans-complementation of Rv2745c in the attB locus of the mutant strain, thus restoring the wild type regulation of Rv2745c.
