TITLE
Gene expression responses to a Salmonella infection in the chicken intestine differ between lines.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Poultry products are an important source of Salmonella enterica. An effective way to reduce food poisoning due to Salmonella would be to breed chickens more resistant to Salmonella. Unfortunately resistance to Salmonella is a complex trait with many factors involved. To learn more about Salmonella resistance mechanisms in young chickens, a cDNA microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between a Salmonella susceptible and a more resistant chicken line. Newly hatched chickens were orally infected with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. Since the intestine is the first barrier the bacteria encountersbacteria encounter after oral inoculation, gene expression was investigated in the intestine, from day 1 until day 21 post infection. Differences in gene expression between the susceptible and resistant chicken line were found in control as well as Salmonella infected conditions. In response to the Salmonella infection, the expression of different sets of genes seemed to be affected in the jejunum of the two chicken lines. In the susceptible line this included genes that affect T-cell activation, whereas in the more resistant line, at day 1, macrophage activation seemed to be more affected. At day 7 and 9 most gene expression differences between the two chicken lines were identified under control conditions, indicating a difference in the intestinal development between the two chicken lines which might be linked to the difference in Salmonella susceptibility. The findings in this study have lead to the identification of novel genes and possible cellular pathways of the host involved in Salmonella susceptibility. Keywords: timecourse, disease
