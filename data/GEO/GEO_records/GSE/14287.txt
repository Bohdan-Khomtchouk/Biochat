TITLE
Expression data from precisely staged blastula wild-type and haploid Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In most embryos, the mid-blastula transition is a complex process featuring maternal RNA degradation, cell cycle pause, zygotic transcriptional activation and morphological changes. The nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio has been proposed to control the multiple events at MBT. To understand the global transcriptional response to the changes of the N/C ratio, we profiled wild type and haploid embryos using cDNA microarrays at three developmental stages. Keywords: time course and different genotype

DESIGN
For the diploid transcriptional profile, we prepared cDNA from hand selected wild-type embryos at cycle 13 interphase (15min after the nuclear division of cycle 12) and at early and late cycle 14 interphase (15min and 40 min after the nuclear division of cycle 13), respectively. For the haploid, cDNA was prepared from cycle 14 embryos  (15min after the nuclear division of cycle 13) and early and late cycle 15 embryos (15min and 40 minutes after the nuclear division of cycle 14). The collection was designed in this way so that each cell cycle stage of the diploid has a counterpart stage with matched  N/C ratio in the haploid (e.g. cycle 13 in the diploid has the same N/C ratio as cycle 14 in the haploid). In all experiments, the cell cycle progression was monitored by the Histone-GFP pattern. Triplicates of about 50 embryos each with right age were collected for each time point.
