TITLE
Identifying genes regulated by miR-490-3p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the direct target of miR-490-3p, we used whole genome microarray expression profiling to screen for genes potentially regulated by the microRNA.

DESIGN
AGS cells were transfected with control mimics or miR-490-3p mimics and gene expression was determined 72 hours after transfection.
