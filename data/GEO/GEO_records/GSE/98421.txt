TITLE
Expression data from subcutaneous adipose tissue of lean polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and normoandrogenic women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lean polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women have a greater proportion of android (abdominal) fat, increased numbers of small subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipocytes and preferential intra-abdominal fat accumulation. This study examines whether abnormal gene expression of SC abdominal adipose stem cells (ASCs) from lean PCOS women underlies this altered abdominal adipose structure-function. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from PCOS and NL subcutaneous adipose tissue. Differential expression of at least 1.5-fold change (P < 0.05) were obtained in 120 genes (48 upregulated, 72 downregulated) of SC abdominal ASCs from PCOS versus NL women
