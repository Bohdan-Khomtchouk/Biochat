TITLE
Whole blood gene expression of primary Sjogren's syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with the destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands is often accompanied by systemic manifestations. Existing therapies against pSS are symptomatic treatments, and there are no disease-modifying treatments that can change the natural course of pSS. We used microarrays to elucidate transcriptional programs associated with pSS. Proteomics and FACS data will be found in Synapse. https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8483276

DESIGN
30 pSS patients and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited and compared whole blood transcriptome
