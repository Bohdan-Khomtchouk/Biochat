TITLE
Whole blood gene expression of primary Sjogren's syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with the destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands is often accompanied by systemic manifestations. Existing therapies against pSS are symptomatic treatments, and there are no disease-modifying treatments that can change the natural course of pSS. We used microarrays to elucidate transcriptional programs associated with pSS. Proteomics and FACS data will be found in Synapse.

DESIGN
30 pSS patients and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited and compared whole blood transcriptome
