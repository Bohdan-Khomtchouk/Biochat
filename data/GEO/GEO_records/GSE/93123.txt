TITLE
Genomic instability during reprogramming by nuclear transfer is DNA replication dependent

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by nuclear transfer into oocytes, yet developmental  arrest often occurs. While incomplete transcriptional reprogramming is known to cause developmental failure, reprogramming also involves concurrent changes in gene expression, cell cycle progression and nuclear structure. Here we study cellular reprogramming events in human and mouse nuclear transfer (NT) embryos prior to embryonic genome activation. We show that genetic instability marked by frequent chromosome segregation errors and DNA damage arise prior to, and independent of, transcriptional activity. These errors occur following transition through DNA replication and are repaired by BRCA1. In the absence of mitotic nuclear remodeling, DNA replication is delayed and errors are exacerbated in subsequent mitosis. These results demonstrate that independent of gene expression, cell type-specific features of cell cycle progression constitute a barrier sufficient to prevent the transition from one cell type to another during reprogramming.
