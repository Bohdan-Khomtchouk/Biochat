TITLE
siPools: highly complex but accurately defined siRNA pools eliminate Off-target effects (HuGene-1_0 ENST)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Short interfering RNAs (siRNA) are widely used as tool for gene inactivation in basic research and therapeutic applications. One of the major shortcomings of siRNA experiments are sequence-specific Off-target effects. Such effects are largely unpredictable because siRNAs can affect partially complementary sequences and function like microRNAs (miRNAs), which inhibit gene expression on mRNA stability or translational levels. Here we demonstrate that novel, enzymatically generated siRNA pools - referred to as siPools - containing up to 60 accurately defined siRNAs eliminate Off-target effects. This is achieved by the low concentration of each individual siRNA diluting sequence-specific Off-target effects below detection limits. In fact, whole transcriptome analyses reveal that single siRNA transfections can severely affect global gene expression. However, when complex siRNA pools are transfected, almost no transcriptome alterations are observed. Taken together, we present enzymatically-produced complex but accurately defined siRNA pools with potent On-target silencing but without detectable Off-target effects.

DESIGN
To demonstrate the reduction of Off-target gene deregulation by use of complex siRNA pools (siPools), a single siRNA targeting human SCYL1 was transfected alone or in combination with 14 or 59 other siRNAs at a total siRNA concentration of 3 nM in human Hela cells. Mock transfected cells served as negative control. Every sample was tested in biological triplicates. Total RNA was extract 48h after transfection for affimetrix expression analysis.
