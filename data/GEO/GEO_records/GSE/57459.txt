TITLE
Identification of targets regulated by SELP in HSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying mechanism by which Alox15 gene is required by HSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, SELP-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+. The result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ and SELP-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+. Cancer stem cells are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of some types of cancer, and few effective target genes in these stem cells have been identified. Here we show that the selp is essential for the survival of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To understand the underlying mechanism through which SELP regulates the function of HSCs, the gene expression profiles between WT and Selp-/- HSCs were compared.
