TITLE
ISWI RNAi in Drosophila SL2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Profiling of changes in steady state RNA levels upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of the nucleosome remodeling ATPase ISWI in Drosophila SL2 cells. Quantitation of the corresponding proteomes has been performed to describe transcriptome-proteome relations. The analysis indicates a limited correlation of the two expression steps. Keywords: RNAi-mediated knockdown
