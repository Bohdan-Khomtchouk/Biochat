TITLE
The role of IRF6 in salivary gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Irf6 leads to disruption of branching morphogenesis and secretory acnii formation in salivary gland. To determine the differentially expressed genes in Irf6 mutant, embryonic salivary gland tissues were extracted at E14.5.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of Irf6 null salivary gland tissues and wild-type littermates at E14.5

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
