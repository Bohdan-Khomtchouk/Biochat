TITLE
next generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of control and TKO liver transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNAseq to analyse the transcriptomes of cycling and quiescent livers from cTKO (Rblox/lox;p130lox/lox;p107/) and control mice.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of cycling and quiescent control and TKO liver tissue were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate
