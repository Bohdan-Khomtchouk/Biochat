TITLE
RRBS and RNA-seq profiling of maize shoot and tassel primordium

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Profiling the methylation and gene expression between vegetative (coleoptile-stage shoots) and reproductive (tassel primordium) tissues with RRBS and RNA-seq

DESIGN
MseI-RRBS are promoter-enriched and CviQI-RRBS are genebody-enriched libraries.  RNA-Seq of shoots and tassels.
