TITLE
The effects of artificial tethering of chromosomes to the nuclear periphery using LacI/lap2b anchorage constructs, part 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment:   analysis of gene expression changes between B49.5 (non tethered)  vs B49.5 74t3 (lap2b-lacI tethered) that both possess a Chr4 128mer LacO integrant Keywords: comparative hybridization to access expression profiles between tethered and non tethred cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, stable transfections B49.5 (non tethered)  vs B49.5 74t3 (lap2b-lacI tethered) that both possess a Chr4 128mer LacO integrant . Biological replicates = 4 .
