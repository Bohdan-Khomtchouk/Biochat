TITLE
Expression data of agl62/- and wild-type seeds at 30 hrs after pollination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We generated deep sequencing data of total RNA isolated from seeds of homozygous agl62 mutants plants at 30 hrs after pollination.

DESIGN
agl62 and wild-type plants were emasculated 1-2 days prior to anthesis, hand-pollinated and seeds were harvested 30 h after pollination. Three biological replicates were generated per sample.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
