Monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with the TLR8 agonist 3M-002 at 10 microM show a prominent activation of TLR-dependent genes as assessed b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in the effects of TLR8 triggering of human monocyte-derived macrophages. We observed a striking upregulation of those genes. This work was done in the context of examining the effects of TLR8 triggering for the activation of HIV.
