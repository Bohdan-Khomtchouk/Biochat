TITLE
Monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with the TLR8 agonist 3M-002 at 10 microM show a prominent activation of TLR-dependent genes as assessed b " Human Toll-like Receptor PCR array pathway " over time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in the effects of TLR8 triggering of human monocyte-derived macrophages. We observed a striking upregulation of those genes. This work was done in the context of examining the effects of TLR8 triggering for the activation of HIV.

DESIGN
We generated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) by initially isolating monocytes and subsequently culturing them in RPMI supplemented with human AB serum. MDM were stimulated for 18 h with the TLR8 agonist 3M-002, and subsequently harvested for extraction of total RNA. Total RNA was then used to quantify the TLR-dependent genes using a PCR array pathway.
