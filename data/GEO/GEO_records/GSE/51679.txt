TITLE
ChIP-seq assays for H3K27ac

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By using FACS-sorted MC1-ZE7 ES cells, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of H3K27ac and DNA methylation in Zscan4 positive ES cells (Em+) and Zscan4 negative ES cells (Em-). H3K27 hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation were detected in heterochromatic regions of Em+ cells, but not Em- cells. These results suggested that the Zscan4 state takes " open " chromatin conformation in ES cells.

DESIGN
H3K27ac in Zscan4 positive and negative cells
