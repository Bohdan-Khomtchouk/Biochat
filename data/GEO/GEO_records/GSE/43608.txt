TITLE
Gene expression profile of HCT116 exposed to chronic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in survival to prolonged hypoxia we exposed HCT116 to hypoxia for 3 days. Control cells were exposed to normoxic conditions.

DESIGN
HCT116 colon cancer cells were serum starved and exposed to hypoxia (1%O2) or normoxia (21%O2) for 3 days.
