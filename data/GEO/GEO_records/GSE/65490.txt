TITLE
The effects of herb-partitioned moxibustion on miRNA expression profiling in the colons of CD rats

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA microarray, we screened differentially-expressed miRNAs in colons of normal control (NC) rats, model control (MC) rats and herb-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) rats. We found 40 miRNAs differentially expressed in CD rats’ colons compared with the NC rats, and HPM significantly regulated 26 miRNAs in colon tissues compared with the MC group. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that down-regulated miR-147 and miR-205 in CD rats’ colons were both significantly up-regulated by HPM, with 2.64- and 3.72-folds increased respectively, indicating that miR-147 and miR-205 are the target genes of HPM in treating CD rats.
