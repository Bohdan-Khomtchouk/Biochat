TITLE
The effects of herb-partitioned moxibustion on miRNA expression profiling in the colons of CD rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA microarray, we screened differentially-expressed miRNAs in colons of normal control (NC) rats, model control (MC) rats and herb-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) rats. We found 40 miRNAs differentially expressed in CD rats’ colons compared with the NC rats, and HPM significantly regulated 26 miRNAs in colon tissues compared with the MC group. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that down-regulated miR-147 and miR-205 in CD rats’ colons were both significantly up-regulated by HPM, with 2.64- and 3.72-folds increased respectively, indicating that miR-147 and miR-205 are the target genes of HPM in treating CD rats.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, four samples from each group were used to screen the differentially-expressed miRNAs in colons of experimental CD rats and the target genes of HPM. Six colons from each group were further used to verify the target genes of HPM. Finally, miR-147 and miR-205 were experimentally validated to be target genes of HPM.
