TITLE
Gene expression profiles from BMCs-expressing Genes Altered in MDS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BMCs from BMT recipient mice transplanted with BMCs-expressing EZH2-mutant were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse430_2 BMCs were extracted from BMT recipient mice transplanted with ABCG2-expressing BMCs and analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse430_2

DESIGN
EZH2-Mt expressing BMCs were sorted into GFP-positive and negative populations before RNA extraction. Whole BMCs were used for RNA extraction from ABCG2-expressing BMCs and compared to BMCs from control BMT mice.
