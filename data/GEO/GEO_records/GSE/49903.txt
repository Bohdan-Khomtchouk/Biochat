TITLE
Chromatin organization in NPP-13 knockdown C. elegans embryos [seq]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
C. elegans nuclear pore protein NPP-13 associates with small RNA genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase III. To test if the nuclear pore-chromatin interactions play a role in large-scale chromatin organization, we determined nuclear membrane-genome interactions and RNA Polymerase II localization in C. elegans embryos depleted for NPP-13.

DESIGN
Genome-wide ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip for nuclear membrane protein LEM-2, RNA Polymerase II (AMA-1) and H3K4me3 were performed in mixed-stage C. elegans embryos depleted for NPP-13. As a control, ChIP was also performed in wild-type embryos treated with empty vector.
