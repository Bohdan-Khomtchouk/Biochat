TITLE
Expression data from  PyMT;Lys Cre:E2f3 f/f  TAMs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying cause for reduced lung metastasis, we compared global gene expression profiles of F4/80+ FACS sorted tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)  PyMT;E2f3 f/f (control) and PyMT;Lys Cre:E2f3 f/f (experimental) mice. We compared gene expression profile between TAMs isolated from mammary tumors of  PyMT;E2f3 f/f and PyMT;Lys Cre:E2f3 f/f mice

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from F4/80+ TAMs from mammary tumors of 80 day old mice

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
