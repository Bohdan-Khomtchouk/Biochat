TITLE
RNA profiling from prostate FFPE specimens  (Nanostring)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study feasibility of gene expression profiling from FFPE tissues using NanoString nCounter platform, we designed a pilot study utilizing samples from prostate cancer cohort. We selected samples from large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials representative of a wide variety of fixation times, block ages and block storage conditions.

DESIGN
five paired tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissue speciemens with technical replicates

PLATFORM
GPL18292 NanoString nCounter Human Cancer Reference Kit
