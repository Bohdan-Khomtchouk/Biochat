TITLE
Effect of Cell Free Nucleic Acids (CFNA) extracted from blood products (red blood cells, plasma, platelets) on macrophage/dendritic cells gene regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages were exposed to CFNA from different blood products prior to gene expression array: Red Blood Cells units (RBC), Fresh Frozen Plasma Units (FFP) and Platelet Concentrates (PC). Extracts from PBS were used as controls. Biological triplicates were included with three different macrophage cell lines (M1, M2, M3).

DESIGN
CFNA extraction, exposition to human macrophages, RNA extraction after 24h, gene expression array PFC = FFP = Fresh Frozen Plasma units CE = RBC = Red Blood Cell units CP = PC = Platelet Concentrates

PLATFORM
GPL16043 GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (with External spike-in RNAs)
