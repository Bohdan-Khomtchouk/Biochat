TITLE
Array CGH of breast cancer cells with distinct metastatic properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Xenograft metastases from MDA-MB-231 cells and CN34 cells at different organs were collected and yielded sub-populations that exhibited increased metastagenicity to the lung or brain. Genomic aberrations of these subpopulations were profiled and compared to the parental populations.
