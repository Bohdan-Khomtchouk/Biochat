TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of Wild-Type C57BL/6J Mouse Cardiac Small RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides for quantitation of RNA abundances and comparison of RNA abundances within tissues and cells in a manner not possible with previous microarray technologies. We have made widespread use of Illumina sequencing technologies for RNA quantitation in several publications involving mouse hearts, dating from 2010, and wish to share both high-quality raw sequencing data and data processed to quantitate mRNA abundances from wild-type mice, male and female, at a variety of ages. These data will provide a resource for investigators using microarrays to understand the concentration of transcripts of interest relative to other cardiac RNAs, and will permit deeper interpretation of previous microarray studies.

DESIGN
6 cardiac small RNA (microRNA) profiles of 18 week-old C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice were generated on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.

PLATFORM
