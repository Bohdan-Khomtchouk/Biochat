TITLE
Global analysis of genes differentially expressed in branching and non-branching regions of the mouse embryonic lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During development, the proximal and distal regions of respiratory tract undergo distinct processes that ultimately give rise to conducting airways and alveoli. To gain insights into the genetic pathways differentially activated in these regions when branching morphogenesis is initiating, we characterized their transcriptional profiles in murine rudiments isolated at embryonic day 11.5. Keywords: parallel sample
