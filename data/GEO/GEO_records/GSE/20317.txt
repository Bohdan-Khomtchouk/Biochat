TITLE
Benign prostate epithelial cell gene expression after four weeks of treatment with daily transdermal DHT or placebo gel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Significant increases in serum DHT do not increase intraprostatic levels of DHT, PSA, prostate volume, or prostate epithelial cell androgen-regulated gene expression in healthy men. Changes in serum androgen concentrations are not necessarily mimicked within the prostate.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile benign prostate epithelium from twenty-seven men, twelve of which were treated for four weeks with daily transdermal DHT and 15 which were placebo gel treated controls. All samples were laser-capture microdissected and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a reference reference prostate cell line pool.
