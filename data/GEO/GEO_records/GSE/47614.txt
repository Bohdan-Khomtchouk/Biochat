TITLE
Characterization of genome-methylome interactions in 22 nuclear pedigrees

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the interaction between CpG methylation and genetic polymorphisms by taking the advantage of the family structure in 22 nuclear pedigrees. We have identified CpG sites that exhibit heritable methylation patterns, among which the majority are SNPs ditrectly disrupting CpG dinucleotides. We also identified 27.2% of the heritable non-SNP CpGs were associated with cis-regulatory SNPs. Additionally, we have identified hundreds of CpG clusters whose the degree of DNA methylation variation is associated with genetic polymorphism.

DESIGN
Investigate the influence of genetic variances on blood DNA methylation patterns in the human genome of 96 subjects from 22 pedigrees by using different approaches, including mid-parent offspring analysis (MPO), methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) analysis and allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) Raw data not provided since the files contain genetic information of the human subject that should be protected.
