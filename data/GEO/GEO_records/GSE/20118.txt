TITLE
Gene expression in whole-roots of a Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross population

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis of whole-genome gene expression in roots was carried out  in a (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides) X Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree. Genetic variation in gene expression was quantified for 55,793 predicted gene models based on a single probe per gene. Resultant data contributed to the analysis of the genetic architecture of gene expression in roots of  Populus.

DESIGN
Data include one biological replicate of 163 individuals segregating from a pseudo-backcross pedigree of (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides) X Populus deltoides analyzed for gene expression (GE) in roots using one probe per gene for 55793 independent gene models (probes E_POPLARSxxxxxPxxxxx) and single feature sequence polymorphism (SFP) using one probe per gene for 12084 independent gene models (probes G_POPLARSxxxxxPxxxxx). GE and SFP probes were selected from 6-7 probes per gene previously tested in a pilot study of the two parent trees of the cross (Populus deltoides X Populus trichocarpa)
