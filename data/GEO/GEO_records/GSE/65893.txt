TITLE
Gene Expression in AJ and AcB60 mice following Salmonella infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential genome-wide gene expression within the splenic homogenate of A/J and AcB60 mice, both naïve mice and those infected with Salmonella Typhimrium

DESIGN
Total RNA was islolated from the splenic homogenate of naïve A/J and AcB60 mice, as well as mice infected with 1000 CFUs of Salmonella Typhimuirum and sacrified 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
