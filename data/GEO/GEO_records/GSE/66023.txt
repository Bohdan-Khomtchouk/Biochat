TITLE
Histone H3 globular domain acetylation identifies new class of enhancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the acetylation of lysine residues in the globular domain of H3 (H3K64ac and H3K122ac) marks active gene promoters and also a subset of active enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), human erythroleukemic cell line (K562). Moreover, we find a novel class of active functional enhancers in ESCs that are marked by H3K122ac but which lack H3K27ac. This work suggests that a more complex analysis of histone acetylation is required to identify enhancers than was previously considered.

DESIGN
Examination of histone modifications in mouse ESCs (2 biological replicates) and K562 cells
