TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana senescent leaves treated with cytokinins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Cytokinins are plant hormones with biological functions ranging from coordination of plant growth and development to the regulation of senescence. A series of 2-chloro-N6-(halogenobenzylamino)purine ribosides was prepared and tested for cytokinin activity in selected bioassays. Several compounds showed significant activity, especially in delaying senescence in detached wheat leaves. We used microarrays to gather information about the reprogramming of gene transcription when senescent Arabidopsis leaves were treated with selected C2-substituted aromatic cytokinin ribosides that showed high activity in the senescence bioassay.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis senescent leaves were treated with cytokinins and subsequently used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 21-days old Arabidopsis leaves were treated with the appropriate cytokinin or left untreated (DMSO only).
