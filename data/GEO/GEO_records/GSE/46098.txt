TITLE
Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cortical interneurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we demonstrate the highly efficient derivation of human cortical interneurons in a NKX2.1::GFP hESC reporter line. Manipulating the timing of SHH activation yields three distinct GFP+ populations with specific transcriptional profiles, neurotransmitter phenotypes and migratory behaviors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated at day 18 of differentiation from FACS sorted NKX2.1::GFP+ cells from three varying differentiation conditions and a “No SHH” condition (no sonic hedgehog treatment) that did not contain any GFP-expressing cells (Trizol, Sigma). Samples for each group in triplicate were processed for Illumina bead arrays (Illumina HT-12) by the MSKCC genomics core facility according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
