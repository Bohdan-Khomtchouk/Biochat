TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Oenococcus oenos response to ethanol shock

ORGANISM
Oenococcus oeni PSU-1

SUMMARY
The correct development of malolactic fermentation depends on the capacity of Oenococcus oeni to survive under harsh wine conditions. The presence of ethanol is one of the most stressful factors affecting O. oeni performance. In this study, the effect of ethanol addition (12% vol/vol) on O. oeni PSU-1 has been evaluated using a transcriptomic approach.

DESIGN
Oenococcus oeni PSU-1 was grown in rich medium and after treated with the addition of ethanol (12% v/v) or the same volume of water. Samples were taken 1 and 3 hours after the treatment. Total RNA was analysed using a custom designed expression microarray.
