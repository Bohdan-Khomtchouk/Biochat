TITLE
Expression changes in cultured endothelial cells upon infection with HHV-8

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Tert-immortalized microvascular endothelial (TIME) cells are infected with human herpesvirus (HHV-8) or mocked infected to determine expression changes upon infection.

DESIGN
Three samples to TIME cells are infected with HHV-8 and three samples are mock-infected.
