TITLE
Comparison of Campylobacter jejuni isolates implicated in Guillain-Barre syndrome and strains that cause enteritis

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
We asked whether Campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients with Guillain-Barri syndrome (GBS) differ from isolates isolated from patients with uncomplicated gastrointestinal infection using DNA microarray analysis. We found that specific GBS genes or regions were not identified, and microarray analysis confirmed significant genomic heterogeneity among the isolates. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
