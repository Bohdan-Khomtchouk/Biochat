TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for NF1-associated glioma risk

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed whole genome SNP profiling on DNA samples from 236 patients with NF1, 123 with glimoa tumors and 113 without; 117 females and 119 males, together with 29 control samples.  To identify polymorphisms in human adenylate cyclase 8 (AC8) which correlate with glioma risk in NF1 in a sex-specific manner, Ac8 SNP were extracted and further analyzed for their sex-specific NF1-associated glioma risk. Three SNPs on ADCY8 were found signficant while other SNPs on CXCR7 and ADCYAP1 were promising.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from blood samples or saliva samples in three separate sets with one processed in Washington University and two in University of Utah. The data included 29 control samples and 236 NF1 patient samples (123 with and 113 without GBM) with 153 blood specimen and 97 saliva specimen.
