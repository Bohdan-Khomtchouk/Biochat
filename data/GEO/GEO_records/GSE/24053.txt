TITLE
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and the BAS1-deletion strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The impact on mRNA expression of the transcription factors Bas1, Pho2, Gcn4 and Gcr2p  was investigated in the corresponding deletion strains during exponential growth in glucose minimal media batch cultures.

DESIGN
All strains were grown in the same media and harvested during exponential growth, at the same cell density, for gene expression analysis. Gene expression analysis of each deletion mutant can be compared relative to the reference strain FY4. Three replicates each strain.
