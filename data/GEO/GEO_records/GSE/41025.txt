TITLE
eQTL linkages in wine yeasts to decipher regulatory networks in wine fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed here the transcriptomic profile of 44 segregants from a cross between S288c and 59A (a spore of EC1118 strain). The analysis was performed in wine fermentation condition in stationary phase during nitrogen starvation and in alcoholic stress. These data, associated with an individual genotyping by Affymetrix array allow us to highlight genetic variations involved in perturbation of regulatory network and fermentative behavior.

DESIGN
56 transcriptomic profiles were performed with Agilent mono-color array. 6 hybridizations were performed for each parental strains: 3 technical replicates for 2 biological replicated samples (59As1 and 59As5; S288Cs1 and S288Cs5). One hybridization was performed for each of the 44 segregants. Using mono-color array, the logarithm base 2 of intensity was directly used after normalization.
