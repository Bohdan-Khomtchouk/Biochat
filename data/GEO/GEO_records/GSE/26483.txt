TITLE
Gene expression data from treated LNCaP prostate cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling at all stages of the disease and cyclin D1 has been shown to negatively modulate the expression of the AR-dependent gene prostate specific antigen (KLK3/PSA). Unbiased gene expression profiling was performed to determine the androgen-regulated geneset that is sensitive to cyclin D1.

DESIGN
Androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were straved of androgen, then transduced with control green fluorescent protein (GFP) or cyclin D1 (CCND1) adenovirus, then subsequently stimulated with control (Ethanol) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
