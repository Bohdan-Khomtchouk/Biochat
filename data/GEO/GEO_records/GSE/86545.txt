TITLE
Effect of SETD8/PR-Set7 knockdown on gene expression profiles in human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is an ireversible growth arrest with alterd metabolic potentials including DNA, RNA and protein dynamics. We found that loss of the SETD8/PR-Set7 methyltransferase, which catalyzes mono-methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), induces senescence in human fibroblasts. To investigate the role of SETD8 in cellular senescence, we performed a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis in SETD8-knockdown cells. Our results demonstrate that SETD8 links the epigenomic gene regulation to senescence-associated metabolic remodeling.

DESIGN
IMR-90 cells were transfected with Ctrl, SETD8-1 or SETD8-2 siRNAs for 24h.
