TITLE
Hypo-osmotic shock - ppt1 and wildtype

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type and ppt1 mutant under hypo-osmotic shock. Cultures were grown with 1M sorbitol for ~20 hours, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in YPD at time zero. Samples were collected at 0, 7, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after transfer to YPD. Experimental samples were used to generate Cy5-labeled cDNA probes, whereas mRNA reference pools extracted from cultures of the respective strains grown to early log phase under normal conditions, were used to generate Cy3-labeled cDNA probes.  Cy5- and Cy3-labeled probes were hybridized together to microarrays printed with PCR-amplified fragments, representing 6280 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs. Keywords: time-course
