TITLE
Oviductal expression data from wild type and Wt1 heterozygous mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in wild type and Wt1 (Wilms tumor suppressor gene 1) heterozygous knockout mice. Background: in Wt1+/- mice (MF1 strain) litter sizes are significantly smaller than in wild type animals. In addition, we observe retarded embryonic development of pre-implantation embryos that are still within the oviduct. By gene expression analysis we want to elucidate the molecular basis for these phenomena.

DESIGN
3 wild type and 3 heterozygous RNA samples

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
