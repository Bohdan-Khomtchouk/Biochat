TITLE
Serum miR-122-5p and miR-206 expression: Non-invasive prognostic biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the small non-coding RNA expression profile in cell-free serum RNA of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and patients with benign renal tumors (BRT) in order to identify novel non-invasive biomarkers for patients with RCC. Aims: (1) to compare the expression profile of patients with RCC and BRT. (2) to compare the expression profile of patients with localized (M=0) and metastatic (M=1) RCC.

DESIGN
small RNA expression profiling and sequencing in serum of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign renal tumors (BRT)

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
