TITLE
Thermospermine-induced transcriptomic changes in Populus stem

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

SUMMARY
Thermospermine-induced transcriptomic changes were explored in Populus tremula x P. tremuloides. Transgenic hybrid aspen plants expressing 35S::POPACAULIS5 were compared to wild-type hybrid aspen under the influence of PGRs and depleted from PGRs.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from stem tissues of transgenic plants carrying 35S::POPACAULIS5 either grown on auxin-containing and -depleted media were compared to wild-type grown also under the both conditions. Three biological replicates for each pair genotype/growth condition were performed.

PLATFORM
