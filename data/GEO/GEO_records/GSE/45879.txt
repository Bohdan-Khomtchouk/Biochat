TITLE
Thermospermine-induced transcriptomic changes in Populus stem

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Thermospermine-induced transcriptomic changes were explored in Populus tremula x P. tremuloides. Transgenic hybrid aspen plants expressing 35S::POPACAULIS5 were compared to wild-type hybrid aspen under the influence of PGRs and depleted from PGRs.
