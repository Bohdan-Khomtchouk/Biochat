TITLE
Genome-wide identification of DAF-12 binding sites in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
DAF-12 is involved in development, dauer formation, and aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. To understand how DAF-12 is involved in these biologic processes, we performed chIP-chip using a DAF-12:TAP transgene and an anti-DAF-12 antibody. We identified 1175 genomic binding sites which were located within 5 kb of 3179 genes. These genes include known DAF-12 target genes as well as new genes involved in developmental timing, microRNA function, and stress resistance. The supplemental BED file contains all 1175 genomic binding sites described in our work.

DESIGN
DAF-12:TAP transgenic worms with chIP performed using an anti-DAF-12 antibody compared to input chromatin and chIP performed using the daf-12(rh61rh411) null mutant.
