TITLE
A bacterial receptor PcrK senses the plant hormone cytokinin to promote adaptation to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris

SUMMARY
By analyzing the transcriptome of WT/ΔpcrR/ΔpcrK strains in the presence of 2iP and comparing gene expression level between them, we report genes with different expression levels between WT and ΔpcrR/ΔpcrK strains in the presence of plant cytokinin 2iP.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profile of all three strains were generated by high-throughput sequencing, Illumina Hiseq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL24162 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris)
