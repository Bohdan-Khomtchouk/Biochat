TITLE
Transcriptional profile Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 : p-coumaric acid (p-CA) treated cells

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling was used to characterize the response of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 human isolate during challenge with p-coumaric acid (p-CA). Twelve independent experiments were performed and mixed at random in groups of four for total of three RNA samples. The transcriptional profile reveals a massive induction of genes involved in stress resistance and detoxification-related functions and a global shutdown of growth-associated processes.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates: untreated cells: Control vs. p-coumaric treated cells: Experimental
