TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 cells treated with Neuregulin (NRG) at different times

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanism responsible for the protumorigenic actions of NRG we performed gene expression analyses of MCF7 cells treated with soluble NRG for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with NRG for 0, 3, 6,12, 24 hours, 3 for each condition, prepared from three different experiments
