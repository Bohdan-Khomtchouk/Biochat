TITLE
Expression data from BeWo cells treated without or with PKA- or EPAC-selected cAMP analogs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cyclic AMP activates two downstream factors, protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) and both downstream signalings induce syncytialization, cell fusion and the production of hCG and progesterone. We used microarray to identify novel transcription factors related to syncytialization in two cAMP signaling-stimulated BeWo cells.

DESIGN
Human placenta choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo cells were treated without or with Epac- or PKA-selective cAMP analogs for 48 h, of which RNAs were extracted and subjected to Affymetrix microarrays.
