TITLE
Transcriptomic of early embryonic invasion at implantation sites in a murine model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trophoblast Invasion is a complex mechanism that involves several genes and processes that are exquisitely regulated by the mother. Functional genomics has shown that immunomodulatory and proliferation are two essential key processes involved.

DESIGN
Adult virgin B6CBA F1/J female mice were mated with CD1 fertile males to induce pregnancy (day 0=vaginal plug). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Implantation and inter-implantation sites were divided by sharp dissection 6.5 days post-coitum (dpc) (n=3 mice). Uterine segments included uterine myometrium, stroma, and epithelium. Inter-implantation decidua (ID) were collected and Implantation sites also were divided by sharp dissection to separate extra-embryonic tissue (ET) from surrounding decidua (SD). From the embryo, only the invasive trophoblast formed by the ectoplacental cone was studied too.
