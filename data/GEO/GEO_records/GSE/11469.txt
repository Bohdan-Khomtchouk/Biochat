TITLE
Clock genes in human oral mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms are daily oscillations of multiple biological processes driven by endogenous clocks. Imbalance of these rhythms has been associated with cancerogenesis in humans. To further elucidate the role of the circadian clock in cellular growth control, tumor suppression and cancer treatment, a standard of circadian gene regulations in healthy men is essential. Comparative microarray analyses were conducted investigating the relative mRNA expression of clock genes throughout a 24-hour period in biopsies obtained from oral mucosa of eight healthy diurnally active male study participants. A custom-designed oligo-based microarray which in addition to oncogenes and inflammatory genes contains probes for 20 clock genes and 70 clock-associated genes in human was used. Keywords: Human gene expression study

DESIGN
Reference design with Cy3 labeled uniRNA and Cy5 labeled sample RNA.
