TITLE
In vitro expansion of single adult Lgr5+ liver cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Wnt target gene Lgr5 marks actively dividing stem cells in Wnt-driven, self-renewing tissues such as small intestine and colon, stomach and hair follicles. A 3D culture system allows long-term clonal expansion of single Lgr5+ stem cells into transplantable organoids that retain many characteristics of the original epithelial architecture. A crucial component of the culture medium is the Wnt agonist Rspo, the recently discovered ligand of Lgr5. Here we show that Lgr5-LacZ is not expressed in healthy adult liver, yet that small Lgr5-LacZ+ cells appear near bile ducts upon damage, coinciding with robust activation of Wnt signaling. As shown by lineage tracing using a novel Lgr5-ires-CreERT2 knock-in allele, damage-induced Lgr5+ cells generate hepatocytes and bile ducts in vivo.  Single Lgr5+ cells from damaged liver can be clonally expanded as organoids in Rspo1-based culture medium over multiple months. Such clonal organoids can be induced to differentiate in vitro and to generate functional hepatocytes upon transplantation into FAH-/- mice. These findings imply that previous findings on Lgr5+ stem cells in actively self-renewing tissues extend to damage-induced stem cells in a tissue with a low rate of spontaneous self-renewal.

DESIGN
We first generated arrays from multiple wildtype tissues including muscle, white adipose tissues, brown adipose tissues, liver and pancreas. Then we generated arrays from liver derived cultures maintained in different conditions, and compared the expression profile with the corresponding parental tissues and other non-related tissues.
