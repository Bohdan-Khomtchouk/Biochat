TITLE
Responses to inhibitors in an industrial strain of yeast and the adapted strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Furfural, phenol and acetic acid, generated during cellulosic material pretreatment, are the representative inhibitors to yeast used for ethanol production. The responses to these inhibitors in industrial yeast and the corresponding adapted strains were analyzed.

DESIGN
We analyzed the transient response to inhibitors and the different transcriptions in industrial yeast and furfural-, phenol-, and acetic acid-adapted strains. Industrial yeast and the adapted strains were collected at 20 minutes after inhibitor addition. The reference samples for industrial yeast and adapted strains were collected at the same time without inhibitor addition. 2 replicates for each strain/treatment were analyzed.
