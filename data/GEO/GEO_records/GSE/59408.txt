TITLE
Prediction of antibiotic resistance by large-scale phenotypic and genotypic data

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The evolution of antibiotic resistance is a clear example of adaptation by natural selection. Although a number of mutations contributing to the resistance have been identified, the relationship between the mutations and the related phenotypic changes responsible for the resistance has yet to be fully elucidated. To better characterize phenotype-genotype mapping for drug resistance, we performed parallel laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli under the selection of single antibiotics and after 90 days propagation obtained resistant strains. We find that an acquisition of resistance to one drug drastically changes the resistance and susceptibility to other drugs. Based on transcriptome data of these strains, we demonstrated that the resistances could be quantitatively predicted by the expression changes of a small number of genes. Whole-genome resequencing analysis provided several candidate mutations contributing to the resistances, while phenotype-genotype mapping was suggested to be complex and included various mutations that caused similar phenotypic changes. The integration of transcriptome and genome data enables us to extract essential phenotypic changes for drug resistances.

DESIGN
To examine the contribution of the gene expression changes to the antibiotic resistances, transcriptome of the parent strain (duplicated) and 40 resistant strains (4 parallel-evolved resistant strains for 10 antibiotics) were analyzed.
