TITLE
Heritable epigenetic variation among maize inbreds

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Epigenetic variation describes heritable differences that are not attributable to changes in DNA sequence.  Methylation of cytosine residues provides a mechanism for the inheritance of epigenetic information.  We have profiled the distribution of DNA methylation in the large, complex genome of Zea mays (ssp. mays).  DNA methylation levels are higher near the centromeres and are generally inversely correlated with recombination and gene expression levels.  However, genes that are located in non-syntenic genomic positions relative to species related closely to maize exhibit higher levels of DNA methylation independent of expression state.  A comparison of the DNA methylation levels in two different inbred genotypes, B73 and Mo17, allowed for the identification of approximately 700 differentially methylated regions.  The regions of differential methylation in B73 and Mo17 often occur in intergenic regions but some of these regions are located within or near genes.  There is evidence that variation in DNA methylation levels can occur in genomic regions that are identical-by-descent, illustrating the potential for epigenetic variation that is not tightly linked to genetic changes.  A comparison of the genotype and epigenotype in a panel of near-isogenic lines reveals evidence for epigenetic variation that is conditioned by linked regions as well as examples of epigenetic variation that is conditioned by unlinked genomic regions.  Our many examples of epigenetic variation, including some without tightly linked genetic variation, have implications for plant breeding and for natural selection.

DESIGN
Methylation profiles in seedling tissue of the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17. Each genotype was compared for three biological replications using a gene-focused custom 2.1M NimbleGen array.
