TITLE
Expression data from Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitor (MEP) cells isolated from WT, Ezh2Δ/Δ, JAK2V617F, and JAK2V617F/Ezh2Δ/Δ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss-of-function mutations in EZH2 are associated with worse outcomes in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF).  To understand how EZH2 insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of PMF, we generated mice compound for Ezh2 conditional deletion and a JAK2V617F transgene.

DESIGN
The total bone marrow cells isolated from Cre-ERT2, Ezh2flox/flox;Cre-ERT2, JAK2V617F;Cre-ERT2 and JAK2V617F;Ezh2flox/flox;Cre-ERT2 mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ wild-type recipient mice. As we deleted Ezh2 at four weeks post transplantation, we performed gene-expression analysis of LSKs and MEPs isolated from the recipient mice at 2 months post transplantation.
