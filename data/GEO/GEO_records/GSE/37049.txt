TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in differentiated human primary keratinocytes depleted for Grainyhead like 3 (GRHL3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary keratinocytes were depleted of GRHL3 by siRNA and induced to differentiated for 2 days by addition of Calcium

DESIGN
Primary normal human keratinocytes were transfected with GRHL3 or scrambled control siRNA using RNAi max (Life Technologies). 24 hours post transfection medium was raised to 1.8mM to induce differentiation.  Cells were collected 48 hours later.
