TITLE
Tissue overgrowth induced by coexpression of the progenitor genes hth/MEIS1 and tsh/TSHZ results from an imbalance in the estrogen response pathway in Drosophila [FAIRE-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Analysis of third instar eye-antennal Drosophila imaginal discs with forced expression of hth, tsh or hth+tsh in the eye using an eye-specific GAL4 driver (optix2.3-GAL4). Forced maintenance of hth+tsh expression (but not of any of the two alone) results in overgrowth and aberrant cell differentiation. Results provide insight into new targets of hth+tsh.

DESIGN
RNA-seq gene expression profiling across Drosophila 3rd instar larval wild type eye-antennal discs and genetic perturbations of tsh, hth and tsh-hth together.
