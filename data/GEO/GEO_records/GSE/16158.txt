TITLE
Gene expression induced by trace fear conditioning in murine hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling following different learning paradigms may help in defining the moleular pathways of memory formation. In this study we analyzed the gene expression pattern of murine hippocampus at different time points (0.5 h, 2h, 6h) after trace fear conditioning. We compared trained mice with  naive mice that remained in their homecages. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We used 3 arrays for each experimental condition. Each array was hybridized witha a pool of RNA of 6 animals.
