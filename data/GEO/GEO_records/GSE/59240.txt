TITLE
The Gene expression gradient through the intestine tract of European Sea Bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)

ORGANISM
Dicentrarchus labrax

SUMMARY
A custom high density oligo-microarray (8 x 15K) was designed and printed by means of the eArray web tool (Agilent) to analyze the transcriptome of the three intestinal sections  of Euroipan sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Na√Øve stock juveniles sea bass, maintained under intensive rearing conditions in the indoor experimental facilities of IATS, were sampled after overnight fasting for anterior, middle and posterior sections of intestine. The array comprised 60-oligomer sequences for 14,147 different sea bass annotated sequences. Total RNA (150ng) from individual fish were labelled with cyanine 3-CTP and 1,000ng of each labelled cRNA were hybridized to microarray slides. Analysis of the scanned data, including principal component analysis and unpaired t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction, was carried out with GeneSpring GX software (Agilent). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed sequences was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.

DESIGN
Three intestine sections (anterior-ANT-, middle-MED-, and posterior-POS-) were analyzed
