TITLE
Genome-wide activity of unliganded Estrogen Receptor alpha in breast cancer cells [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERα is essential for the anti-proliferative response of breast cancer cells not only to estrogen antagonists, but also to estrogen withdrawal by means of aromatase inhibitors. We explored here one of the simplest explanation for this, consisting in the possibility that ERα may have a wide genomic function in absence of ligands. The genomic binding of ERα in the complete absence of estrogen was then studied using hormone-dependent MCF7 cells, by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. From these data, 4.2K highly significant binding events were identified, which were further confirmed by comparing binding events in cells expressing ERα to cells silenced for ERα. Apo-ERα binding sites were distributed close to genes with functions associated to cell growth and epithelial maintenance and show significant overlap with binding of other transcription factors important for luminal epithelial breast cancer. Interestingly, we found that upon ERα silencing cognate gene transcription in absence of estrogen is downregulated and this is accompanied by increased H27Kme3 at ERα binding sites. RNA-Seq experiments showed that unliganded ERα controls basal transcription widely, including both coding and noncoding transcripts. Genes affected by ERα silencing can be easily functionally related to mammary epithelium differentiation and maintenance, especially when considering downregulated genes. Additional functions related to inflammatory and immune response was observed. Our data unravel unexpected actions of ERα in breast cancer cells and provide a novel framework to understand success and failure of hormone therapy in breast cancer.
