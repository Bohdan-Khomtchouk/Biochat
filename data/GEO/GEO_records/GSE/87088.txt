TITLE
The expression changes of RNA binding proteins during human myeloid differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used CD34-positive cells isolated from cord blood to differentiate to granulocytic and monocytic lineages, respectively. Poly A-enriched RNA-seq was performed on the day 5, 10 and 15 samples of both granulocytic and monocytic lineages.

DESIGN
We forcused on the RNA binding proteins involved in granulocytic and monocytic lineage differentiation.
