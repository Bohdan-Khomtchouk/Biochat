TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis during heat stress and after the following recovery in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
To elucidate the effect of heat stress and the following recovery on grapevines and identify some regulated genes representing the classical heat stress response and thermotolerance mechanisms, transcript abundance of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) were quantified using the Affymetrix Grape Genome oligonucleotide microarray (15,700 transcripts), followed by quantitive Real-Time PCR validation for some transcript profiles. The treatment: heat stress(5h) and the following recovery (18.5h), sampling were conducted at two time respectively.  ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Lijun Wang.

DESIGN
temperature: 45 C(3-replications); temperature: 25 C(3-replications); temperature: 45-25 C(3-replications); temperature: 25-25 C(3-replications)
