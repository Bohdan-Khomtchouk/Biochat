TITLE
DNA unmethylome profiling by covalent capture of CpG sites (microarray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present an approach for the mapping of unmethylated DNA. Our technique is based on DNA methyltransferase-directed transfer of activated groups (mTAG) and covalent biotin tagging of unmodified CpG sites followed by affinity enrichment and interogation on tiling microarrays or next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
mapping of unmethylated DNA
