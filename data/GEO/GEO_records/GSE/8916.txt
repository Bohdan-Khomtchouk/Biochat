TITLE
Gene expression changes with inducible expression of activated ras and ras effector domain mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to identify gene transcription changes in cells expressing activated H-RasV12 or activated versions of the ras effector domain mutants RasV12G37, RasV12S35, and RasV12C40 for the purpose of identifying common or unique transcription alterations in cells transformed by different ras signal transduction pathways. Keywords: genetic modification design
