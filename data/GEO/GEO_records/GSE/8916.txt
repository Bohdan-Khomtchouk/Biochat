TITLE
Gene expression changes with inducible expression of activated ras and ras effector domain mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to identify gene transcription changes in cells expressing activated H-RasV12 or activated versions of the ras effector domain mutants RasV12G37, RasV12S35, and RasV12C40 for the purpose of identifying common or unique transcription alterations in cells transformed by different ras signal transduction pathways. Keywords: genetic modification design

DESIGN
HME16C mammary epithelial cells infected with pLRT control vector, or H-RasV12-, V12G37-, V12S35-, or V12C40-expressing vectors were each treated with 250ng/mL doxycycline and total RNA prepared at two separate times to give two biological replicates. Then dye swap experiments were performed with each biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL1528 NCI/ATC Hs-OperonV2
