TITLE
Expression data from intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress and celllular apoptosis of intestinal epithelial tissues relies on the environments from drinking different waters. In the rat intestinal epithelium, the toxic materials or antioxidant materials may affect the genes expression of oxidative stress and apoptosis through the oral intake ofa waters or agents. The up- or down-regulation in the antioxidant genes and apoptosis-related genes may represent the internal microenvironments in the intestine. Therefore, we used intestinal epithelium from rats drinking different waters to test the several genes expression. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying damage or protection effect and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes during drinking different waters test in this process.

DESIGN
Rat intestinal epithelium treated with water restriction for 12 hr, tap water, DSW1200 water or selenium water drinking for three days respectiveily
