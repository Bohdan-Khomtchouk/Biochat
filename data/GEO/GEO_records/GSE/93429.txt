TITLE
Comparison of ox-BS-450k 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and BS-450k 5-methylcytosine profiles in the human placenta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bisulphite (BS) and oxidative bisulphite (oxBS) converted DNA from 4 normal human placentas were hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip v1.2, obtaining the BS and oxBS DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. By using the oxBS treatment, the selective chemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and the deamination of the latter to uracil during the BS conversion allowed the quantification of independent 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC methylation levels at every single CpG. In consequence, this data set characterizes the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in the human placenta offerring a high-confidence list of intervals enriched for 5hmC in this tissue.

DESIGN
Bisulphite and oxidative bisulphite converted DNA from 4 human placenta samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.2
