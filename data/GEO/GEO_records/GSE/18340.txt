TITLE
Anaerobic carbon-limited retentostat cultivation of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was grown under anaerobic carbon-limited conditions in a chemostat with complete biomass retention (retentostat). In this cultivation system, the biomass concentration progressively increases while the dilution rate is kept constant, resulting in decreased specific susbtrate availibility, and hence, a progressive decrease in the specific growth rate. During the progressive transition from growth to virtually no growth, the global changes occurring at the level of metabolism and gene expression were studied using a genome-scale metabolic model and DNA microarrays.
