TITLE
DNA Methylation in IMR90 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation was measured by MBD2 enrichment of DNA fragments in IMR90. A statistical model was developed to estimate absolute methylation levels, and compared to whole genome bisulfite sequencing results (Lister, R. et al. (2009) Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences. Nature)

DESIGN
Two techincal replicates of MBD2 methylated DNA enrichment in IMR90 cells.
