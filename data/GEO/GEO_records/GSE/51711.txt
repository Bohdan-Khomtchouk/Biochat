TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although in 80% of CLL cases that require therapy is possible to achieve a complete  remission using a combination of fludarabine, anti-CD20 in conjunction with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone, 20% of patients do not achieve disease control with this conventional approach.  The main reason of complete remission failure is chemorefractoriness to fludarabine that occurs in up to 10% of patients requiring treatment. In order to identify new molecular predictors of refractoriness as well as druggable therapeutic targets, we combined next-generation sequencing and copy number analyses. Affymetrix SNP array analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic samples.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 10 FR-CLL samples and their paired normal (non-tumoral) DNA samples, processed in the same experiment and deposited (discovery set). The analysis was then extended to 29 additional FR-CLL tumoral samples and 3 Normal DNAs processed in the same experiment, including the Reference Normal DNA provided by Affymetrix (screening set).
