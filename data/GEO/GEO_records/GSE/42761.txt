TITLE
A key role for neuropeptide Y in lifespan extension and cancer suppression by dietary restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Key molecules that modulate the effect of dietary restriction (DR), a well-known laboratory intervention for longevity in organisms, remain elusive in mammals. We evaluated neuropeptide Y (Npy), which is involved in the physiological adaptation to energy deficits, for its role in the effects of DR.

DESIGN
At 12 weeks of age, Npy-/- and WT mice were divided into the AL (ad libitum) and DR groups. The DR groups received a food allotment consisting of 70% of the mean daily food intake of the AL groups. Two replicates per genotype per feeding group.
