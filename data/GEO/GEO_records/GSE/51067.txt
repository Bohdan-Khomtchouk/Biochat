TITLE
nc886, a noncoding RNA of anti-proliferative role, is suppressed by CpG DNA methylation in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
nc886 is a 101 nucleotides long non-coding RNA that is also known as a precursor microRNA or a vault RNA. nc886 has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor, mainly inferred by its expression pattern as well as its genomic location at human chromosome 5q31, a locus for a tumor suppressor gene(s). In order to understand potential roles of nc886 in gastric cancer, we performed the knockdown of nc886 in nonmalignant HFE-145 cells and identified and analyzed genes whose expression is activated by nc886 knockdown in gastric cancer.
