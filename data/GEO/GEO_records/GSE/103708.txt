TITLE
The profile of exosomal and cellular miRNA in ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To check the profile of exosomal and cellular miRNA in ovarian cancer cell lines, total RNA were extracted from exosomes and cells. Thirteen ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, ES-2, CAOV3, SKOV3, OV-90, OAW42, MCAS, COV362, RMG-1, RMUG-S, KURAMOCHI, NIH-OVCAR3 and A2780cis) were investigated, and HOSE1, HOSE2 and HOSE3 (human ovarian surface epithelim cell lines) were used as control.

DESIGN
To check the profile of exosomal and cellular miRNA in ovarian cancer cell lines, total RNA were extracted from exosomes and cells. Microarray analysis was performed using 50 ng of exosomal miRNAs and 100 ng of cellular miRNAs.
