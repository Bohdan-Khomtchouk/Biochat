TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of primary human monocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order investigate the control of genes encoding cytoskeletal motor proteins and their interaction partners in the activation program of primary monocytes, we performed whole transcriptome microarray profiling of ex vivo monocyte differentiation to activated macrophages or dendritic cells in monocytes isolated from three anonymous blood donors.

DESIGN
Monocytes were isolated from the buffy coats of three anonymous blood donors and differentiated into activated macrophages or activated dendritic cells (DCs) ex vivo. Total RNA from monocytes, activated macrophages or DCs was isolated and submitted for whole transcriptome microarray analysis.
