TITLE
Detection of plant microRNAs in EVOO and plasma samples of healthy volunteers 2 hours postingestion of 40 mL of EVOO.

ORGANISM
Olea europaea ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NGS has been applied to microRNA-enriched RNA obtained from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), beer and plasma samples of healthy volunteers that usually consume EVOO hours after the ingestion of 40 mL of EVOO. Results: We did not detect significant amount of microRNA in the EVOO samples. Plasma samples did not contain EVOO microRNAs nor other microRNAs from plant origin.

DESIGN
Starting plant material was 30 mL of EVOO or a pool of plasma samples of 5 volunteers
