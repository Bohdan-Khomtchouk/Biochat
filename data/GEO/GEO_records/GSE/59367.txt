TITLE
Hyperactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by multiple oncogenic events causes addiction to eIF4E-dependent mRNA translation in T-cell leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T-ALL cell lines versus Bl57/6J spleen We investigated how RTK signaling might contribute to T-ALL using an established bone marrow transplantation model. To mimick tyrosine kinase signalling we expressed a constitutively active form of the TRKA receptor tyrosine kinase (ΔTrkA) in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mice transplanted with ΔTrkA transduced cells developed T-ALL with a high penetrance.

DESIGN
comparative hybridization of DNA from T-ALL clones versus reference DNA (spleen)
