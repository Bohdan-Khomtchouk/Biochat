TITLE
Epigenetic adaptation to uncontrolled heterochromatin spreading

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Heterochromatin, a highly compact chromatin state characterized by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and HP1 protein binding, epigenetically silences the underlying DNA and influences the expression of neighboring genes. Therefore the sites of heterochromatin assembly and its subsequent spreading are generally precisely determined. Here we show that in fission yeast, the combined absence of anti-silencing factors Mst2 and Epe1 results in uncontrolled heterochromatin spreading and severe growth defects. Interestingly, these cells quickly recover by accumulating H3K9me at the clr4+ locus, which encodes the H3K9 methyltransferase essential for heterochromatin assembly, thereby leading to reduced expression of Clr4 to restrain heterochromatin spreading. Preventing H3K9me at the clr4+ locus resulted in the accumulation of H3K9me at the rik1+ locus, which encodes another component of the Clr4 complex essential for H3K9me. Our results demonstrate that promiscuous heterochromatin assembly enables fast adaptation in response to changes in chromatin landscape and illustrate a negative feedback mechanism by which cells counteract toxic heterochromatin accumulation.
