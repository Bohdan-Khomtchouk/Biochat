TITLE
Gene expression signature of differentiated human and mouse muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling was used to identify differentially expressed factors in differentiated and un-differentiated human and mouse muscle cells

DESIGN
Human and mouse muscle progenitor cells were differentiated in vitro for 8 and 5 days respectively. The RNA was then extracted and used for gene expression microarray on Agilent 4x44K platform. There were two to three biological replicates for each sample.
