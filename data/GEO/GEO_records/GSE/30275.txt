TITLE
Surface Functionalities of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) Impacts Embryonic Gene Expression Responses

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome expression pattern of 24 and 48 hours post fertilization Danio Rerio embryos exposed to 1.5nm MES- and TMAT- AuNPs. TMAT is a positively charged (cationic) ligand, and MES is a negatively charged (anionic) ligand.

DESIGN
Embryos were exposed to 10ug/mL of 1.5nm TMAT-AuNPs, 50ug/mL of 1.5nm MES-AuNPs or control from 6hpf to 24 or 48 hpf. Three replicates were collected for each time point. 40 embryos were pooled to comprise a replicate.
