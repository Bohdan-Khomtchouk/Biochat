TITLE
Identification of TDP-43 and FUS mRNA targets and pathways in the cytoplasmic compartment of motoneuronal NSC-34 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) and microarray (RIP-chip) analyses to identify and compare the biological mRNA targets of two RNA-binding proteins (RBP), TDP-43 and FUS, associated to cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes of motoneuronal NSC-34 cells with the final aim to unravel their role in mRNA transport, stability, and translation in neuronal cells.

DESIGN
To identify the transcripts contained and bound in the isolated RNP complexes, a chip analysis was performed using the recovered mRNAs from triplicate experimantal RIP samples (TDP-43-IP samples, the FUS-IP samples and the control IgG-IP sample).
