TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing and Assembly of Canna indica Flower

ORGANISM
Canna indica

SUMMARY
Canna indica L. is an ornamental plant with petaloid staminodes and only a half fertile stamen in its flowers. The genetic basis for petaloid androecium remains unclear. In order to get comprehensive transcriptome data for further studies, RNA-Seq analysis were carried out. Two libraries from flower primordia and differentiated flowers of Canna indica were constructed and sequenced respectively, and totally 118,869 unigenes were assembled. The unigenes were aligned to the protein databases NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG and GO (e-value < 0.00001), and totally 67,299 unigenes were annotated. Our data constitute a preliminary basis for further studies on flower development of Canna indica.

DESIGN
The two samples from flower primordium and differentiated flower were sequenced for transcriptome assembly, and gene expression information of the two stages was also obtained from these data.
