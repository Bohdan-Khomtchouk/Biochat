TITLE
Reprogramming human fat cells into iPS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study determined whether human adipose stem cells (hASCs) could be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using the 4 factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC. We showed successfull reprogramming could be achieved in which fat/adipose cells were able to assume embryonic-like phenotypes after lentiviral transduction with the 4 factors. Further, we believe these fat cells are intrinsically better-suited for reprogramming compared to fibroblasts, and result in higher yields of iPS cells.

DESIGN
Microarray study was performed in duplicates (hASCs, iPS cells derived from hASCs, and hESCs). Reference control was pooled RNA taken from H9 hESCs, embryoid bodies, and some differentiated cell types such as endothelial cells.
