TITLE
Serial Analysis of Gene Expression molecular signature for disease progression in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy. While it carries a median survival of less than 3 years its rate of progression varies widely between patients. We hypothesized that studying the gene expression profiles of physiologically stable patients and those in which the disease progressed rapidly after the initial diagnosis would aid in the search for biomarkers and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis.
