TITLE
Identification of Embryonic Pancreatic Genes using Xenopus DNA Microarrays

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The pancreas is an exocrine and endocrine endodermal organ involved in digestion and glucose homeostasis.  During embryogenesis, the anlagen of the pancreas arise from dorsal and ventral evaginations of the foregut that later fuse to form a single organ.  In order to better understand the molecular genetics of early pancreas development, we sought to isolate markers that are uniquely expressed in this tissue.  Microarray analysis was performed comparing dissected pancreatic buds, liver buds, and the stomach region of tadpole stage Xenopus embryos.  A total of 912 genes were found to be differentially expressed between these organs during early stages of organogenesis.  K-means clustering analysis predicted 120 of these genes to be specifically enriched in the pancreas. Of these, we report on the novel expression patterns of 24 genes.  Among them, STXBP6 and KIRREL2 were expressed by the early tailbud stage, suggesting the possible involvement of novel signaling pathways in early pancreas development.
