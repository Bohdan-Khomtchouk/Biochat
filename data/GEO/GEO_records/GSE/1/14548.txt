TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Tumor Microenvironment during Breast Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of tumor microenvironment in breast cancer progression, we combined laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis to provide a comprehensive catalog of gene expression changes in both tumor and tumor-associated stroma. Keywords: cancer vs. normal
