TITLE
Culex quinquefasciatus Jpal-per strain vs. Ogasawara strain

ORGANISM
Culex quinquefasciatus

SUMMARY
A pyrethroid-resistant strain of Culex quinquefasciatus, JPal-per, exhibits 2500-fold greater larval resistance to permethrin than the insecticide-susceptible strain Ogasawara. An increased microsome monooxygenase metabolism is involved in the resistance mechanism. Microarray analysis revealed altered expressions of cytochrome P450 genes in the fourth instar larvae of JPal-per compared to those in OGS. An oligo DNA array was designed for 62 different cDNA segments encoding unique P450 isoforms of the Cx. pipiens complex. Other probes for non-P450 Cx. pipiens complex genes were also mounted on the array.

DESIGN
Two strains with two color experiment, total 10 replicates, 5 biological replicates (each strain), 5 dye-swap experiments.
