TITLE
Expression profile of PITX2 overexpressed HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PITX2 is a homeodomain transcription factor that has a substantial role in cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. In this study we have characterized PITX2-regulating genes. These data provide an insightful perspective for further studying PITX2 function and mechanism of action.
