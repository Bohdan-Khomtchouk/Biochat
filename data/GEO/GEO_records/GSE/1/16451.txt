TITLE
Human BE(2)-C neuronal responses to WEEV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human neuronal differentiation alters responsiveness to innate immune stimuli and virus infections. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional responses of the human BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cell line to infection with western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV).

DESIGN
Cultured BE(2)-C cells were differentiated with 10 uM all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for 3 weeks and infected with WEEV at an MOI=10 for 6 h, and Affymetrix Human Genome Array U133 Plus 2.0 chips were used to analyze transcript levels.
