TITLE
Gene expression in striatums of Foxp2-hum, Foxp2-ko and wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been proposed that two amino acid substitutions in the transcription factor FOXP2 have been positively selected during human evolution due to effects on aspects of speech and language. Here, we introduce these substitutions into the endogenous Foxp2 gene.of mice. Although these mice are generally healthy, they have qualitatively different ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased exploratory behavior and decreased dopamine concentrations in the brain suggesting an effect of the humanized Foxp2 allele on basal ganglia. In the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia that is affected in humans with a speech deficit due to one non-functional FOXP2 allele, we find that medium spiny neurons have increased dendrite lengths and increased synaptic plasticity. Since mice carrying one non-functional Foxp2 allele show opposite effects, this suggests that alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits might have been important for the evolution of speech and language in humans. In this particular experiment, we investigate the effects of human Foxp2 (Foxp2hum) and the non-functional Foxp2 allele on striatal gene expression in embryonic, young and adult mice.
