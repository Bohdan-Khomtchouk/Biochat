TITLE
Pilot-study for a novel universal tool for detection of oncogenic fusion transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A novel oligonucleotide microarray design is described whereby one can screen for all known oncogenic fusion transcripts by one microarray hybridization. Measurements of chimeric transcript junctions are combined with exon-wise measurements of individual fusion partners. Keywords: Nimblegen custom-design
