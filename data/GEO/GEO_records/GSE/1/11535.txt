TITLE
Expression profiles of MicroRNA and SiRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and transgenic plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of MicroRNA and SiRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and transgenic plants with constitutive expression of the chimeric receptors NRG1 grown at different temperature To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of de-cosuppression with memory by high temperature in Arabidopsis, we performed the expression profiles of microRNA and SiRNA in transgenic plants with constitutive expression of the chimeric receptors NRG1 and wide type Col-0 grown at different temperature using the Custom LC Sciences Arabidopsis microRNA and SiRNA array. Keywords: high temperature, de-cosuppression, MicroRNA, SiRNA
