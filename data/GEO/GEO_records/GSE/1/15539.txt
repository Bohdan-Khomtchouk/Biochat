TITLE
THP-1 cells infected with the clinical isolates of extensively drug-resistant and drug sensitive tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) showed many different characteristics including the extreme drug resistance versus the drug sensitive clinical isolates (DS-TB), to know better about the reasons we used the tuberculosis host cells named as THP-1  (one kind of the macrophage cells) to be infected by the XDR-TB and DS-TB.DS strain A36 and the XDR strain B42 and was typical and selected by our lab. Then the total RNA of infected or uninfected THP-1 cells was extract and purified for the analysis by the chip (22K Human Genome chip representing the 21522 ORF of human with the oligonucleotide probe of 70 mer from CapitalBio Corp., Beijing, China). The results reflected the different expressed genes involved in apoptosis, secreted cytokines and signal pathway and so on. Those results might indicate the how the XDR-TB cause the pathogenesis.
