TITLE
Hepatic gene expression before and during interferon and ribavirin combination therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients who cleared HCV viremia early during therapy tended to show favorable outcomes, whereas patients who needed a longer period to clear HCV had poorer outcomes. We explored the mechanisms of treatment resistance by comparing hepatic gene expression before and during treatment

DESIGN
We explored the mechanisms of treatment resistance by comparing hepatic gene expression before and during treatment. Liver biopsy was performed in 30 patients before and one week after starting combination therapy with IFN + Rib. Hepatocytes and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes (LILs) were obtained from 12 patients using laser capture micro dissection (LCM).
