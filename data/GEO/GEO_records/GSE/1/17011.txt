TITLE
Characterisation of the NRF2-mediated anti-oxidant gene battery by transcriptional profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in HACAT cells using a whole human genome array HACAT cells treated with si RNA against Keap 1 or a scrambled si RNA sequence (Scram) vs HACAT cells mock transfected with lipofectamine (reference control)

DESIGN
2 biological replicates, 2 technical (dye swap) replicates per treatment.
