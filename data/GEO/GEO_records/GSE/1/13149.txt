TITLE
Multi-stage analysis of gene expression in C57/B6 mouse liver development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The liver performs a number of essential functions for life. The development of such a complex organ relies on finely regulated gene expression profiles which change over time in the development and determine the phenotype and function of the liver. We used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to study the gene expression and transcription regulation at 14 time points across the C57/B6 mouse liver development, which include E11.5 (embryonic day 11.5), E12.5, E13.5, E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, E17.5, E18.5, Day0 (the day of birth), Day3, Day7, Day14, Day21, and normal adult liver. With these data, we made a comprehensive analysis on gene expression patterns, functional preferences and transcriptional regulations during the liver development. Keywords: time course
