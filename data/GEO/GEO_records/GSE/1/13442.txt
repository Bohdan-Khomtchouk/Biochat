TITLE
Blood gene expression of rats exposed to acetaminophen or methyl parathion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether expression of specific genes in peripheral blood can be used as surrogate marker(s) to detect and distinguish target organ-specific chemical toxicity in rats.  Rats were intraperitoneally administered a single, acute dose of a well-established hepatotoxic (acetaminophen) or neurotoxic (methyl parathion) chemical. Administration of acetaminophen (AP) or methyl parathion (MP) in the rats resulted in hepatotoxicity as evidenced from elevated blood transaminase activities or neurotoxicity as evidenced from the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity in the blood, respectively. Microarray analysis of the global gene expression profile of rat blood identified distinct gene expression markers capable of detecting and distinguishing hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity induced by AP and MP, respectively. Differential expressions of the marker genes specific for hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity were detectable in the blood much earlier than the appearance of the commonly used clinical markers, serum transaminases and acetyl cholinesterase. In summary, our results demonstrated that blood gene expression markers can detect and distinguish target organ toxicity non-invasively and with higher sensitivity than traditional surrogate markers.
