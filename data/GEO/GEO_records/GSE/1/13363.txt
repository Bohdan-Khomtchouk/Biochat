SUMMARY
Hepatoblasts emerging at E8.5 from the foregut endoderm proliferate vigorously and differentiate to hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. To find genes important for hepatocyte differentiation during development, we compared gene expression profiles of hepatoblasts/immature hepatocytes at E12.5 and E17.5.  As Dlk, also known as Pref-1, is expressed in hepatoblasts/immature hepatocytes, we performed a microarray analysis of the Dlk+ cells isolated from livers at E12.5 and E17.5. Keywords: fetal liver cells comparing
