TITLE
Role of Manganese Efflux for Signaling and Pathogenesis in Streptococcus pneumonia

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 transcriptome in response to manganese as the transcriptome changes in response to intracellular manganese accumulation via a mutation in sp1552/mntE a manganese efflux protein.
