TITLE
Expression data from an involution time course in wild type and E2F3 +/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have compared an involution timecourse for wild type and E2F3 heterozygous mice on the Operon 3.0 platform.  Three mice were taken for each genotype at each timepoint (Involution day 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) and RNA was prepared from the mammary glands.  The RNA from each mouse was pooled and run as an individual sample. Keywords: Mouse Mammary Gland RNA
