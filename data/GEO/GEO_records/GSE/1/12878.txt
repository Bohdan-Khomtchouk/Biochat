TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli after addition of CO-RMs to anaerobically growing cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown to mid-log phase in defined anaerobic media. One sample was treated with 100 µM CORM-3, the other sample was a control. The volume (175 ml), temperature (37oC) and stirring (200 rpm) were constant. After 15 min of exposure to CO-RM, samples were taken from treated and control cells, harvested into ice cold phenol ethanol (187 µl phenol, 3.56 ml ethanol) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by suppliers. RNA was quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). Biological experiments were carried out four times, and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing two technical repeats for each of the four biological repeats.
