TITLE
Differential gene expression in prefrontal cortex from mice subject to social threat vs. control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on prefrontal cortex mRNA samples collected from 10 animals subject to repeated social threat (pooled into 2 groups of 5) and 10 animals subject to non-threatening control conditions (pooled into 2 groups of 5).  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in prefrontal cortex tissue from animals exposed to social threat vs non-threatening control conditions. Keywords: Risk prediction

DESIGN
RNA from 5 mice/sample was pooled to generate 4 total samples: 2 from mice subject to repeated social threat, and 2 from control mice.
