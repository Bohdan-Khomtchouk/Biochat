TITLE
Gene expression changes in As4.1 cells during treatment with interleukin (IL) or hydrogen peroxide (HP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As4.1 cells are a renin-expressing cell line commonly used to study the molecular regulation of the mouse renin gene.  In the present study, the global gene expression profile was assessed in these cells under control conditions (VEHICLE) and after treatment with interleukin (IL) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), both of which negatively regulate mouse renin gene expression.
