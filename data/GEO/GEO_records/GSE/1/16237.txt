TITLE
Expression data of human neuroblastoma tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The prognosis of the patients with neuroblastoma largely depends on the biological characterisitics. Neuroblastoma tissues obtained before any treatments were analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix array. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression distinguishing tumor biology of neuroblastoma tisses from the prognosis of the patients.

DESIGN
51 neuroblastoma samples were selected those resected from the patients who died of tumor progression and those whose tumor regressed or matured spontaneously. Total RNA was extracted from these tissues samples and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain genes to distinguish unfavorable tumors from favorable tumors.
