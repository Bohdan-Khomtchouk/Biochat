TITLE
Down-regulation of MYC and TP63 in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This transcriptome study is intended to discover the effects of MYC and TP63 on human keratinocytes differentiation at the genome level.

DESIGN
Human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells were transfected by siRNAs with the help of transfection reagent, INTERFERin. 48 hours post-transfection, total RNA was extracted from cells. We used a non-targeting siRNA as a negative control. siRNA targeting MYC or TP63 was obtained from QIAGEN, and RNAs from wild type HaCaT cells were used as reference samples. We did 3 biological replicates and 2 'dye swap' for each sample. Totally we got 12 samples, with 2 dye-swap for each sample, and 48 arrays used for all hybridization.
