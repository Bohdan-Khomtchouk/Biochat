SUMMARY
Pituitaries of basal and stressed Crhr1-wildtype (wt) and -knockout (ko) mice (Timpl et al., 1998) As the Crh-system and the HPA-axis are known to be crucially invovled in the onset, development and maintainance of psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression and regulate the behavioural and endocrine stress responses the further analysis of Crhr1-dependent signaling cascades is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms behind these psychiatric diseases. In this project, new candidate genes involved in Crhr1-dependent signaling cascades were dissected using metyrapone treated stressed Crhr1-wt and -ko (Timpl et al., 1998) mice using 30 min restraint stress. Changes in mRNA expression of pituitaries of basal and stressed Crhr1-wt and -ko mice were analysed 1 and 3h, respectively, after stress begin on the Sentrix Mouse-6 Expression BeadChip.
