TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under arsenate stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined the changes in gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana grown under arsenate stress.  The transcriptional profiling reveals antioxidant activity and repression of the phosphate starvation response. Keywords: dual label, stress response
