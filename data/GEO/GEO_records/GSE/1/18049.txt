TITLE
Widespread variation in transcript abundance within and across developmental stages of Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927

SUMMARY
Whole genome comparison of RNA levels for both protein coding genes and structural RNAs in five different life cycle stages: in vivo slender bloodstream form, in vivo stumpy bloodstream form, cultured bloodstream form, log-phase procyclic culture form and stationary-phase procyclic culture form

DESIGN
RNA from three independent biological replicates from five different life cycle stages were hybridized to Nimblegen arrays (Madison,WI USA) that contained 8 probes per open reading frame and 3 probes per structural RNA spotted three times per array
