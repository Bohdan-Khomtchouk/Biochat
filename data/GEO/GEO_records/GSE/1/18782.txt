TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) treatment [Exiqon miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lack of change in microRNA expression in adult mouse liver following treatment with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), as detected using Exiqon miRNA arrays. Adult male mice were exposed to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) or solvent for 3 days and sampled 4 hours after the last dose. MicroRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver were measured using Exiqon miRNA arrays. Our results indicate a distinct lack of effect of BaP of miRNA expression, despite widespread changes in mRNA levels (measured using Agilent arrays). Lack of miRNA changes was confirmed with Agilent miRNA arrays. Keywords: Toxicology, miRNA
