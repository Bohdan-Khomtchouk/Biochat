TITLE
Whole transcriptome sequencing data of GBSCC patients from India

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study has elucidated the immunoregulatory gene expression landscape in primary tumors of Gingivo-Buccal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, as compared to their adjacent normal tissue and computationally estimated a relative composition of various immune cell classes in those tissues. A detailed portrayal of expression variation of immune evasion genes alongwith other potential therapeutic targets have been highlighted in the study.

DESIGN
12 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal from same patient have been included in the study
