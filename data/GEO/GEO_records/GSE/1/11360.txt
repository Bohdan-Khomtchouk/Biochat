TITLE
Exon-level summary data from Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array was used to measure differential splicing patterns in archived RNA isolated from 26 of 80 children (11 Rejectors and 15 Non-Rejectors). The exon-level probe summaries reported in this series were computed using the Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) software and 'rma-sketch' normalization method. Keywords: Affymetrix 1.0 ST exon array; exon-level analysis
