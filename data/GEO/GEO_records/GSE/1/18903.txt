TITLE
Differentially expressed genes between MCF-7 and MCF-7-14 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the differentially expressed genes between MCF-7 and MCF-7-14, and estimated the similarities of expression profiles between MCF-7-14 and MDA-MB-231. We identified genes differentially expressed between non-invasive/non-metastatic and invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis as following design: MCF-7 versus MCF-7-14 versus MDA-MB-231 cells.
