TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of C2C12 Myoblast Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, the C2C12 cell line, a model used to study myogenesis and regeneration, was allowed to differentiate from myoblast precursor cells to myotubes. Cells were harvested at 4 different timepoints to perform gene expression profiling. We identified genes that were up-regulated and down-regulated during the differentiation process.

DESIGN
C2C12 Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into myotubes. Cells at different timepoints were harvested for gene expression profiling. Cells from the myoblasts stage, the start of differentiation, 24h after the start of differentiation and myotubes (96h after start of differentiation) were harvested. Myotubes were detatched from the undifferentiated myoblast reserve cells using diluted trypsin. 3 independent biological replicates per timepoint were submitted to gene expression profiling.
