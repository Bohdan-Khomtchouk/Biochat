TITLE
Similarity of Gene Expression Patterns in Human Alveolar Macrophages in Response to P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if differences in the severity of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis been seen in late isolates od Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia are associated with differences in the initial repsonse of alveolar macrophages (AM) to these pathogens, we assessed gene expression changes in human AM in response to infection with a laboratoty strain, early and late clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, and B. cepacia. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression in alveolar macrophages of normal non-smokers and normal smokers.
