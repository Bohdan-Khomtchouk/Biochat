TITLE
A simple optimization can improve the performance of single feature polymorphism detection by Affymetrix expression array: Transcript and Genome Hybridizations

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The publicly available genome sequence information of two rice strains, japonica cultivar Nipponbare and indica cultivar 93-11, opens a great opportunity for investigation of performances DNA genotyping by high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Here, we compare single feature polymorphism (SFP) detection performances between whole genome hybridization and transcript hybridization using Affymetrix Rice Expression Array and the two rice cultivars.
