TITLE
Gene Expression in Blood in Scizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are polygenic disorders with many genes contributing to their etiologies. The aim of this investigation was to search for dysregulated molecular and cellular pathways for these disorders as well as psychosis. We conducted a blood-based microarray investigation in two independent samples with SCZ and BPD from San Diego (SCZ=13, BPD=9, control=8) and Taiwan [data not included](SCZ=11, BPD=14, control=16). Diagnostic groups were compared to controls, and subjects with a history of psychosis [PSYCH(+): San Diego (n=6), Taiwan (n=14)] were compared to subjects without such history [PSYCH(-): San Diego (n=11), Taiwan (n=14)]. Analyses of covariance comparing mean expression levels on a gene-by-gene basis were conducted to generate the top 100 significantly dysregulated gene lists for both samples by each diagnostic group. Gene lists were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Results showed the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPS) was listed in the top ten canonical pathways for BPD and psychosis diagnostic groups across both samples with a considerably low likelihood of a chance occurrence (p = .001). No overlap in dysregulated genes populating these pathways was observed between the two independent samples. Findings provide preliminary evidence of UPS dysregulation in BPD and psychosis as well as support further investigation of the UPS and other molecular and cellular pathways for potential biomarkers for SCZ, BPD, and/or psychosis. The aim of this investigation was to search for dysregulated molecular and cellular pathways for these disorders as well as psychosis.

DESIGN
Blood-based microarray investigation in two independent samples with SCZ and BPD from San Diego (SCZ=13, BPD=9, control=8).
