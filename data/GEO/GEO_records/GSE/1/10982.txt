TITLE
Gene expression profiling of colorectal cancers to understand molecular changes and clinicopathological features

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analyzed in terms of canonical molecular changes and clinicopathological features to elucidate alternative or subordinate pathways during colorectal tumorigenesis and tumor growth. Eighty-four sporadic colorectal cancer patients, standardized by tumor location, were consecutively enrolled. Representative molecular changes including APC, TP53, Wnt, RAF, and mismatch repair defect (MMR) were recorded for each sample. Keywords: disease state analysis; sub-type analysis within colorectal cancers
