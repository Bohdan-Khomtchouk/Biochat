TITLE
Peripheral blood biomarker signatures for acute kidney transplant rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present work, we have used whole genome expression profiling of peripheral blood samples from 51 patients with biopsy-proven acute kidney transplant rejection and 24 patients with excellent function and biopsy-proven normal transplant histology. The results demonstrate that there are 1738 probesets on the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip representing 1472 unique genes which are differentially expressed in the peripheral blood during an acute kidney transplant rejection. By ranking these results we have identified minimal sets of 50 to 150 probesets with predictive classification accuracies for AR of greater than 90% established with several different prediction tools including DLDA and PAM. We have demonstrated that a subset of peripheral blood gene expression signatures can also diagnose four different subtypes of AR (Banff Borderline, IA, IB and IIA) and the top 100 ranked classifiers have greater than 89% predictive accuracy. Finally, we have demonstrated that there are gene signatures for early and late AR defined as less than or greater than one year post-transplant with greater than 86% predictive accuracies. We also confirmed that there are 439 time-independent gene classifiers for AR. Based on these results, we conclude that peripheral blood gene expression profiling can be used to diagnose AR at any time in the first 5 years post-transplant in the setting of acute kidney transplant dysfunction not caused by BK nephropathy, other infections, drug-induced nephrotoxicity or ureteral obstruction.

DESIGN
Microarray profiles of peripheral blood from 51 biopsy-proven acute kidney rejection (AR) and 24 well-functioning kidney transplants were randomized and compared using class comparisons, network and biological function analyses.
