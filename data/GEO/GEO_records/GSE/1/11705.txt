TITLE
Induction of adaptive changes in the Streptococcus agalactiae transcriptome by human blood

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
In the present investigation, we conducted a bacterial transcriptome dynamics analysis during GBS incubation with human blood. We observed a large modification in the expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation and in the metabolism of carbohydrates, purins/pyrimidins and inorganic ions, and an up-regulation of genes involved in attachment and plasminogen contact. We also observed differences in the expression of GBS genes in blood at 40° relative to 37°C.
