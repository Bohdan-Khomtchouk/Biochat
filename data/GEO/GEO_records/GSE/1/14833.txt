TITLE
Expression data from different stages of hematopoietic cells development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
18 different population of cells in different developmental stages in hematopoietic hierarchy have been purifyed by FACS analyses from wild type C57Bl6 mice and subjected to Micrroarray Affymetrix mouse 430.2 platform We used microarrays to compare global expression pattern in different hematopoietic cell populations to reconstruct the whole hierarchy of hematopoietic tree based on gene profiling Keywords: Hematopoietic Development

DESIGN
For analysis of progenitor populations, RNA was extracted from 2000 purified adult BM cells using RNAeasy microkit. RNA was labeled and amplified by dual amplification and hybridized to Affymetrix micro array u480A, according to AffymetrixTM GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Probe level expression values were calculated using RMA
