TITLE
Expression data after Dmrt2a brief overexpression at bud-stage zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We used the Dmrt2a inducible transgenic line Tg(hsp70:HA-dmrt2a) to do a brief dmrt2a overexpression at bud-stage in order to identify Dmrt2a immediate targets and understand its mechanism of action. Both wildtype and transgenic embryos received the same treatment. Zebrafish embryos were collected between 2 hours and 2 hours 30 minutes after heat-shock (Dmrt2a overexpression) and were microdissected in two regions: Region 1 (contains the somites and all associated tissues) and Region 2 (contains the tailbud, Kupffer's Vesicle and all associated tissues)

DESIGN
We selected 100 pieces from Region 1 and 100 pieces from Region 2. We used three biological replicates. We compared the transgenics samples with control samples within Region 1 and within Region 2, in separate. We selected genes with a fold change higer than 2 or lower than -2. We selected p-values lower than 5% and FDR lower than 5%.
