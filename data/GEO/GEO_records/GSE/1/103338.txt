TITLE
Depletion of Mob1a/b causes intestinal epithelia degeneration by suppressing Wnt and activating BMP/TgfÎ² signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the cause of defects in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) homeostasis and acute death of IECs specific Mob1a/b double knockout mice, microarray analysis with isolated IECs was performed.

DESIGN
Gene expression in IECs was measured at 0, 4 and 7days after conditional knockout of Mob1a/b in 8 week old mice. IECs were isolated from proximal region of intestine using 2mM EDTA/PBS solution. This experiment was performed using two different male mice at each time (0, 4 or 7days).
