TITLE
The expression profiles of chicken ileum

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used two different chermostat products and sterilized water to inoculate chicks, and then detect the expression profiles affected by the different inoculation.

DESIGN
Three probes for each of the 55366 genes(4126 Refseq genes and 51240 predicted genes) and 3259 random probes were designed and every slide have two blocks. 9 samples were used to analysis and 6 samples had two replications.
