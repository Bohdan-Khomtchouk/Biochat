TITLE
Sequencing of rice degradome

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
miRNAs can regulate target gene expression by mRNA cleavage. Rice degradome sequencing was employed to validate mRNA targets of rice miRNAs.

DESIGN
Two rice samples, 3-week-old seedling and young panicles were included in the study.
