TITLE
ChIP-chip of PolII in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. This Series contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: PolII at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Note: 8wg16 is the name of PolII antibody for set2 datasets.
