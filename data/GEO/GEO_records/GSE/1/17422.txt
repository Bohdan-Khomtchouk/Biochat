TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the Borrelia burgdorferi bb0647 mutant

ORGANISM
Borrelia burgdorferi B31

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from late-log pahse wild-type Borrelia burgdorferi B31 and the bb0647 mutant grown in BSKH media at 37 degree, 5% CO2. cDNA was synthesized, labeled and hybridized to the 70mer oligonucleotide B. burgdorferi array. Slides were scanned using axon scanner and image were analyzed using GenePix 6.0. Dta were further analysed using the professional software Acuity 4.o, based on a ratio-based normalization.
