TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the pre-globular stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected pre-globular stage seed compartments from 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of seeds containing pre-globular-stage embryos was identified as those seeds containing embryo propers made up of  between 2 and 8 cells. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embyro proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and general seed coat. Serial sections of entire seeds were also captured for comparison. Keywords: cell type comparison
