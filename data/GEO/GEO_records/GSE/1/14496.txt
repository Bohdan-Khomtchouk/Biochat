TITLE
A combinatorial Interplay Among the ACC Synthase Isoforms Regulates Ethylene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ACC Synthase (ACS) is the key regulatory enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis in plants. It catalyzes the conversion of s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene. Arabidopsis has nine ACS genes. The goal of the project is to inactivate each gene by insertional mutagenesis and amiRNA technology and eventually construct a null ACS mutant. We have been recently able to achieve this goal. Furthermore, we wanted to know how inactivation of individual ACS genes affects global gene expression. Keywords: ACS mutant comprrison; global gene expression.
