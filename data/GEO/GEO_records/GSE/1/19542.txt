TITLE
HIRA null vs parental mES cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hira has been implicated in replication-independent chromatin assembly. To determine the role of Hira in the regulation of embryonic stem (ES) cell gene expression, we used microarrays to analyze the global program of gene expression in Hira null versus WT undifferentiated ES cells.
