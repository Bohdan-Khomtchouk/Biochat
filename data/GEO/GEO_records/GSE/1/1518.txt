TITLE
Human endothelium exposed to shear stress and pressure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intact living conduit vessels (umbilical veins) were exposed to normal or high intraluminal pressure, or low or high shear stress in combination with a physiological level of the other force. We used a unique vascular ex vivo perfusion system. After six hours of perfusion endothelial cells were isolated from the stimulated vessels and RNA was extracted. RNA from 16 experiments from each stimulation were pooled and analyzed in duplicate DNA microarrays. Keywords: repeat sample
