TITLE
Diversity amongst trigeminal neurons revealed by high throughput single cell sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNA-seq was performed on the mouse trigmeminal ganglia.

DESIGN
Trigeminal ganglia from mice were dissociated into single cell and scRNA-seq were carried out using the Drop-seq method.
