TITLE
Gene expression in the hippocampus of Mef2c-HET mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of Mef2c-het mice vs. WT littermates in hippocampus Total RNA isolated from hippocampus of P1 and P30 aged Mef2c-HET and WT mice using QIAGEN miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN; Cat #217004) were processed on an Illumina mouse Ref8 v2 beadchip microarrays following the manufactureâ€™s protocol.  Microarray data analysis was performed using R and Bioconductor packages. Raw expression data were log2 transformed and normalized by quantile normalization. Probes were considered robustly expressed if the detection P value was 0.01 for at least half of the samples in the data set.

DESIGN
Hippocampus of P1 and P30 aged Mef2c-HET and WT mice were used for the study
