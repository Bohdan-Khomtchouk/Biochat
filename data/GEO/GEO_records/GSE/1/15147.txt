TITLE
Transient Genotype-by-Environment Interactions in the Yeast Genomic Expression Response to Heat Shock

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarray time courses followed the response of 5 yeast strains to heat shock.  Expression variation due to genetic, environmental, and genotype-by-environment interactions were identified. Keywords: Timecourse and single timepoint expression studies of stress response in yeast

DESIGN
The genomic expression response to heat shock was measured in 5 different yeast strains over the course of 2 hours. Basal expression at 25C was also compared in 4 non-lab strains to the S288c refernce. All experiments were done in duplicate, for a total of 68 Samples.
