TITLE
Aberrant gene expression in Drosophila hybrids supporting faster-male evolution

ORGANISM
Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
To explore the aberrant expression patterns between hybrid sexes, we compare the global gene expression of 7-day-old whole body adults of hybrids by sex in recently diverged  Drosophia pseudoobscura group
