TITLE
Profiling gene expression in HeLa cells following TFEB transient transfection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples from three biological replicates in which TFEB was transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells by transfection using a pcDNA3 vector. As negative control, we used total RNA samples from HeLa cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector.

DESIGN
TFEB transfection
