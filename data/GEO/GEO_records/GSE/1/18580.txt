TITLE
sRNAs in Rhizobium etli differentially expressed during free-living and host-associated growth

ORGANISM
Rhizobium etli CFN 42

SUMMARY
89 small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were identified in the soil-dwelling alpha-proteobacterium Rhizobium etli by comparing an extensive compilation of ncRNA predictions to intergenic expression data of a whole-genome tiling array. The differential expression levels of some of these ncRNAs during free-living growth and during interaction with the eukaryotic host plant may indicate a role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
