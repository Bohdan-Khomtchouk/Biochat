Effects on small RNA MgrR in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
MgrR is a newly characterized Hfq dependent small RNA RNA.  The expression of MgrR is regulated by Two component system, PhoPQ regulon, which senses low Mg2+ in environment. It has been reported that  Hfq-binding sRNAs base pair with target RNAs, frequently leading to rapid degradation of target messages or, less frequently, to stabilization, both of which can be assayed by using microarrays.  In order to search for the target genes of MgrR, we therefore examined the consequences of MgrR expression on mRNA abundance under two conditions.  In condition 1, the chromosomal copy of mgrR was deleted and MgrR was expressed for 15â€™ from an induced plac-mgrR plasmid and compared to cells carrying a vector induced for the same period.  In condition 2, the expression of mRNAs was compared in wild-type cells (mgrR+) and the mgrR deletion strain, both grown in LB; because MgrR levels are fairly high under our normal growth conditions, this allowed analysis of both the direct and indirect (long-term) effects of MgrR.
