TITLE
Gene expression analysis of primitive neuroectodermal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS PNET) and medulloblastomas are both embryonal tumors that predominantly occur in children. We used microarrays to analyse a cohort of CNS PNETs and medulloblastomas to identify gene expression related to tumor subgroups.
