TITLE
Expression profiling of BORIS knockout mice testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes in Boris KO testis, gene expression profilings were performed with NIAID mouse customized arrays. Gene expressions of five biological replicates of Boris KO testis were compared to those of wild type testis.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from WT and BORIS KO testes prepared from P14 mice were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. Five sets of each genotype were studied.
