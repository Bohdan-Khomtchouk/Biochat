SUMMARY
This series represents murine dorsal neural tube bisected along the midline with one half from each embryo used for control and the other half treated with 10-6M RA dissolved in ethanol for 6, 12, 24 or 48 h. For 6 h exposures, the explants were cultured overnight on fibronectin coated 35mm dishes (Biocoat, Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) in DMEM with 10% horse serum in order to allow for sufficient outgrowth of neural crest cells. The RA was added the following morning; RMA Express 0.2 used to initially normalize data; GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Inc.) used for subsequent analysis Samples were analyzed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Keywords = neural crest Keywords = microarray Keywords = retinoic acid Keywords = gene expression Keywords = cell signaling Keywords = cell proliferation Keywords: time-course
