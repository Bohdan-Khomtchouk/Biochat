TITLE
Depletion of Erk1 and Erk2 MAP kinases in primary human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the effect of RNAi-mediated MAP kinase cascade signaling blockade in primary human keratinocytes.  Two sets of siRNA targeting different regions of the Erk1/2 genes were used, enabling identification of off-target siRNA effects.
