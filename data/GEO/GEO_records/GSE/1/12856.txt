TITLE
Penetration resistance: Wildtype and ataf1-1 mutant response to Bgh 12 h after inoculation, 2*2 factorial design

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis is a non-host to the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh), effectively hindering Bgh ingress to the epidermal cells by deposition of callosic papillae formations, i.e. penetration resistance. To better understand the transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis towards Bgh, we compared un-inoculated and inoculated wild-type Arabidopsis samples, with those an ATAF1 mutant allele, compromised in penetration resistance. The experiment included sampling of 8 rosettes for each replicate sample from 6-weeks old plants, 12 hrs after inoculation. A total of 12 biolocigal replicates were sampled with three replicates from each of the four blocks (Wild-type, ataf1-1, Bgh, control).   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Michael Krogh Jensen.
