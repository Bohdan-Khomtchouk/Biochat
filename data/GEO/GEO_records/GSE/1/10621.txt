TITLE
Prostaglandin E2 Receptor Subtype EP2- and EP4-regulated Gene Expression Profiling in Human Ciliary Smooth Muscle Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes of genome-wide mRNA transcription levels of human ciliary smooth muscle (hCSM) cells were determined by treating hCSM cells in culture with 200 nM of either an prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP2 or subtype EP4 selective agonist for 6 hours in comparison to untreated controls. This was followed by competitive hybridization of fluorescent Cy3 or Cy5 labeled cRNA probes derived from the treated versus untreated control total RNA samples onto an Agilent Human Whole Genome Expression oligonucleotide microarray. Log 2 (LN) of the intra-slide ratios (RATIO, PRE_VALUE) of treated versus untreated samples was reported as VALUE in the sample files. Keywords: prostaglandin E2 receptor agonists, subtype EP2, subtype EP4, hCSM
