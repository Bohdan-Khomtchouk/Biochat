TITLE
Expression data from donor lungs of cardiac death and brain death donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung donation after cardiac death (DCD), in contrast to donation after brain death (DBD), is a promising and increasingly common method to help relieve the shortage of donor organs. However, the pathogenetic consequences of retrieved lungs after DCD vs. DBD have not been clarified. We aimed to study the differential gene expression profiles in lungs of DCD and DBD patients.

DESIGN
DCD patients were matched with DBD lung transplant cases from a prospectively maintained database. The number of tissue samples included in this study was 6 pre- and 5 post-transplant in DCD and 12 pre- and 12 post-transplant in DBD for a total number of 35 lung tissue samples.
