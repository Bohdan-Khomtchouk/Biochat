TITLE
The small RNA profile in wildtype, R2D2 and loquacious mutant Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used SOLiD technology to deep sequence libraries prepared from 18-35 nt PAGE purfied small RNAs  derived from female Drosophila. The objective of our study was to compare the impact of R2D2 or loquacious mutantions on different small RNA populations in the fruit fly.

DESIGN
We deep sequenced three separate libraries derived from a wildtype reference, R2D2 and loquacious mutant Drosophila.
