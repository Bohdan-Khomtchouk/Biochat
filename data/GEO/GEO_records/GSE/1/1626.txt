TITLE
Testing for gene expression differences between chromosomally stable and unstable isogenic clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An irradiated but chromosomally stable CHO clone RT210B was used a reference to find differences in gene expression compared to radiation-induced chromosomally unstable isogenic clones.  Equal quantities of two unstable different unstable clones were mixed prior to RNA extraction.  Each mixture was tested twice versus the stable reference clone.  Two different two clone mixtures were tested against the same chromosomally stable clone Keywords: repeat sample
