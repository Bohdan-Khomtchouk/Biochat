TITLE
Expression data from uterine endometrial tissues of Holstein-Friesian cows on days 14-16 after calving

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Most dairy cows suffer uterine microbial contamination postpartum. Persistent endometritis often develops, associated with reduced fertility. We used a model of differential feeding and milking regimes to produce cows in differing negative energy balance (NEB) status in early lactation. We used Affymetrix GeneChip√í Bovine Genome Array  to investigate  the global  gene expression underlying  negative energy balance and to  identify the significantly differentially expressed genes during this process.
