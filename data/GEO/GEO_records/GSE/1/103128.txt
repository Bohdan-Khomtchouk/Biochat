TITLE
Differential expression profile of mRNAs and lncRNAs regulated by HNF1α in hepatocellular carcinoma cells HuH7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the role of HNF1α on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the overall mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma, we analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in huh7 cells with overexpression or knockdown of HNF1α. Expression profile showed that there were 339 mRNAs and 22 intergenic lncRNAs positively regulated by HNF1α for more than 2 times. The up-regulated genes separated samples by comparing lenti-HNF1α group with lenti-ctrl group, with overlap the down-regulated genes separated in HNF1α knockdown groups were identified as the genes positived regulated by HNF1α. Expression of seven genes from these 22 intergenic lncRNAs was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the regulatory effect of HNF1α on lncRNAs as well as the microarray analysis pattern.

DESIGN
HuH7 cells were infected with lentivirus which carrying HNF1α or shHNF1α with their control group, respectively. The total RNA of four groups (lenti-ctrl, lenti-HNF1α, lenti-shNC, lenti-shHNF1α) was measured by microarray at 6 days after HuH7 cells infected with lentivirus. And then we analyzed the mRNAs expression profile and lncRNAs expression profile, respectively.
