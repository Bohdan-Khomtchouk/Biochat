TITLE
Microarray Experiments for mice lacking or with  the Stat5a and 5b genes in blood cells that were treated w/o CMP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GM-CSF controls the development of granulocytes but little is known about the contribution of the downstream mediating transcription factor STAT5A/B.  To elucidate this pathway, we generated mice lacking the Stat5a and 5b genes in blood cells.  Peripheral neutrophils were decreased and administration of 5-FU and GM-CSF failed to induce granulopoiesis in Stat5a/b-mutant mice. CMPs were isolated and cultured with GM-CSF.
