TITLE
Small RNAs in Arabidopsis hybrid siliques

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Five days post-fertilization siliques were collected for RNA extraction. After purification, small RNA libraries were generated for high throughput sequencing. Resulting sequences were analyzed to determine the contribution of the paternal genome to the small RNA transcriptome. Keywords: Epigenetics

DESIGN
4 unique samples. small RNAs purified from Arabidopsis siliques 5 days after pollination. Samples were selfed or hybrid crosses between ecotypes Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler).
