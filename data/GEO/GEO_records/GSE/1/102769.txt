TITLE
Effect of CBL0137 on gene expression in FACT positive and negative organs of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CBL0137 is chromatin destabilizing agent, which causing trapping of FACT histone chaperone in chromatin (Gasparian et all, Science TM, 2011, Safina et all, NAR, 2017). We compared effect of CBL0137 on gene expression in mouse organs, expressing FACT (testes, spleen ) or not (lung, liver) to figure out what effects of CBL0137 is due to the inhibition of FACT and which are independent of FACT.

DESIGN
NIH Swiss mice, male, 7 weeks old were treated with three doses of CBL0137, once via IV, 30, 60 and 90 mg/kg. Vehicle was 5% dextrose. Organs were collected 24 hours after treatment, n=2.
