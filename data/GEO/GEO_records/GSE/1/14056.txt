TITLE
Co-immunoprecipitation of RNAs with RNA helicase A (RHA)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Given that RHA regulates translation by binding a PCE located at the 5â€™ UTR of the target transcripts a genome-wide screen was performed to identify mRNAs that bind RHA in vivo. The results from duplicate experiments with samples obtained in two independent RNA immunoprecipitations identified 407 transcripts that co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG RHA. Keywords: gene expression array-based
