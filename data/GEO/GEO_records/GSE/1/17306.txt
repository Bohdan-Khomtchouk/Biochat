TITLE
Plasma cells from 52 patients with multiple myeloma: mRNA and miRNA expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray analyses of patient myeloma cells (n=52) to correlate individual miRNA expression profiles with GEP-based risk defined by mRNA expression profilesx as well as clinical features of the disease. Unlike for mRNAs, genome-wide elevation of miRNA expression patterns were significantly positively associated with a mRNA-based GEP-risk score (P < .01) and proliferation index (P < .05). Consistent with our observation of global deregulation of miRNA expression profiles, silencing EIF2C2/AGO2, a gene component of the mRNA-based high-risk signature and a master regulator of the genesis and functionality of all miRNAs, dramatically decreased viability in myeloma cell lines.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiling: We performed protein-coding gene expression profiles of myeloma cells from newly diagnosed patients with different molecularly defined disease types. miRNA expression profiling: We used microarray analyses of patient myeloma cells (n=52) to correlate individual miRNA expression profiles with GEP-based risk defined by mRNA expression profiles as well as clinical features of the disease.
