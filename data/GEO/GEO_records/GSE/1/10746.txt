TITLE
Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (CIOM) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotherapy may cause DNA damage within the oral mucosa of cancer patients leading to mucositis, a dose-limiting side effect for effective cancer treatment. We used whole genome gene expression analysis to identify cellular damage to the mucosal tissue occuring two days post induction chemotherapy and identified gene expression patterns that may or may not be predictive of oral mucositis. Keywords: Treatment effect
