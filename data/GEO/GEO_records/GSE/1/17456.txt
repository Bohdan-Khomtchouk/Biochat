TITLE
Identification of transcription factor EOR-1 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for EOR-1 at L3 stage, which plays important roles in regulating RAS/RAF-mediated signaling during excretory system development and RAS/RAF- and WNT-mediated signaling during P12 fate specification.
