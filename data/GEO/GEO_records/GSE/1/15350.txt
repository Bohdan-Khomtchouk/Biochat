TITLE
Resistance of primary ovarian cancer cells to oncolytic adenoviruses part1 of 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of primary ovarian cancer cells for resistance to viral oncolysis were investigated using Ad5/35.IR.E1A/TRAIL on clonal cultures derived from ovc316m cells. Part 1 of 2, initital study involving 5 clonal ovc316m cultures

DESIGN
Cells were infected for 8 days and cell survival determined by MTT assay. Uninfected control cells of each clonal culture were utilized for DNA expression arrays. SKOV3-ip1 cells were used for reference RNA in all samples.
