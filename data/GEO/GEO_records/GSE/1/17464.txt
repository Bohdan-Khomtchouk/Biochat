TITLE
Arabidopsis mutants treated with flg22, Alternaria brassicicola, Methyl jasmonate and Pst DC3000 bacteria

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gibberellin (GA) promotes plant growth by destabilizing DELLA proteins. DELLA proteins integrate multiple hormonal and environmental stress responses. We investigated the role of GA and DELLA proteins in plant defence. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression controlled by DELLA proteins and identified distinct classes of differentially regulated genes in response to pathogens, hormones or pathogen elicitors.
