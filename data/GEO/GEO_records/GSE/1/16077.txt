TITLE
Effects of far-infrared rays to human prostate cancer cell line PC-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Far-infrared rays activated DNA repair genes in human prostate cancer cells, PC-3, after 12days' exposure to far-infrared rays.  As a far-infrared rays emitter, synthetic/natural rubber (RB) was used. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,RB-treated  vs.non-RB-treated cells.: 2  reference control without RB,  independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
