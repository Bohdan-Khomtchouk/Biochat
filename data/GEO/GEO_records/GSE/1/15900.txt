TITLE
Diabetic lung

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Effect of type 1 diabetes (induced by streptozotocin 60 mg/kg) on lung gene expression.  Wistar rats, male.  At age 8 weeks control rats got IP buffer, diabetic rats got streptozotocin.  At age 12 weeks animals were anesthetized and lungs removed.  RNA was extracted with Trizol, and gene expression array analysis was performed using Affymetrix RAE 230A microarrays according to the directions from the manufacturer.  Arrays were scanned using a Hewlett Packard Gene Array scanner, and analyzed with Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software.  Expression levels reported are the output from the MAS software.

DESIGN
Control rats (n=5) vs diabetic rats (n=7) Each sample is from a different animal (thus these are biological replicates).  Samples were NOT pooled.  Thus each sample corresponds to one animal.
