TITLE
Myxococcus xanthus cells: wild-type vs. EBP mutant gene expression during development

ORGANISM
Myxococcus xanthus

SUMMARY
The mutants in our study carry an insertion in the nla4 (MXAN2516), nla6 (MXAN4042), nla18 (MXAN3692) or nla28 (MXAN1167) gene. (MXAN numbers are the conventional gene names; nlas are common names). Mutations in the nla genes produce strong defects in fruiting body development.  All four of the nla genes code for enhancer binding proteins (EBPs), which are transcriptional activators. In this study, we examined how the nla mutations alter gene expression patterns in developing cells.
