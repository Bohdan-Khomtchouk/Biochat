TITLE
Identification of genes controlled by LMX1B in the developing mouse hindlimb bud

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A control vs. genetic knockout experiment aimed at determining what RNAs are upregulated or downregulated in e11.5 mouse proximal limb tissue lacking the Lmx1b gene.  Because Lmx1b is required for dorsal-ventral patterning of the limb, this screen gives insight into what putative downstream targets of Lmx1b contribute to dorsal-ventral patterning. Keywords: Genetic allele comparison
