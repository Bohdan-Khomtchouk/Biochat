Transcription profiling of Arabidopsis plants infected with the Tobacco etch potyvirus TEV and the evolved TEV-At17, which was generated by serial passes of ancestral TEV in Arabidopsis. Infection with TEV-At17 cause severe symptoms in the plant, compared with the asymptomatic TEV-infection. Keywords: Virus infection
