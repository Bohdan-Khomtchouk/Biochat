TITLE
Expression profiles in two early developmental stages of Sparus aurata

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Two different early developmental stages of gilthead sea bream: i) larvae at 24 hours post-hatching ( Stage 1),  and ii) larvae at 96 hours post-hatching (Stage 4), were used for gene expression analysis. For each stage, total RNA was extracted from five (5) independent biological replicates, each consisting of pools of approximately 40-50 larvae. Based on SAM analysis, 1518 genes were differentially expressed between the two stages with a FDR (False Discovery Rate) of 0.0.
