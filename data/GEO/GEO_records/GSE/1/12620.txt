TITLE
Paramecium tetraurelia reciliation (log phase)

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
Paramecium cells in log-phase growth were treated for deciliation and total mRNA extracted at two time points after deciliation. This is usefull to study genes involved in cilia biogenesis. Time points are : T0 : mRNA extracted before deciliation. T30 : mRNA extracted 30 minutes after deciliation. T120 : mRNA extracted 120 minutes after deciliation.
