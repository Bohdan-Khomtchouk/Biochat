TITLE
ChIP-chip Designs to Interrogate the Xenopus Embryo Genome for Transcription Factor Binding and Epigenetic Regulation

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
Background: Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genome tile path microarrays or deep sequencing can be used to study genome-wide epigenetic profiles and the transcription factor binding repertoire. Although well studied in a variety of cell lines, these genome-wide profiles have so far been little explored in vertebrate embryos.   Principal findings: Here we report on two genome tile path ChIP-chip designs for interrogating the Xenopus tropicalis genome. In particular, a whole-genome microarray design was used to identify active promoters by close proximity to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation. A second microarray design features these experimentally derived promoter regions in addition to currently annotated 5â€™ ends of genes.   Conclusions: A whole-genome and a dedicated promoter microarray design was developed which can be used to study epigenetic phenomena and transcription factor binding in developing Xenopus embryos.
