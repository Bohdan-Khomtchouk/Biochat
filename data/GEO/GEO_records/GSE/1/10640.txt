TITLE
Specific, Durable and Accurate Gene Expression Signatures of Radiation Response in Mice and Humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous work has demonstrated the potential for peripheral blood (PB) gene expression profiling for the detection of disease or environmental exposures.    We have sought to determine the impact of several variables on the PB gene expression profile of an environmental exposure, ionizing radiation, and to determine the specificity of the PB signature of radiation versus other genotoxic stresses. Keywords: peripheral blood, gene expression study, radiation reponse
