TITLE
Expression data from androgen treated LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgens are required for the development of normal prostate, and they are also linked to the development of prostate cancer. We used microarrays to understand the role of androgen in an androgen dependent, androgen receptor (AR) positive human metastatic cell line, LNCaP.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI medium and they were subjected to stay in phenol-red free, RPMI with charcoal stripped serum for 48h. Synthetic androgen R1881 was added and the cells were allowed to grow for 48h. Control cells were given with corresponding amount of ethanol as vehicle which is used for the solubilization of R1881. Cells were harvested and RNA was isolated for microarray analysis.
