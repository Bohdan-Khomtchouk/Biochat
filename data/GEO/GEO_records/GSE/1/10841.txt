SUMMARY
RNA expression analysis was performed to compare patterns to sensitivity to BCL2 inhibitors (ABT-263). Overexpression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) is commonly associated with tumor maintenance, progression and chemoresistance.  We previously reported the discovery of ABT-737, a potent, small molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor.  A major limitation of ABT-737 is that it is not orally bioavailable.  This may limit its use for chronic single agent treatment and the flexibility to dose in combination with parenteral chemotherapy.  Here we report the discovery and biological properties of ABT-263, a potent, orally bioavailable Bad-like BH3 mimetic (Ki√¢??s of < 1 nM for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w).  The oral bioavailability of ABT-263 in preclinical animal models is 20% - 50%, depending on formulation.  ABT-263 disrupts Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interactions with pro-death proteins (e.g., Bim) in cells leading to the initiation of apoptosis within 2 hr post-treatment.  In human tumor cells, ABT-263 rapidly induces Bax translocation, cytochrome c release and subsequent programmed cell death.  Oral administration of ABT-263 alone induces complete tumor regressions in xenograft models of small cell lung cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  In xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma where ABT-263 exhibits modest or no single agent activity, it significantly enhances the efficacy of clinically relevant therapeutic regimens. These data provide the rationale for clinical trials evaluating ABT-263 in SCLC and B-cell malignancies. The oral efficacy of ABT-263 should provide dosing flexibility to maximize clinical utility as both a single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens.
