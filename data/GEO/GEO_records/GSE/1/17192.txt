TITLE
Evolution of sex-dependent gene expression in three recently diverged species of Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
To identify the transcriptome divergence and sex roles underlying it in recently diverged Drosophia pseudoobscura group, we compare the global gene expression of 7-day-old whole body adults of pure species.
