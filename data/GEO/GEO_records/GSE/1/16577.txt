SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptomic analysis: dietary treatment, genetic selection, and muscle fat content

DESIGN
We used fish from two divergent lines of rainbow trout, selected for low or high muscle fat content (respectively L and F lines) and fed two different diets, containing either 10% (LE diet) or 23% (HE diet) lipids. For more details about experimental fish and diets, see Kolditz et al., Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 294: R1154â€“R1164, 2008.  There are 4 experimental conditions: L-LE, L-HE, F-LE and F-HE. This experiment contain the data derived from the hybridization of the RNA extracted from individual muscle of these fish. For each membrane, spots with an oligonucleotide signal lower than three times the background level were excluded from the analysis. After this filtering step, signal processing was performed using the vector oligonucleotide data to correct each spot signal according to the actual amount of DNA present in each spot. After correction, the signal was normalized by dividing each gene expression value by the median value of the array. The study consisted of 19 samples total.
