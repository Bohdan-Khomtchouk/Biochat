TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the mature green stage.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected mature green seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing mature green-stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, cellularized peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, as well sets of serial sections encompassing the entire mature green stage seed.

DESIGN
Mature green stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).
