TITLE
miRNA expression data in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable fibrotic lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition. The expression and role of microRNAs (miRNA) has not been studied in IPF. Using miRNA expression microarrays we identified 46 differentially expressed miRNA in IPF lungs which included let-7d and the miR-30 family. Keywords: miRNA expression
