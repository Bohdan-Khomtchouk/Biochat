SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of A. parasiticus grown under conditions conducive and nonconductive for aflatoxin production was evaluated using glass slide microarrays containing 765 ESTs. Aflatoxins (AF) produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are responsible for approximately $270M in losses annually in the corn, peanut, cotton, and tree nut industries of the United States.  In an attempt to develop effective control procedures, research has focused on elucidating  the pathway of aflatoxin biosynthesis with the goal of identifying potential targets for intervention.  Research to date points to the involvement of complex and likely overlapping regulatory circuits.  To better understand the regulation by nutritional and environmental factors, a targeted cDNA microarray consisting of genes associated with AF production was employed to investigate the influence of nitrogen source, carbon source, temperature, and pH on AF production.  For each nutritional or environmental parameter examined, a condition conducive for aflatoxin production was compared with a condition that was non-conducive.  Three replicate cultures for each condition were grown.  Cultures were grown for 24 hours and harvested.  AF production for each culture was quantified and tissues were stored separately at -80C. For array hybridization, tissue samples for each condition were pooled and RNA extracted using Trizol reagent.
