TITLE
PDGF-induced genes regulated by the PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T98G glioblastoma cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and analyzed by DNA microarrays, which identified 74 immediate-early gene transcripts. Cells were then treated with inhibitors to identify subsets of genes that are targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Four groups of PDGF-induced genes were defined: independent of PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling, dependent on PI3K signaling, dependent on MEK/ERK signaling, and dependent on both pathways.  Cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%). For growth factor/inhibitor treatments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 72 h, and either left unstimulated, or stimulated for 30 min with human PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) (Sigma). U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology) and LY294002 (BioMol) were added 60 min prior to PDGF addition. Keywords: other
