TITLE
Gene expression profile of murine bone marrow endosteal populations (2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A subset of osteoblasts functions as a key component of the hematopoietic stem cell niche. But it is still unclear that the precise cellular and molecular contribution of endosteal cell populations on the HSC supportive microenvironment. We purified the endosteal cells and subdivided them into mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs: PDGF-Ra(+)Sca-1(+)) and two osteoblast populations (PDGF-Ra(-)Sca-1(-) and PDGF-Ra(+)Sca-1(-)). In this study, to clarify the characteristics of these fractionated cells in detail, gene expression analysis were performed using the GeneChip Mouse Genome Array 430 2.0 (Affymetrix).
