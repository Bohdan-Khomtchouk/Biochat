TITLE
miRNA expression profile of human subcutaneous adipose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: Potential regulators of adipogenesis include microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that have been recently shown related to adiposity and differentially expressed in fat depots. However, to date no study is available regarding the relationship of miRNAs expression profile, biological pathway and cellular phenotype during human adipogenesis. Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate whether miRNA expression profile in human adipocytes is related to adipogenesis and to test whether miRNA profile in human subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated to human obesity and co-morbidities. Keywords: miRNA expression
