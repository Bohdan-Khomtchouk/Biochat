TITLE
Endothelial Gene Expression in Regions of Defined Shear Exposure in the Porcine Iliac Arteries

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The effect of hemodynamic shear stress on endothelial gene expression was investigated in the porcine iliac arteries. Computational fluid dynamics simulations identified three anatomical regions likely to experience high, medium, and low shear stress. The expression of genes in endothelial cells recovered from these regions were assessed using microarray. Keywords: shear stress, endothelial cell gene expression, in vivo
