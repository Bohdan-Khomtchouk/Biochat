SUMMARY
ra08-01_cpl1 - transcriptome analysis of fry2 mutants - Compare the transcriptome of 2 mutants affected in FRY2 (fry2-1 and 14-5sep) to control plants. - The Arabidopsis 14-5sep mutant was isolated as overexpressing a NII::LUC construct fusing a tobacco nitrite reductase gene with the luciferase reporter gene. This mutant overexpressed also the endogenous Arabidopsis nitrite reductase gene. Map-based cloning showed that the 14-5 sep mutant was affected in the FRY2 gene. Transciptome analysis was performed on both the 14-5sep and the fry2-1 mutants and their respective controls (either the C24 ecotype containing the RD29A::LUC transgene for fry2-1 or the Col0 accession containing the NII::LUC transgene for the 14-5sep mutant) to analyze which genes are differentially expressed in the mutants versus control plants. Keywords: gene knock out
