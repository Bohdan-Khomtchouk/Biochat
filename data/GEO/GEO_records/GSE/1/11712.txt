TITLE
Gene expression level of six rice lineages

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Towards understanding gene expression variation among related rice lineages on a genome-wide scale, we sought to assess global gene expression in the heading-stage panicle using a whole genome oligonucleotide microarray designed to represent 36,926 annotated indica genes.
