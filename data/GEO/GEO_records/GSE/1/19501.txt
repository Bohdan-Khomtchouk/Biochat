TITLE
Maize gene expression during infection with Fusarium moniliforme

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The fungal pathogen Fusarium moniliforme causes ear rot in maize. Ear rot in maize is a destructive disease globally caused by Fusarium moniliforme , due to decrease of grain yield and increase of risks in raising livestock by mycotoxins production. Plants have developed various defense pathways to cope with pathogens. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during the infection process of Fusarium moniliforme in its host plant to get insights into the defense programs and the host processes potentially involved in plant defense against this pathogen.
