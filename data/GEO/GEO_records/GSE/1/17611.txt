TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of p63 binding sites identifies genes and regulatory elements for p63-related disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified p63 target genes and binding sites responsible for ectodermal defects by genome-wide profiling of p63 binding using ChIP-seq and expression analysis in human primary keratinocytes from patients with p63 mutations. As proof of principle, we identified a novel de novo microdeletion causing limb defects (SHFM1) that includes a p63 binding site functioning as a cis-regulatory element to control expression of the distally located DLX5/DLX6 genes essential for limb development. Our data demonstrate that target genes and regulatory elements detected in this study can serve as powerful tools to identify causative mutations of unresolved ectodermal disorders.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq profiles of p63 in primary human keratinocytes established from two different normal individuals.
