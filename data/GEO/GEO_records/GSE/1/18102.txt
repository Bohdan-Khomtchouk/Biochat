TITLE
Control vs. HMEC-1 cells treated with 100ng/ml TNF-alpha for 4h and 24h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HMEC-1 cells comparing untreated control cells with TNF-alpha-treated cells. Goal was to include more evidence by adding another research method. Keywords: Inflammatory stimulation

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. TNF-alpha-treated HMEC-1 cells. 1 control after 4h, 1 TNF-alpha-treated sample after 4h, 1 control after 24h, 1 TNF-alpha-treated sample after 24h. For each condition, 3 replicates of HMEC-1 cultures were grown and treated independently, then harvested and pooled for microarray.
