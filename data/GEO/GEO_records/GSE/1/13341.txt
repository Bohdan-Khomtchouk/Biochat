TITLE
Potato Gene Expression Associated with the RB-mediated Broad-Spectrum late blight resistance

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most damaging potato diseases. Genetic resistance is one of the most effective means to control the destruction caused by this pathogen. Transgenic potato lines harboring a resistance gene, RB, confer broad-spectrum, rate-reducing late blight resistance. A microarray approach was used to understand what genes are manipulated in the potato background after the addition of the RB gene that contribute to the late blight resistant phenotype. Keywords: Time course, disease state analysis
