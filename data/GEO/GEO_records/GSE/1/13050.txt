TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of the Zebrafish Mind Bomb Mutant

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To identify the genes differentially expressed in the zebrafish mibta52b mutant, genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE). 335 transcripts were identified whose expressions were significantly altered in the mibta52b mutant as compared with the wild-type.
