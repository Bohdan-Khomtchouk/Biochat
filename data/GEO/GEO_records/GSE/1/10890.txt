TITLE
mRNA Breast Cancer Cell Line Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA breast cancer cell lines were profiled to study the function of hsa-mir-221 and hsa-mir-222. MCF7 cell lines were profiled after treatment with mir-221/222 mimics, and compared to profiles with transfection controls. Similarly, MDA-MB-231 cell lines were profiled after treatment with mir-221/222 inhibitors, and compared to profiles with transfection controls. Since ESR1 is a predicted target of mir-221/222 we also profiled MCF7 cell lines after disrupting ESR1 with an siRNA. Other breast cancer cell lines are provided because all cell lines were normalized together. Keywords: breast cancer, cell line, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-222, ESR1
