TITLE
Expression data from Magnaporthe oryzae (M. grisea) in response to darkness

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
The dark-phase in light/dark cycle plays an important role in successful disease development in M. oryzae-Oryza sativa. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to light-to-dark transition. We identified different groups of genes (based on GO categories) that are up- or down-regulated in response to light-to-dark transition. Keywords: time course
