TITLE
Gene-level expression data in melanocytes and in melanoma cell lines WM1552C and A375 over-expressing miR211

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) influence cancer development through post-transcriptional negative regulation of both tumor suppressors and oncogenes.  We subjected melanoma cell lines, normal melanocytes, and keratinocytes to array based miRNA profiling, and identified several distinct miRNAs with differential expression.  Specifically, miR-211 levels were depleted in all eight melanoma cell lines examined, and also in 23 of 30 distinct patient melanoma samples (graded as primary in situ, regional metastatic, distant metastatic and nodal metastatic).  Putative target genes of miR-211 were identified, and their anticipated increased expression levels were confirmed in melanoma cell lines, which were reduced in two melanoma cell lines that artificially over-expressed miR-211.  Four such target genes (TCF12, RAB22A, KCNMA1 and SLC37A3) were confirmed by a target cleavage assay.  Stable over-expression of miR-211 in two melanoma cell lines caused significant growth inhibition and reduced invasiveness.  The differential expression of miR-211 in a variety of melanoma cell lines and clinical samples, consistent inverse correlation between miR-211 and its target mRNA levels, and growth retardation and reduced invasiveness of melanoma cell lines by miR-211 are all consistent with the idea that the depletion of miR-211 is a key step in melanoma development and/or progression

DESIGN
The 15 Samples in this submission represent gene-level expression profiling of isolated total RNA from WM1552C, WM1552+miRNA211, A375, A375+miRNA211 and melanocytes hybridized to Affymetrix exon ararys.
