TITLE
Integrated Network and Microarray Analysis to Identify New Biomarkers in Ischemic Heart Disease

SUMMARY
A significant proportion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients develop heart failure (HF). Early identification of patients at risk of developing HF after MI would be a major breakthrough. An approach combining the power of biological information networks and the precision of microarray analysis was undertaken to identify biomarkers of HF. A set of three new biomarkers of HF was identified and provided significantly improved prediction accuracy than microarray or network analysis alone. These three biomarkers, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B, thrombospondin-1 and placental growth factor are all related to angiogenesis, a natural process that favors the revascularization of the heart after MI and prevents the occurrence of HF. Therefore, combined network and microarray analysis allows a systematic and less biased approach to biomarker discovery.
