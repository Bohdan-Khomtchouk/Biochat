TITLE
Human NTERA2 (NT2/D1) cells lines: Genomewide distribution of ZRF1 at gene promoters during RA administration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chip-on-chip experiment with NT2 wildtype cells  untreated (0 h) or treated with Retinoic Acid (1h and 3 h) at 0.01 ÂµM. The goal was to determine the genome-wide occupancy of ZRF1 at gene promoters in undifferentiated cells and at the onset of differentiation.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment. Biological replicates: NT2 cells were treated with or without RA on three different days from cycling NT2 cells (0h, 1h and 3h of RA). Chromatin was prepared and a triplicate of IPs was performed with specific ZRF1 antibodies for every condition. A triplicate of control IPs was performed with IgGs.
