TITLE
Global transcriptional analysis of S. mutans metalloregulation

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Multiple S. mutans genes that are subject to SloR control are likely contributors to virulence.  The regulation of these genes in response to metal ion limitation vs. availability in the oral cavity can significantly facilitate the caries-forming process and hence continued analysis of these data can reveal novel candidate genes for the purposes of therapeutic intervention and/or prevention. Keywords: Genetic modification, dose response, metalloregulation
