TITLE
Expression data from E10.5 mouse otocyst

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established a novel EGFP reporter mouse line (named Tg(ETAR-EGFP)14Imeg), which enables the placode-derived inner ear sensory cell lineage to be visualized and monitored. At E10.5, EGFP expression was detected in the ventral and dorsomedial region of the otocyst. Using this reporter line and FACS-array technology, we performed gene expression profiling focused on the regional specificity of the otocyst.

DESIGN
We sorted E10.5 otocyst epithelial cells of heterozygous mice into EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We profiled the expression of the genes in FACS-enriched cell population and conducted transcriptome analysis.
