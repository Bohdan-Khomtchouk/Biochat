TITLE
Estrogen Regulates the JNK1 Genomic Localization Program in Breast Cancer Cells to Control Gene Expression and Cell Growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JNK1 ChIP-chip and ER-alpha ChIP-chip were performed on NimbleGen genomic tiling arrays to understand the genomic binding patterns of this MAP kinase and receptor and their relationship to gene expression.
