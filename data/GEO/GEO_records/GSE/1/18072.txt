TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dental follicle cells before and after osteogenic differentiation in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression profiles in dental follicle cells before and after osteogenic differentiation with dexamethasone.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental follicle cells before and after 28 days of differentiation in a standard osteogenic differentiation medium supplemented with dexamethasone
