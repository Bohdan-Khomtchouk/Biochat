TITLE
Genome-wide maps of GATA1 occupany in induced G1E ER4 cell line.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we mapped the locations of DNA segments occupied by GATA1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We have  produced  genome-wide GATA1 ChIP datasets after restoration and activation in G1E-ER4 cells. we employed the sequence census methodology of ChIP-seq , using Illumina GA2 technology to produce 23 million reads (36 nucleotides long) uniquely mapped to the mouse genome (mm8 assembly) for the GATA1 ChIP DNA and 15 million mapped reads for the input DNA

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factor GATA1 occupancy
