TITLE
MeDIP and ChIP-on-chip data from normal Prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the LNCaP cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genomic regions which display concordant epigenetics alterations in prostate cancer, we performed MeDIP and ChIP-on-chip profiling of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. These promoter arrays were integrated with expression arrays of the same cells to discover and characterise regions of Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
MeDIP and ChIP samples against active and repressive histone marks amplified and hybridised to Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R arrays, normalised to Input samples hybridised alongside
