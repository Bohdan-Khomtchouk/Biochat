TITLE
Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF1) and MuRF2 are Necessary but Functionally Redundant During Developmental Cardiac Growth and Regulate E2F1-Mediated Gene Expression In Vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle ring finger (MuRF) proteins have been implicated in the transmission of mechanical forces to nuclear cell signaling pathways through their association with the sarcomere.  We recently reported that MuRF1, but not MuRF2, regulated pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.  This was surprising since MuRF1 and MuRF2 interact redundantly with sarcomeric proteins in yeast two hybrid studies, and form both homo- and hetero-dimers with each other.  To determine if MuRF1 and MuRF2 were functionally redundant during development, we created mice lacking either 3 or 4 of the MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles and compared them functionally.  Surprisingly, only mice missing all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles (MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-) developed a spontaneous hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - mice that were null for one of the genes, but heterozygous for the other (i.e. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2+/- or MuRF1+/-//MuRF2-/-) were phenotypically identical to wild type mice.  Electron microscopy of the hearts of MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-(MuRF1/MuRF2 DN) mice identified altered Z disc and M line architecture, and a distinct swelling of mitochondria. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- mouse hearts displayed increased expression of genes associated with fetal cardiac metabolism, including smooth muscle actin and b myosin heavy chain, suggesting that the cardiac hypertrophy seen in these mice was associated with a reversion to a fetal gene program. Despite our prediction that we would also see an increase in glucose compared to fatty acid oxidation (another trait of fetal cardiac metabolism) we saw that MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- heart homogenates oxidized significantly less glucose compared to controls, suggesting an important role for MuRF1 and MuRF2 in the regulation of glucose metabolism in vivo. This study identifies a previously unreported redundancy in the function of MuRF proteins in normal cardiac development. Keywords: Genetic modification.
