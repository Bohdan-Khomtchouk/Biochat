TITLE
Molecular remodeling of ion channels, exchangers and pumps in atrial and ventricular myocytes in ischemic cardiomyopathy: left ventricle DCM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wanted to see whether the set of affected genes in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is the same or different as compared to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To find this out, we placed the single DCM sample on the same microarray slide with the ICM samples. Analysis of microarray data with ICM samples only showed 63 affected genes, while that carried out with 2 ICM samples PLUS one DCM sample reduced this number to just four genes. From this result we conclude that ICM and DCM affect different sets of genes in ventricular myocytes. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
