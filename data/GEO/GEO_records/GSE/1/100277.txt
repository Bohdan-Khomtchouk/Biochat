TITLE
Next-generation sequencing measuring mRNA expression in naïve T cells isolated from Mettl3 KO and WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve T cells were obtained by StemCell CD4+ T cell isolation kit of spleen from Mettl3 KO and WT mice followed by FACS sorting (CD4+CD25-CD45RB-Hi). Raw sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) with Tophat, and gene expression levels were measured by Cufflinks.

DESIGN
Mettl3 KO & WT mouse naïve T cells mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
