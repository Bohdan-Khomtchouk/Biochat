TITLE
ZicL ChIP-chip on Ciona intestinalis embryo (early gastrula)

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A genomic overview of in vivo binding of a transcription factor ZicL in the ascidian gastrula embryo. ZicL is a key regulator of the early ascidian development, and so called 'master-regulatory genes' for mesodermal and neural tissues are under the control of ZicL. Keywords: ChIP-chip
