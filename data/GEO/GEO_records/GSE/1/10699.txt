TITLE
The effects of artificial tethering of chromosomes to the nuclear periphery using LacI/lap2b anchorage constructs, part 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment:   analysis of gene expression changes between J21.c3 (non tethered)  vs J21.c3 lacI-lap2b (lap2b-lacI tethered) that both possess a Chr11 128mer LacO integrant Keywords: comparative hybridization to access expression profiles between tethered and non tethred cells.
