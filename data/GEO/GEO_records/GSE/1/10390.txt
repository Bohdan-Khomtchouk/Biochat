TITLE
Sex-dependent and HNF4alpha-dependent Mouse Liver Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of dual-channel gene expression profiles obtained using Rosetta/Agilent  Whole Mouse Genome oligonucleotide microarrays, 4 x 44K format, was used to identify sex-dependent and HNF4alpha-dependent differences in gene expression in adult mouse liver. This series is comprised of four sex-genotype combinations: adult male wild-type liver (M-WT), adult female wild-type liver (F-WT), adult male liver-specific HNF4alpha knockout liver (M-KO) and adult female liver-specific HNF4alpha knockout liver (F-KO). Four pools, each comprised of 4 randomly selected individual liver RNAs, were prepared for each sex-genotype combination. The pools were paired randomly to generate 4 separate experimental comparisons: M-WT:F-WT (first array comparison), M-WT:M-KO (second array comparison), F-WT:F-KO (third array comparison), and M-KO:F-KO (fourth array comparison). A total of 4994 HNF4alpha-dependent genes were identified, of which ~1000 fewer genes responded to the loss of HNF4alpha in female liver as compared to male liver. Moreover, 90% of the genes showing sex-specific expression in the liver were shown to lose sex specificity in HNF4alpha-deficient liver. Keywords: genetic knockout and sex response
