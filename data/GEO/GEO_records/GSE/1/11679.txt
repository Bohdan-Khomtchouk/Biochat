TITLE
Gene expression changes related to postnatal handling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Postnatal handling in rodents leads to decreased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood.  We used microarrays to look at gene expression differences in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in female mice subjected to postnatal handling compared to controls.
