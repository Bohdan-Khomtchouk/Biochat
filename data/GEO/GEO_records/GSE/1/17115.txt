TITLE
Gene Expression upon Doxorubicin Treatments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine C26 tumor xenografts displayed different responses to the treatments of PBS, Doxorubicin (Dox), and chimeric polypeptide (CP)-Dox conjugates. We used microarrays to globally study gene expression underlying these different responses and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes upon treatment.

DESIGN
C26 murine colon carcinoma xenografts were analyzed at 48 hours after treatment with CP-Dox, free Dox, and PBS (control). This study involved four replicates of each treatment.
