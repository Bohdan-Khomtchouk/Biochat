TITLE
Mechanism of sensitivity and resistance to treatment with an TfR1 antibody fusion protein in B-cell malignancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy due to its overexpression and central role in cancer pathology. Although antibodies targeting TfR1 have shown promise against malignancies, their efficacy is variable. The current work aims to elucidate the mechanism of sensitivity and resistance to treatment with an anti-TfR antibody fusion protein (ch128.1Av) using as models two malignant B-cell lines: the sensitive cell line IM-9 and the tolerant cell line U266. Keywords: Time course analysis

DESIGN
Duplicate samples of total mRNA from 2x10e5 IM-9 and cell line: U266 (tolerant) were collected prior treatment (time 0h) and after incubation with 10 nM ch128.1Av or buffer for 1h, 3h, 9h, and 24h
