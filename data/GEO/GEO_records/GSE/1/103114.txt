ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this assay was to determine the effect of ZIKV on host cellular pathways

DESIGN
Purified human CD14+ monocytes were infected with two strains of ZIKV (PR and NIG) and RNA was subjected for differential gene expression by next generation sequence analysis.
