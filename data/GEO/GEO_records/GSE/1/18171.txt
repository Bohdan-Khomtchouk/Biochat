TITLE
Expression data for EglN2 conditional knockdown in T47D breast carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was assayed from T47D SCR and T47D EGLN2 conditional knock down cell lines in order to profile the gene expression pattern regulated by EGLN2.

DESIGN
T47D cells that were infected with lentivirus encoding either conditonal EglN2 shRNA or Scr control shRNA were treated with Doxycycline for either 0 hr or 48hr followed by RNA extraction.
