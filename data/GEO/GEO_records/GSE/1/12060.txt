TITLE
Genome-associated RNA Polymerase II includes the dissociable Rpb4/7 subcomplex

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast RNA polymerase (Pol) II consists of a ten-subunit core enzyme and the Rpb4/7 subcomplex, which is dispensable for catalytic activity and dissociates in vitro. To investigate whether Rpb4/7 is an integral part of DNA-associated Pol II in vivo, we used chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled to high-resolution tiling microarray analysis. We show that the genome-wide occupancy profiles for Rpb7 and the core subunit Rpb3 are essentially identical. Thus, the complete Pol II associates with DNA in vivo, consistent with functional roles of Rpb4/7 throughout the transcription cycle. Keywords: ChIP-chip
