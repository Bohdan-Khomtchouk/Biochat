TITLE
mRNA profiling in rectus abdominis muscle from patients with upper GI cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rectus abdominis muscle biopsies were obtained from 65 upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer patients during open surgery and RNA profiling was performed on a subset of this cohort (n=21) using the Affymetrix U133+2 platform with the aim of identifying biomarkers of cancer related muscle wasting.

DESIGN
N = 21 (18 UGI cancer; 3 non cancer surgery)
