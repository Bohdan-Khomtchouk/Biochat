TITLE
An analysis of the impact of infection by Buchnera aphidicola APS on gene expression of Drosophila S2 cells.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
An analysis of the impact of infection by Buchnera aphidicola APS (isolated from Acyrthosiphon pisum strain LL01) on gene expression of S2 cells.  All comparisons are made against a pool of RNA from S2 cells not exposed to B. aphidicola.  B. aphidicola freshly isolated from the aphids, and data are collected at 1, 6 and 24 hours after exposure of S2 cells to the B. aphidicola preparation. Keywords: time course, Buchnera aphidicola APS, aphids, Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells
