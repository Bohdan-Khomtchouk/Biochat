TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae GINS complex progression (Psf2) determined ChIP-chip time course through the cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time points from two separate experiments – a) every 15 min after release from the G1 block from 0 min – 105 min and b) every 5 min beginning 20 min after block (through S-phase) from 20 -50 min. Data include composite of normalized high and low scan intensities

DESIGN
IP samples versus genomic DNA on 4x44k whole genome microarrays (Agilent) with average spatial resolution of ~290 nt
