TITLE
The Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Human Embryonic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides a framework describing how magnetic exposure is transduced from the most-plausible molecular-level ‘biosensor’ (lipid membranes) to cell-level responses that include differentiation toward neural lineages. In addition, SMF provided a stimulus that uncovered new relationships – that exist even in the absence of magnetic fields – between gangliosides, the time dependent regulation of IL-6 signaling by these glycolipids, and the fate of embryonic cells.
