TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in runx1-/- primitive erythroid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Targeted disruption of the Runx1/ AML1 gene in mice has demonstrated that it is required for the emergence of definitive hematopoietic cells, but that it is not essential for the formation of primitive erythrocytes. These findings led to the conclusion that Runx1 is a stage-specific transcription factor acting only during definitive hematopoiesis. However, the zebrafish and Xenopus homologues of Runx1 have been shown to play roles in primitive hematopoiesis, suggesting that mouse Runx1 might also be involved in the development of primitive lineages. In order to identify differentially expressed genes in runx1-/- primitive erythroid, we carried out microarray analysis. Keywords: genetic modification
