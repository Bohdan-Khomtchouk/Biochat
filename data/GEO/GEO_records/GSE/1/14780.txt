TITLE
Gene expression analysis of spargel mutant versus genetically matched wildtype control

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mammalian PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta and PRC are structurally related transcriptional coactivators, and are involved in multiple metabolic functions, including the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, due to redundancy, their in vivo roles are still poorly understood. By a genome-wide microarray study, we show that in the Drosophila larval fat body, Spargel (CG9809), the only fly PGC-1 family homologue, is required for proper expression of multiple genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed in total: three biological replicates of the control (wt) and three biological replicates of the mutant (KG).
