TITLE
Mouse primary megakaryocytes, wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify p45 target genes, we conducted gene expression profiling with p45-null megakaryocytes cultured from E14.5 fetal liver. Many genes encoding membrane proteins and enzymes related to platelet function, including Txas, Glycoprotein 6 (Gp6) and Selectin P (Selp), were repressed in the absence of p45. Considering the similar DNA binding specificity of p45 and Nrf2 in vitro, we expected p45 to activate cytoprotective genes that are established Nrf2 targets. However, the expression of numerous detoxifying enzymes and stress-responsive genes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (Nqo1), were increased in the absence of p45.
