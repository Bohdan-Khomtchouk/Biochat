TITLE
Temporal regulatory role of miR156 during leaf development

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The highly conserved plant microRNA, miR156, is an essential regulator for plant development. We found miR156 changed gradually during leaf development. To find how miR156 regulated genes temporally, we analyzed the transcriptome of old and young leaves from miR156-overexpressed and wild type plants. The results show that the gradual increase of miR156 regulates temporal changes of numerous gene expressions during leaf development.
