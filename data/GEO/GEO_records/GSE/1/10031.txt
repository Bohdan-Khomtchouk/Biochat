TITLE
mRNA expression data in Δrsf1mutant during growth on, and transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Rsf1p is a putative transcription factor required for efficient growth using glycerol as sole carbon source but not for growth on the alternative respiratory carbon source ethanol. We use microarrays to determine the differences in the transcriptional program between the Δrsf1 mutant and the wild type during respiratory growth on glycerol as well as the transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source. Keywords: Mutant analysis during timecourse following switching carbon source from dextrose to glycerol
