TITLE
Multiple RNA structures affect translation initiation and UGA redefinition efficiency during synthesis of selenoprotein p

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice carrying genomic deletions of SECIS1 or SECIS2 in the Selenop gene were euthanized and liver tissue was harvested and processed for RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling. From these studies, we determined the affect of SECIS1 and SECIS2 on UGA redifinition across the Selenop gene.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from mice carrying genomic deletions of the 3' UTR SECIS1 or SECIS2 elements of Selenop
