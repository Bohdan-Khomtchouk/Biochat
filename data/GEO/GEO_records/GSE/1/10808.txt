TITLE
Chronic potassium chloride (KCl) treatment induced gene expression changes in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have recently developed a Drosophila behavioral- and transcriptomic- based (systems) model of chronic pentylenetetrazole induced locomotor plasticity. Pharmacological validation at behavioral level and at the level of fly head microarray gene expression shows that the model is of potential value in screening of compounds for detecting antiepileptic, antiepileptogenic, disease-modifying and neuroprotective activities. While screening compounds using this model at behavioral level, potassium chloride (KCl) was identified as having therapeutic potential. Examination of transcriptomic changes induced by KCl in fly head further supports its potential use as a therapeutic agent in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Keywords: Drug Response
