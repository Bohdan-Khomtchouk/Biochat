TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Leishmania infantum antimony resistant strains using full-genome DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Leishmania infantum

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to detect any gene expression modulation in an antimony resistant L.infantum Sb2000.1 strain compared to an antimony sensitive L.infantum WT strain. We want to identify the modulated genes associated with an antimony resistant phenotype. The Sb2000.1 resistant strain used is about 1000 times more resistant to SbIII than the WT sensitive strain. The full-genome DNA microarrays includes one 70-oligonucleotide probe for each gene of L. infantum. Keywords: drug resistance

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, resistant strain Sb2000.1 vs wild-type. Five biological replicates for each strain, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array
