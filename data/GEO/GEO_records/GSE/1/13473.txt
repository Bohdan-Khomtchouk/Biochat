TITLE
Response of C. elegans immune pathway mutants to P. aeruginosa infection

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Synchronized C. elegans cultures of three geontypes -- wildype N2, daf-2(e1370) and sma-6(wk7) -- were prepared using standard techniques ( ). Live young adult worms were split between NG plates pre-seeded with the non-pathogenic E. coli strain OP50 or the Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate PA14 and incubated at 25C for 4 or 24 hours before harvesting. This experiment was repeated at least three times on independent occasions. cDNA probes were prepared from experimental samples and from reference mRNA extracted from mixed stage wild type worms grown at 25C, and were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, as indicated. A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Elapsed Time: Time Infection: Exposure to the non-pathogenic E. coli strain OP50 or to the  pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 Strain Name: C. elegans wildtype strain N2 or the immune pathway mutants daf-2(e1370) or sma-6(wk7) Keywords: reference_design
