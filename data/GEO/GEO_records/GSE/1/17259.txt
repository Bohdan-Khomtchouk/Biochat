TITLE
S. pombe acetyltransferase mutants identifies redundant pathways of gene regulation, dual-channel dataset

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Analysis of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) from the MYST and GNAT families in S. pombe to identify functional differences or overlap with regard to gene expression. Mutations were made to Elp3 and Gcn5 (GNAT family), and to Mst2 (MYST family). Mutants showed distinct phenotypes which were repressed or enhanced by mutant combinations.

DESIGN
Mutations were made to Gcn5 (GNAT family), and to Mst2 (MYST family) in S. pombe. A treatment of 1M KCl was applied for 60min to some samples. RNA was extracted from the various mutants and hybridized on Eurogentec arrays.
