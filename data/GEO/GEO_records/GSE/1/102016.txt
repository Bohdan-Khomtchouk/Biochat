TITLE
Expression profile from mouse lung treated with B[a]P and LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Patients with inflammatory lung diseases are often additionally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like B[a]P and B[a]P-induced alterations in gene expression in these patients may contribute to the development of lung cancer. Mice were intra-nasally treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 Î¼g/mouse) to induce pulmonary inflammation and subsequently exposed to B[a]P (0.5 mg/mouse) by intratracheal instillation We used RNA microarrays to detail the global gene expression change after each treatment. Meanwhile, compared the up- and down-regulated gene between the LPS & BaP and BaP in order to identify the role of inflammation on BaP induced carcinogenesis

DESIGN
15 mouse lung were analyzed, including 3 control, 4 LPS, 4 BaP and 4 LPS & BaP. All lung samples were collected after 72 hours and RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix RNA microarrays.
