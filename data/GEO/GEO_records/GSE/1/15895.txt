TITLE
Expression data from C2C12 myoblasts transduced with PRDM16 or vector

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM16 is a 140 kDa transcriptional coregulatory protein. PRDM16 has been shown to function as a bi-directional switch in brown fat cell fate by stimulating the development of brown fat cells from myf-5 positive myoblastic precursors. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the myoblasts-brown fat conversion induced by PRDM16.

DESIGN
undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were stably expressed with retroviral PRDM16 or vector control.  Total RNAs were isolated by Trizol, and subjected to Affymetrix microarrays.
