TITLE
GENE EXPRESSION OF AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PENTAPEPTIDE ON CIA MURINE DEVELOPMENT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Monocyte Locomotion Inhibitory Factor (MLIF), an amoebic peptide, has an anti-inflammatory role,  delaying the arrival of mononuclear cells to inflammatory sites, down regulating adhesin molecules and chemokines. We used microarrays to detail the global  gene expression underlying anti-inflammatory effect of MILF in an inflammatory model. Collagen type II (CII) emulsified on complet Freund adjuvant, was injected on the tail of the base of DBA1J mice, 8 weeks older, and booster with CII emulsified in incomple Freund adjuvant three weeks later. MLIF was administrated intranasally weekly since one week before induction. Keywords: comparison effect

DESIGN
Articular tissues of all mices were collected at the peak time of clinical severity (four weeks before booster),  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We induces CIA with chicken collagen type II, emulsified with Complet Adjuvant of Freund, and the controls were mice induced only with Complet Adjuvant of Freund with or without MLIF
