TITLE
Timecourse of developing mouse placenta, with placental and decidual tissues profiled separately

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used full genome microarrays to profile the full lifetime of the mouse placenta from embryonic day 8.5 (e8.5), at the time of chorioallantoic fusion, until postnatal day 0 (P0). At each stage, the fetal placenta and maternal decidual tissues were dissected and profiled separately Keywords: time course
