TITLE
mRNA regulation in normal or TNF-a/IL-4-activated bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina microarray experiment on BEAS-2B cells. Cells  were seeded 24 h before TNF-a/IL-4 (50 ng/ml) treatment that lasted for 18 h. Cytoplasmic RNA of both normal and activated BEAS-2B cells were collected for microarray. Cells  were seeded 24 h before TNF-a/IL-4 (50 ng/ml) treatment that lasted for 18 h.
