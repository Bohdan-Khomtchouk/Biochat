TITLE
Expression data of two human cancer cell lines cultivated in 2-dimensional (2D) vs. 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
3D cultivation of cells lead to changes in morphology of the cells. This is likely to explain the higher radioresistance of cells growing in 3D compared to cells growing in 2D cell culture. Whole genome gene expression is performed to determine genes involved in changes of cell moroholgy and radioresistance. Keywords: comparison of 2D vs. 3D cell culture

DESIGN
RNA of cells was isolated four days after growing in the two different cell culture systems
