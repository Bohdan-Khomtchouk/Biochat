ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The GEMINAL Study- Gene Expression Modulation by Intervention with Nutrition and Lifestyle We conducted a pilot study to examine changes in gene expression in men diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer who participated in an intensive nutrition and lifestyle intervention. We profiled gene expression in morphologically normal tissues from prostate biopsies of all 30 participants before and after the intervention. Keywords: Differential gene expression analysis
