TITLE
Transcriptomic regulation during meiosis (Spo11Y135F mutant)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We studied the meiotic regulation of transcription in the mutant Spo11Y135F (deficient for the formation of meiotic double-strand breaks), by comparing the mRNA level at time t=1h to t=8h after meiosis induction, to the mRNA level at time t=0h. Keywords: yeast meiotic time course, transcriptome
