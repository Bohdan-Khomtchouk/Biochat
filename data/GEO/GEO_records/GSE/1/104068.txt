TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of changes in gene expression induced by Eph and ephrin stimulation of mouse neural progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothesis tested in the present study was that activation of Eph or ephrin signaling in neural progenitors induces a transcriptional response which participate in the control of progenitor self-renewal. Results provide important information on transcriptional changes in response to activation of Eph receptors. They also show that activation of ephrin signaling does not induce a transcriptional response at genome-wide level.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from dissociated mouse embryonic neural progenitors incubated for 2 or 6 hours with recombinant Eph or ephrin molecules compared to control treated neural progenitors.
