TITLE
Kainic acid-administered Rat brain: control vs Ketogenic diet-fed

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The ketogenic diet has long been used to treat epilepsy, but its mechanism is not yet clearly understood. To explore the potential mechanism, the changes in gene expression induced by the ketogenic diet in the rat kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model were analyzed.
