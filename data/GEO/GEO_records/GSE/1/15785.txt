TITLE
Profiling of the response of genes in the rat liver to hepatotoxicants

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This data set comprises of the standardized experimental design for the microarray gene expression data derived from the rat liver (target tissue) after treatment with eight known hepatotoxicants (at multiple time points and doses with multiple biological replicates and a fluor-flip for each biological sample).

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression data from the livers of F344/N male rats 10-12 weeks of age exposed for 6, 24 or 48 hrs to a low, medium or high dose of one of eight hepatotoxicants.
