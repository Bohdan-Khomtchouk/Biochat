TITLE
Genome-wide small RNAs analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare small RNA profiles (sRNA-seq) of HSV-1 infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 strain at 48 hours post infection.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of  HSV-1 infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 cells at 48 hours post infection were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
