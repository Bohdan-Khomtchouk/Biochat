SUMMARY
Understanding the mechanisms that specify neuronal subtypes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms of neuronal circuit assembly. Here we have identified a novel role for the transcription factor AP2γ in progenitor and neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex. Conditional deletion of AP2γ causes misspecification of basal progenitors starting at mid-neurogenesis and gain-of-function experiments show that AP2γ directly regulates the expression of several genes characteristic for basal progenitors, such as Math3 and Tbr2. The misspecification of basal progenitors upon loss of AP2γ resulted in their increased death and the ultimate reduction of callosal layer II/III projection neurons. This had pronounced effects on visual performance with a strong reduction of visual acuity. Thus, we have identified a novel regulator of basal progenitor fate regulating the number of layer II/III neurons in an area-specific manner and revealing their importance for accurate function of the visual cortex.
