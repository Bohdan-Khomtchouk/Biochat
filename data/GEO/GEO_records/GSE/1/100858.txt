TITLE
IL-22 inhibits allergic airway inflammation in house dust mite-induced asthma models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the pathogenesis of asthma is mainly orchestrated by antigen-specific Th2 cells and their cytokines, recent findings indicate the involvement of other subsets of helper T cells including Th17 cells. Previous studies have shown that IL-22, one of Th17 cell-related cytokines, plays multiple roles in regulating allergic airway inflammation; however, the mechanism underlying the Il-22-mediated regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that allergic airway inflammation upon intratracheal administration of house dust mite extract (HDM), a representative allergen, were exacerbated in IL-22-deficient mice.  To address the molecular mechanisms by which IL-22 inhibits the development of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation, we next performed an unbiased comprehensive screening of genes induced by IL-22 administration in the lung by RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Lung total RNA profiles of wild type (WT) and IL-22 knock out mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq.
