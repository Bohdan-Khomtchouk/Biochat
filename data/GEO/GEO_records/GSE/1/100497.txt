TITLE
High-resolution mapping of heteroduplex DNA formed in UV-induced and spontaneous mitotic recombination events in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In yeast, DNA breaks are usually repaired by homologous recombination (HR). An early step for HR pathways is formation of a heteroduplex, in which a single-strand from the broken DNA molecule pairs with a strand derived from an intact DNA molecule.  If the two strands of DNA are not identical, there will be mismatches within the heteroduplex DNA (hetDNA). In wild-type strains, these mismatches are repaired by the mismatch repair (MMR) system, producing a gene conversion event. In strains lacking MMR, the mismatches persist. Most previous studies involving hetDNA formed during mitotic recombination were restricted to one locus. Below, we present a global mapping of hetDNA formed in the MMR-defective mlh1 strain. We find that many recombination events are associated with repair of double-stranded DNA gaps and/or involve Mlh1-independent mismatch repair. Many of our events are not explicable by the simplest form of the double-strand break repair model of recombination.

DESIGN
Using whole genome and chromosome-specific SNP microarray, we mapped heteroduplex DNA, a recombination intermediate, from all four granddaughter cells after spontaneous or UV-induced mitotic recombination events. We also determined linkage of SNPs by mapping spores derived from these granddaughter cells.
