TITLE
Performance Evaluation of Commercial miRNA Expression Array Platforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data is part of a miRNA platform comparison study. We compared the performance characteristics of four commercial miRNA array technologies and found that all platforms performed well in separate measures of performance.  The Ambion and Agilent platforms were more accurate, whereas the Illumina and Exiqon platforms were more specific.   Furthermore, the data analysis approach had a large impact on the performance, predominantly by improving precision.
