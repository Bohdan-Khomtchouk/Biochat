TITLE
Root-specific transcriptional profiling of contrasting rice genotypes in response to salinity stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of root gene expression of salt-tolerant genotypes FL478, Pokkali and IR63731, and salt-sensitive genotype IR29 under control and salinity-stressed conditions during vegetative growth. Results provide insight into the genetic basis of salt tolerance in indica rice. Keywords: stress response
