TITLE
Gene expression analysis of rat livers treated with pharmaceutical development compounds

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze gene expression changes in liver after treatment of rats with two compounds from drug development (R1, R2) to identify potential effects related to hepatotoxicity. The development cpds have been described in: Pierson et al., J Med Chem 52: 3855-62. R1 corresponds to 36, R2 corresponds to 38

DESIGN
Compound R1 or R2, or vehicle control, was given for either 24h or 2 weeks (336h) at different doses.
