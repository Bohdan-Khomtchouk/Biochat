TITLE
BTG1 regulates glucocorticoid receptor autoinduction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAi mediated knockdown of BTG1 in the acute lymphoblastic cell line RS4;11 causes this cell line to become resistant to prednisolone treatment when compared to control cells. In this experiment we treated BTG1 knockdown RS4;11 cells and control RS4;11 cells either with prednisolone or a vehicle control and compared the gene expression patterns of these cell lines.

DESIGN
8 samples were analyzed: we treated RS4;11 control or RS4;11 shRNA BTG1 cells with either prednisolone or vehicle control, the experiment was performed in duplicate. Genes with a > 2-fold change in expression after prednisolone treatment when compared to vehicle treatment were selected. Expression changes in BTG1 knockdown cells were compared to those in control vector transduced cells.
