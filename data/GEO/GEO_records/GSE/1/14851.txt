TITLE
Gene expression in the embryonic serosa of Anopheles gambiae

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Whole-genome transcriptome assays were performed with isolated serosa from A. gambiae embryos. These assays identified a large number of genes implicated in the production of the larval cuticle. In D. melanogaster, these genes are activated just once during embryogenesis, during late stages where they are used for the production of the larval cuticle. Evidence is presented that the serosal cells secrete a dedicated serosal cuticle, which protects A. gambiae embryos from desiccation.
