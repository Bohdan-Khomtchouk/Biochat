Genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs in human CD4+ T cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) function antagonistically to control histone acetylation. As acetylation is a histone mark for active transcription, HATs have been associated with active and HDACs with inactive genes. We describe here genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs binding on chromatin and Ô¨Ånd that both are found at active genes with acetylated histones. Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs.

DESIGN
high throughput sequencing: genome-wide analysis of 5 HATs, 4 HDACs in human CD4+ cells, Tip60 and HDAC6 in activated CD4 cells, genome-wide analysis of 2 histone acetylations and RNA Polymerase II after HDAC inhibitor treatment in CD4, histone modification with WDR5 knock-down and HDAC inhibitor treatment in HeLa cells expression profiling: Global change in gene expression in human CD4+ T cells after HDAC inhibitor treatment for 2hours and 12 hours.
