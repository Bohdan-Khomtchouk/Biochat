TITLE
MicroRNA Expression in Rat Myocardial Infarction intervened by propranolol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established a rat model of myocardial Infarction by performing a surgical operation of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion under sterie conditions. Wistar rats were previously randomly divided into 4 groups: control, ischemia, ischemia-propranolol, and non-ischemia-propranolol. Our data suggested that propranolol could reverse many microRNAs with too high or too low expression in the ischemia group versus control group.
