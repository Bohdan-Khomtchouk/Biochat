TITLE
p73 activity and rapamycin treatment: ChIP-on-Chip and gene expression profiling studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p73 is a p53 family transcription factor that plays critical roles during development and tumor suppression. We analyzed p73 activity using a combination of ChIP-on-Chip and gene expression profiling, both at baseline and after treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
