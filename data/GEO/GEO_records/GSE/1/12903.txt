TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis for response of EHEC  to short chain fatty acids

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an emerging pathogen that causes diarrhea and heamolytic uremic syndrome. Expression of genes associated to pathogenicity is strictly regulated by environmental factors. Since short chian fatty acids (SCFAs) are present in intestinal tract which is a target of EHEC infection, we investigated the response of EHEC genes to SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate. Keywords: Culture condition
