TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of primary human dermal fibroblasts_comparing young (5 month old) and old (78 years old) samples treated with GC4419

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the age-associated changes in the nuclear encoded genes of the mitochondrial ETC following treatment with a Superoxide dismutase mimetic GC4419 using the mitochondrial energy metabolism profiler array from Qiagen.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiler array.  Both samples were treated with 0.25 uM of GC4419. 48 hours following the treatment with GC4419, equal amount total RNA from each donor was isolated prior to making the cDNA and analyzing the changes in nuclear-encoded genes.
