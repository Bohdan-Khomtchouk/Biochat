TITLE
Zebrafish embryos: Control vs. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treated

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 24 hours post-fertilization zebrafish embryos comparing control untreated embryos with embryos raised in 75uM 5-azadC. 5-azadC blocks methylation. The goal was to determine genes regulated by methylation during development.
