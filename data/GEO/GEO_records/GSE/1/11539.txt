TITLE
Murine embryonic lung development: time course (C57BL/6J)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated gene expression profiles of 5 time points in murine lung development (E11.5, E13.5, E14.5, E16.5 and P5). The goal of this study was to establish a reference data set for exploration of large-scale similarities between transcriptomes in development and cancer. Keywords: time course
