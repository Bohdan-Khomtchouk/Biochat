TITLE
Transcriptomic Comparison in the Retinas of Two Mouse Models of Diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse models of type I diabetes offer the potential to combine genetic approaches with other pharmacological or physiological manipulations to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.  Type I diabetes is induced in mice through chemical toxins or may arise spontaneously from genetic mutations.  Both models are associated with retinal vascular and neuronal changes.  Retinal transcriptomic responses in C57BL/6J mice treated with strepotozotocin and Ins2Akita were compared after 3 months of hyperglycemia.  Specific gene expression changes suggest a neurovascular inflammatory response in diabetic retinopathy.  Genes common to the two models may represent the response of the retina to hyperglycemia; while changes unique to each model may represent time-dependent disease progression differences in the various models.  Further investigation of the commonalities and differences between mouse models of type I diabetes may define cause and effect events in early diabetic retinopathy disease progression.

DESIGN
To compare two mouse models of type I diabetes, ie, STZ-induced and Ins2Akita, a gene expression analysis was conducted examining whole retinas collected after 3 months of hyperglycemia.
