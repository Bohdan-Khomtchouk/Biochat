TITLE
Gene expression effects of morpholino directed spRunt-1 knockdown on hatched blastula stage embryos

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Runt domain (Runx) transcription factors constitute a metazoan family of sequence specific DNA binding proteins that are essential for animal development.  The sea urchin Runx gene SpRunt-1, which is expressed globally during early embryogenesis, is required for blastula stage cell proliferation and subsequently for cell survival.   To obtain a comprehensive list of SpRunt-1 regulatory targets we screened a  custom microarray representing the blastula stage transcriptome of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, comparing relative hybridization signals  generated by labeled RNA from 18 hr control versus SpRunt-1 morphant  embryos.

DESIGN
For an 8x15k chip the 8 arrays were 4 biological replicates and a dye swap of the same 4. Biological Replicates - Four separate embryo cultures, each from a different mating pair were initiated and divided into a control group and a treatment group.  All of the embryos in the treatment group were micoinjected with a splice-blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MASO) targeted to SpRunt-1. All control and sample embryos were developed to hatched blastula stage (18 hours post-fertilization) in filtered seawater at 15Â°C. Total RNA was extracted from each of the four separate samples (3,600 embryos in each sample) with an RNA yield near 5 micro grams per sample.  Total RNA was also extracted from the untreated embryos of each separate culture pooled together (about 14,400) with an RNA yield near 20 micro grams. Technical (dye swap) Replicates - Control derived Cy3 (green) labeled aRNA was mixed with sample derived Cy5 (red) labeled aRNA in one biological replicate set of 4 samples and using half of the extracted RNA amount.  The other half of the RNA was reciprocally labeled with control derived aRNA Cy5 labeled and sample derived aRNA Cy3 labeled.
