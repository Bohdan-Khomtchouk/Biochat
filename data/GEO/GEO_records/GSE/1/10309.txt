Claudin-1 is an Invasion and Metastasis Suppressor of Lung Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Claudin-1(CLDN1), one of the key components of tight junction proteins, was found to be down-regulated in human lung adenocarcinomas. This study we investigated the clinical significance of CLDN1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients and its role in cancer progression. Method: CLDN1 mRNA expression was measured in tumor specimens from 51 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. CLDN1 protein expression was also examined by immunohistochemistry on specimens from an independent cohort of 67 lung adenocarcinoma patients. CLDN1 and cancer cell migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis were studied by compared CLDN1 overexpressed, specific shRNA knockdown cells and controls. The Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed to identify CLDN1 downstream genes. Results: Lung adenocarcinoma patients with low expression of CLDN1 mRNA had shorter overall survival (p = 0.032, log-rank test). This result was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry of CLDN1 protein expression in an independent cohort of lung adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.024). Over-expression of CLDN1 inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis. Knockdown of the exogenous CLDN1 expression in CLDN1 transfectants can restore the cancer cell invasive and metastatic ability. By using Affymetrix microarray we have identified panel of genes altered by CLDN1 over-expression. CLDN1 can up-regulate several cancer invasion/metastasis suppressors such as CTGF, THBS1, DLC1, OCLN, ZO-1, and also down-regulate invasion/metastasis enhancers such as SPP1, CUTL1, TGF-Î±, SLC2A3, PGF, which support that CLDN1 may behave as an invasion and metastasis suppressor. Conclusions: CLDN is a cancer invasion and metastasis suppressor. CLDN1 expression is a useful prognostic predictor and a potential drug treatment target for lung adenocarcinoma patients.
