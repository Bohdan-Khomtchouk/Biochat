TITLE
cDNA expression profiles of +7 DPA wild-type upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum cv. Xuzhou142) ovules over the one-year cycle

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
A cDNA library from 0-10 day post anthesis cotton ovules was established to study genes expressed in cotton ovule during initiation and quickly elongation period. We randomly sequenced over 100,000 ESTs from this library and acquired a gene pool of more than 28,000 UniESTs. The cotton UniESTs were then PCR-amplified and printed onto microarray. This array is comprised of about 28000 high-quality cotton cDNAs (with average length > 750bp) and external controls. To study the different growth potential of cotton fibers in a one-year cycle, we then hybridized the array with RNA samples derived from +7 DPA wild-type upland cotton fibers in four different seasons, respectively.
