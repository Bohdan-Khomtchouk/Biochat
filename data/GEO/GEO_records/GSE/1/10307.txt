TITLE
Transcription analysis of E. coli processed at persistent and decreasing glucose limitation in a fed-batch cultivation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. W3110

SUMMARY
A time series of whole-genome transcription profiling of E. coli K-12 W3110 was performed to study the dynamic physiological response of E. coli K-12 W3110 to limited carbon conditions. cDNA from eight time intervals after glucose limitation, representing different stages of glucose depletion, along with cDNA of an unrestricted growth were hybridized to whole-genome microarrays of E. coli K-12. Glucose concentrations were gradually reduced in a fed-batch cultivation process with constant feeding rate in a bioreactor. Major focus was put on the dynamic changes in the transcription level of genes involved in the central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt), high-affinity glucose transport systems, movement, growth, and stress response. In total, 40 microarrays were hybridized. The data were statistically analysed using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). The data were normalized “print-tip-loess”. “Multiple hypothesis testing” correction was performed with the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), which controls the “false discovery rate” (fdr). Genes were regarded as differentially expressed when the “adjusted p values” were < 0.05, therefore nominally controlling the expected fdr to less than 0.05. The reproducibility of dye swap experiments as well as biological replicates was estimated by calculating “Pearson’s correlation coefficients”. A high correlation was observed for the dye swap pairs (with averaged Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.89 ± 0.06 for the reference samples and of 0.87 ± 0.08 for the different points of time) as well as for biological replicates (with averaged Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.86 ± 0.04 for the red channel (Cy5) and 0.80 ± 0.09 for the green channel (Cy3)).

Supplementary files: Data_table_A: TabelleA_Signifikante.txt Description: Data table with coefficients of the linear model for every gene which was differentially expressed for at least one point in time according to the reference sample. The statistical analysis was performed as described in Series section (GSE10307) based on the normalized log2(test/ref) ratios in the Sample records' VALUE columns.

Every differentially expressed gene of the corresponding point in time according to the reference sample is listed. Genes were regarded as differentially expressed when their 'adjusted P.values' were < 0.05, therefore nominally controlling the expected fdr to less than 0.05. The data are based on maximal three biological replicates (three independent fed-batch cultivations). RT-PCR_results_7genes.txt and RT-PCR_protocol.PDF Keywords: Time course, stress response
