SUMMARY
Samples for microarray analysis were derived from terminal ileum and colonic tissues from probands with Crohn´s disease and Ulcerative Colitis and control patients, respectively. IBD tissue biopsies from non-inflamed regions 10 cm distant from pathological areas were selected. To minimize inter-individual differences in gene expression and to enrich for IBD-specific transcriptional events, 2.5 µg of total RNA from terminal ileum and colon transversum from four individuals of each patient and control group were used for pooling.
