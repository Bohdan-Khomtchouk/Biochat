TITLE
Developmental timecourse of C. elegans small RNAs with 5p monophosphates

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These datasets profile the expression of small RNAs with 5p monophosphates and 3p hydroxyls (including miRNAs, 21U-RNAs) across C. elegans development and in dauer, glp-4 mutant, and mixed-stage wt worms. These datasets were prepared in the David P. Bartel laboratory using T4 RNA ligase Rnl2(1-249). Keywords: miRNA and 21U-RNA discovery and developmental expression profiling
