TITLE
Transcriptome of Arabidopsis APS kinase null mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to look at transcriptional changes in null mutants of APS kinase. There are four APS kinase isoforms in Arabidopsis, we are interested in the double mutant APK1/APK2, created by crossing two single salk lines. The transcriptomes of WT (Col-0) plants and the double knockout (ab) will be compared. The plants were grown under controlled environment conditions of 10h day, 14h night, 22 degrees centigrade, 60% humidity for five weeks. 10 whole rosettes were pooled for each replicate, there are three replicates for each genotype. Keywords: Expression profilling by array

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment
