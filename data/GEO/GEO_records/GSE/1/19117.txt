TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and NKCC1 (SLC12A2)-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and NKCC1-knockout small intestine.

DESIGN
6 wild-type and 6 NKCC1-knockout small intestine RNA samples were compared.  Total RNA was collected from both male and female 8-week old wild-type and NKCC1-null mice on an inbred FVB\N background. All comparisons were done between wild-type and NHE4-null samples from age- and gender-matched mice.
