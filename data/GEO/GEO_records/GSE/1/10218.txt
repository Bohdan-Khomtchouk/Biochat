TITLE
Keratinocyte specific Fos-deletion in K5-Sos-F mouse tumor model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression and function of the oncogenic transcription factor AP-1 (mainly composed of Jun and Fos proteins) is required for neoplastic transformation of mouse and human keratinocytes in vitro and tumor promotion as well as malignant progression in vivo. Here, we describe the identification of novel Fos target genes using global gene expression profiling with samples from a tumor model of mouse skin (K5-SOS-F). We could identify 366 differentially expressed genes comparing expression profiles from tumor samples of control animals with samples derived form mice with a specific deletion of fos in keratinocytes. Keywords: Fos-deletion, Fos-floxed, K5-SOS-F mouse tumor model, skin papilloma, global gene expression, microarray, Fos target in skin carcinogenesis
