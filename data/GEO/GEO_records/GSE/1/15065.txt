TITLE
C/EBPbeta-2 regulation of gene expression in MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C/EBPbeta-2 results in EMT and ErbB indpendence this project investigated the gene changes in related genes upon C/EBPbeta-2 overexpression in MCF10A cells. We used microarray analysis  to detail the global gene expression mediated by C/EBPbeta-2 and identified changes in known EMT genes, however, known ErbB related genes were not altered.

DESIGN
MCF10A with or without C/EBPbeta-2 were compared.
