TITLE
PRC2 in Ewing tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found the PRC2 component EZH2 to be upregulated by the pathognomonic fusion oncogene EWS-FLI1 in Ewing tumors and mesenchymal stem cells (Richter GH et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009;106:5324-9). Downregulation of EZH2 by RNA interference in Ewing tumor cell lines suppressed oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that EZH2 might play a central role in Ewing Tumor pathology.

DESIGN
RNA from tumor samples was isolated with Trizol and subjected to microarray analysis using HG_U133A microarrays following the Affymetrix protocol. Ewing tumors vs. neuroblastoma controls
