TITLE
Novel chimeric transcript RRM2-c2orf48 promotes metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis was performed on the vector and over-expressing RRM2-c2orf48 NPC cell samples(CNE2-PMSCV-Vector and CNE2-PMSCV-RRM2-c2orf48). Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells using TRIzol reagent and was further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufactures’ instructions. RNA quality was assessed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Total RNA was labeled and hybridized to the CapitalBio Corporation’s Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). We applied a two class unpaired method available through the Significant Analysis of Microarray software (SAM) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between vector and over-expression samples. Genes were deemed significantly differentially expressed based on a selection threshold of a false discovery rate of FDR < 5% and a fold change level of ＞1.5 in the SAM output results.

DESIGN
Micrarray analysis was preformed on the vector and RC of CNE2 cell line
