TITLE
Difference in skeletal muscle function in Males vs Females; Role of Estrogen Receptor Beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male skeletal muscles are generally faster and have a higher maximum power output than female muscles. Conversely, during repeated contractions female muscles sre generally more fatigue resistant and recover faster. we hypothesized that estrogen receptor beta is involved in this gender difference. The Affymetrix micorarray were used to deteced the differently expressed genes between male BERKO and WT mice in soleus muscles. Soleus muscles from 3 individual mouse of each genotype were used to perform the experiment. Keywords: repeat sample
