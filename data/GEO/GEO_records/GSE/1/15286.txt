TITLE
Epigenetic modifications and their relationships to smRNA and mRNA transcriptomes in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Genome-wide and organ-specific landscapes of epigenetic modifications and their relationships to mRNA and smRNA transcriptomes in maize We report an integrated genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, histone modifications, smRNAs and mRNA transcriptional activity, using maize as a model. We surveyed the epigenomes of the maize inbred line B73 in shoot and root tissue by Illumina/Solexa 1G parallel sequencing after digesting genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme and after conducting chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) using antibodies that target specific histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, respectively). Additionally, we profiled RNA pools (micro RNA (miRNA), siRNA and mRNA) using the same sequencing strategy. Keywords: Epigenetics, mRNA transcription and small RNAs

DESIGN
H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, DNA methylation and mRNA, small RNA profiled from shoots and roots of 14 day-old maize B73 seedlings
