TITLE
Oligoarray analysis of semi-global gene expression in ripening Japanese pear fruit

ORGANISM
Pyrus pyrifolia

SUMMARY
A custom oligoarray of Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) based on 9,812 independent ESTs from different tissues (fruits at various growth stages, vegetative and flower tissues) was designed and used for comprehensive investigation of gene expression before and during ripening (105 to 147 days after full bloom).

DESIGN
Gene expression in fruit development of Japanese pear was measured from 105 to 147 days after full bloom (DAFB). 147 DAFB is the optimum maturity for eating. Two to three independent experiments were performed at each time (105 to 147 DAFB) using different trees for each experiment.
