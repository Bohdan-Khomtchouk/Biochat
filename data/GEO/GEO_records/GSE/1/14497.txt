TITLE
Diet and feeding condition induced gene expression in rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study analyzed gene expression of rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells by microarray analysis following different feeding conditions (ad libitum feeding, fasting and refeeding) in normoweight (control) and in diet-induced obese rats (cafeteria rats). The aim of this study was to identify genes and biological pathways that were altered by feeding conditions in normoweight and diet-induced obese rats. Keywords: Dietary treatment, analysis of feeding conditions
