TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of plasmid-induced genes sheds light on the role of type I IFN  as adjuvant in DNA vaccine against infectious salmon anemia virus

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
A previous study showed that a plasmid expressing IFNa (pIFNa) strongly enhanced protection and antibody production of a DNA vaccine against infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) in Atlantic salmon. The vaccine consisted of a plasmid (pHE) expressing the virus hemagglutinin-esterase as an antigen.  To increase the understanding of the adjuvant effect of pIFNa, here compared transcriptome responses in salmon muscle at the injection site at week 1 and 2 after injection of pIFNa, pHE, plasmid control (pcDNA3.3) and PBS,respectively. A major was that both the control plasmid pcDNA3.3 and pHE caused responses similar to pIFNa, but at lower magnitude. Plasmid DNA may thus by itself have adjuvant activity as observed in mammalian models. Notably, pHE had a lower effect on many immune genes including ISGs and chemokines than pcDNA3.3, which suggested an inhibitory effect of the viral protein
