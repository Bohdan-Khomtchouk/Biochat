TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice (Oryza sativa cv.TW16) in relation to infection with rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice tungro disease is caused by the interaction between Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus. Infection with RTSV alone does not result in any distinctive symptoms in TW16 that is one of RTSV resistant indica rice. To elucidate the basis of asymptomatic response of rice to RTSV at the gene expression level, global gene response in RTSV-infected TN1 was detected by custom microarray. Keywords: time course, virus infection, disease response
