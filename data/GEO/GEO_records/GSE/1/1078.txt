TITLE
Microarray-based CGH using BAC clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High resolution BAC array used to study changes in the copy number of chromosome 21 in Acute Meyloid Leukemia patients Genomic DNA from patients as well as from normal donors were differentially labelled and hybridized on the array 36 RPCI-11 BAC clones covering the q-arm of chromosome21 from position15.1MB(close to the centromere)to the telomeric position 46.9 MB with an average gap between clones of 800 kb (range 346-1593 kb)In addition 23 randomly selected clones, each representing 1 of the remaining chromosomes1-20,22,X and YPositions of genes and BAC clones were determined according to the NCBI ( ) 59 BAC clones spotted in 6 replicas for a total 354 spots on GAPII corning glass slides using Affymetrix GMS417 Affymetrix Arrayer with 4-ring & pin configuration. (Affymetrix,Santa Clara, CA). Purified clones spotted in 50%DMSO DNA Isolation of these clones was performed from bacterial culture (250ml) using Qiagen midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) gDNA from AML patients and healthy controls was extracted and labelleb according to the published protocol by JR Pollack in Nature Genetics vol.23 Sep.99, also available Fluorescence intensity ratios were measured in control experiments (reference versus reference hybridization) to weight DNA Amplification or deletion Fluorescence ratio > 1 indicates amplification, Fluorescence ratio < 1 indicate deletion Mean of the background corrected pixel-by-pixel fluorescence ratio between the two dyes at each spot was obtained by genePix software.
