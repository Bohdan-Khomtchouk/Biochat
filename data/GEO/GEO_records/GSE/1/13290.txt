TITLE
Circulating Cells in Coronary Collateral Artery Growth II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we performed transcriptome expression analyses in three independent peripheral blood-derived monocyte subpopulations from patients with chronic coronary occlusions (CTO) and tested for arteriogenesis. Whole-genome mRNA expression analyses were performed on these three monocyte subpopulations, namely: (1) unstimulated-, (2) 3 hours LPS-stimulated-, (3) monocyte-derived macrophages.  Whole-genome mRNA expression analysis amongst others confirmed increased expression of IFNbeta-regulated genes in patients with insufficient coronary collateralization (collateral flow index (CFI) ≤0.37 “nonresponders”), compared with patients having sufficient collateralization (CFI > 0.37 “responders”).
