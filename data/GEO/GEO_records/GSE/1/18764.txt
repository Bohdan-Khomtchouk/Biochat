TITLE
In depth sequencing of the siRNAs associated with peach latent mosaic viroid infection

ORGANISM
Prunus persica

SUMMARY
Using a high-throughput sequencing approach we quantitatively analyzed the content of viroid-derived siRNAs of an infected tree. Our results show that the entire PLMVd genome is found in the siRNA population. Also both polarities are susceptible to be targeted by the RNAi machinery but specific regions for each polarity are over represented. Those regions, that are not the same for each polarity, do not necessarily correlate with double stranded regions that could be substrate for Dicer-like enzymes. Finally the analysis of the first 5â€™ nucleotide revealed a bias toward a C or a U in viroid-derived siRNAs, indicating that at least AGO5 and AGO1 can recruit these small RNAs.
