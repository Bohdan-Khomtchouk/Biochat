TITLE
Transcriptomes in Healthy and Diseased Gingival Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression signatures in healthy and diseased gingival tissues in 90 patients. Analysis of the gingival tissue transcriptome in states of periodontal health and disease may reveal novel insights of the pathobiology of periodontitis. Keywords: gingival tissue disease state analysis
