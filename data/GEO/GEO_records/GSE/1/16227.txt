CAST/EiJ x C57BL/6J cross data

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we introduce a test for lineage-specific selection of cis-regulation that can be applied to any gene set of interest.  Applying the test to hundreds of gene sets in two diverged subspecies of mouse, we find evidence for selection acting on the cis-regulation of several functional classes, including those involved in both physiology (e.g. mitochondria-related genes and growth regulators) and behavior (e.g. locomotory-related genes and memory-related genes).  These positively selected gene sets implicate potential targets of positive selection that are supported by quantitative trait loci, and accurately predict a number of phenotypic differences between the two subspecies, suggesting that the divergence in these traits may have been driven by adaptive evolution.
