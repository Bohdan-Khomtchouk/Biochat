TITLE
Gene expression changes in Jhdm2a knock-out skeletal muscle as compared to wild-type.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in mouse skeletal muscle were assessed in wild-type and Jhdm2a null skeletal muscle in an effort to define the role of Jhdm2a in energy expenditure and metabolism.
