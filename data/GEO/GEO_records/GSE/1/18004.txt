TITLE
Differential gene expression in stellate sympathetic ganglia after cardiac pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptom analysis of stellate sympathetic ganglia after 8 weeks of cardiac pressure overload caused by transverse aortic constriction.

DESIGN
Comparative transcriptome analysis was determined using the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Six microarrays from stellate sympathetic ganglia of mice were performed 8 weeks after transverse aortic constriction or sham operation.
