TITLE
Expression data from ERG Si treated and Control HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG (Ets Related Gene) is an ETS transcription factor that was originally described for its role in a number of human cancers.  Our preliminary data demonstrate that ERG exhibits a highly EC restricted pattern of expression in cultured primary cells and several adult tissues including the heart, lung, and brain.  In response to inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-alpha, we observed a marked reduction of ERG expression in EC. To further define the role of ERG in the regulation of normal EC function we used RNA interference to knockdown ERG.  Knockdown of ERG in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) using siRNA was associated with the reduction of a number known ERG targets. Keywords: SIRNA Functional Role

DESIGN
The functional role of the ERG in the EC cellls was elucidated by comparing gene expression data from HUVEC cells  trasfected with only vector (BERG) , non-sense SiRNA (CERG) vs ERG SiRNA (ERG).
