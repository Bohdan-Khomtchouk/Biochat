TITLE
Innervated and 2 month Denervated Rat EDL muscles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The right legs of 8 Brown-Norway male rats were denervated by a high sciatic nerve section in the hip region of the hind limb.Two months after denervation (6 months of age), extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were removed from the operated legs. The EDL muscles from 8 age-matched non-operated rats served as innervated controls. Total RNA was isolated, labeled cDNA was prepared and hybridized to the Rat Atlas 1.2 Array II membranes (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Keywords: other
