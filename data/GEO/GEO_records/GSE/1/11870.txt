TITLE
Gene expression changes in primary aortic endothelial cells during expression of dominant negative PPAR gamma (V290M).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ligand-mediated activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR gamma lowers blood pressure and improves glucose tolerance in humans.  Two naturally occurring mutations (P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma have been described in humans that lead to severe insulin resistance and hypertension.  Experimental evidence suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative fashion.  To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR gamma action in the vasculature, we determined the global gene expression profile in primary aortic endothelial cells in response to endothelial cell specific expression of a dominant negative isoform of PPAR gamma (V290M).
