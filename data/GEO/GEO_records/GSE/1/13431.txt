TITLE
Gene expression in three independent resynthesized Brassica napus allopolyploid lines and their diploid progenitors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We anlalyzed gene expession using an Arabidopsis 26K 70mer spotted microarray Differential expression was tested using two ANOVA models: 1) a per-gene variance ANOVA, and 2) a common variance ANOVA
