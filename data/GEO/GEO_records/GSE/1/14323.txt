TITLE
RMA expression data for liver samples from subjects with HCV, HCV-HCC, or normal liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely understood, particularly at the molecular level. We studied gene expression in normal, pre-malignant (cirrhosis), and tumor (HCC) liver tissues using Affymetrix GeneChips. Keywords: cross-sectional
