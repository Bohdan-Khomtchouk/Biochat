TITLE
Comparison between caruncular and intercaruncular areas in the endometrium of cyclic and pregnant cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
At implantation the endometrium undergoes dramatic modifications necessary for its physical interactions with the trophoblast as well as the development of the conceptus. We aim to identify endometrial factors and pathways essential for a successful implantation in the caruncular [C] and the intercaruncular [IC] areas in cattle. The [C versus IC] direct comparison revealed 1177 and 453 DEG in cyclic and pregnant animals respectively, with a major impact of the conceptus on metabolism and cell adhesion. Keywords: Microarray fluorescence
