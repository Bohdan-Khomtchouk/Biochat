TITLE
Transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high glucose (20%) concentration

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cells can be affected during their growth to several stress conditions. One of the most known and characterised is the osmotic stress and most of the studies about osmotic sterss response in yeast have been focused on salt or sorbitol stress. However, during yeast growth in industrially relevant processes (for instance throughout alcoholic fermentation on the must to produce alcoholic beverages) the osmotic stress is mainly due to the high sugar(in particular glucose) concentration (200-250 g/L).
