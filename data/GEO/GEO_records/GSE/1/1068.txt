TITLE
2CdA-induced microphthalmia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this dose series pregnant CD-1 (outbred) dams were exposed to the 2-chloro analogue of 2'-deoxyadenosine (a metabolic toxin) on 8 d.p.c. Test doses were developed from a teratological series for 2CdA-induced microphthalmia using BMDS modeling software from the US EPA. Benchmark doses for microarray analysis were: 5.0 mg/kg (25% risk), 2.5 mg/kg (5% risk), 1.25 mg/kg (NOAEL), and 0.625 mg/kg (subNOAEL). All measurements were on RNA from the embryo proper at 3.0h post-treatment.
