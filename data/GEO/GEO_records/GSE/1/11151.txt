TITLE
Gene expression data from different types of renal tumors and normal kidneys

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification and evaluation of specific molecular markers is of great importance for reliable diagnostics and outcome prediction of renal neoplasms Using the Affymetrix microarray, we established the gene expression signatures of normal kidneys and different types of renal tumors. Keywords: Several different biological groups, several samples per group
