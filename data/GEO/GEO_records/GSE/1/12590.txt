TITLE
mRNA expression in TTHA0118 deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown on minimum essential medium

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We compared the expression profile of TTHA0118 deletion mutant strain of Thermus thermophils HB8 with that of wild-type. The mutant strain grown in minimum essential medium (CS medium) exhibited growth retardation. In early log phase, 29 genes were suppressed and 25 genes were activated for the mutant strain. The suppressed genes included genes of electron transport, and cell growth and division. The activated genes included genes of stress response. We suggested that these transcriptional alterations in the mutant cell were induced by the pAp accumulation and mononucleotides starvation.
