TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Escherichia coli rpoS- BW25113 vs. wild-type BW25113 under 15% ethanol shock in log phase

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
RpoS, an alternative sigma factor, is critical for stress response in Escherichia coli.RpoS also acts as a global regulator for stress control of gene expression, and actually dose so in log stage and stationary stage. To further understand the effect of environmental stresses on in ethanologenic strains, DNA microarrys was used to analyze the expression profiles of E. coli and its rpoS mutant strain.
