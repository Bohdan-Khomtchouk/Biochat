TITLE
Expression data from CD4-positive HTLV-positive cell lines and from CD4-positive HTLV-negative primary cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression in HTLV-positive, ATL-derived and HTLV-positive in vitro-transformed cell lines with that of uninfected primary CD4 T cells.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested one day after splitting, in case of primary T cells, cells were harvested after reaching a postmitotic state.
