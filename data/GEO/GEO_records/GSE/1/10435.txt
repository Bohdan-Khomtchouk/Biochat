TITLE
FM95-14 expression verification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Undifferentiated FM95-14 human embryonic myoblasts contain myogenic stem/progenitor cells. Gene expression analysis and comparison to FM95-14 cells that have been allowed to differentiate will allow the ascertainment of genes that are implicated in myogenic lineage commitment. Human myoblast were also differentiated for 4 days. 293FT-human embroynal kidney were used as a human control cell line for human myoblast study. Keywords: other
