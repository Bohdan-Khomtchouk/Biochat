TITLE
Expression data from Neural Progenitor cells cultured on 2D flat surfaces and in 3D scaffolds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A genomic expression comparison was done among neural progenitor cells cultured on 2D substrates, 3D porous polystyrene scaffolds, and as 3D neural spheres (in vivo surrogate), with the goal of assessing the feasibility of establishing the meaning of 3D and associated physiological relevance at the molecular level
