TITLE
Effect of tocopherol on caco-2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Caco-2 cells (clone TC7) were cultured for 15 days post confluence on plastic dishes to reach the differentiation, then cells were treated for 24h with alpha or gamma tocopherol enriched mixed micelles, or mixed micelles alone (as control) (Landrier et al Free Radical Research 2008). Cells were rinced with PBS before RNA extraction with Trizol, according the standard protocol of the manufacturer. RNA were checked for integrity with bioanalyser and quantified with Nanodrop. All others steps (labeling, hydridisation, wash and scan) were perfomed with Agilent kits, scanner and dedicated software.
