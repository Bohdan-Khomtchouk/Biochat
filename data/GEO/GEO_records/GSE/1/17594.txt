TITLE
NOD2 and human ileal gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling of ileal mucosal gene expression in Chron's disease patients with and without NOD2 risk alleles; through microarray analyses it was discovered that 18 genes related to lymphocyte and phagocyte activation recuitment were upregulated in affected ileum in NOD2R patients as compared to ileum in NOD2s (no risk alleles) patients, thus supporting the concept that NOD2 risk alleles contribute to impaired regulation of inflammation in the ileum.

DESIGN
Mucosal biopsies of resected ileum were collected from 8 Crohn's disease patients at risk for NOD2R alleles. The patients were genotyped for the three major NOD2 risk alleles (Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg, Leu1007fs).  Microarray analysis was performed in samples from NOD2R (at least one risk allele) Crohn’s disease patients, NOD2S (no risk alleles) Crohn’s disease patients and NOD2S controls.
