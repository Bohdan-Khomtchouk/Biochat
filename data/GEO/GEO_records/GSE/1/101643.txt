TITLE
Identification of differential gene expression in WT and DGKzeta deficient CD8 T cells by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to identify changes in gene expression between wild type and DGKzeta deficient splenic CD8+ T cells upon sitmulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Methods: mRNA profiles from WT and DGKzeta deficient CD8 T cells were generated.

DESIGN
Comparison of stimulated splenic CD8 T cells from WT and DGKzeta deficient mice.
