TITLE
Effect of AICAR and SAICAR accumulation on global transcription (first part)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of AICAR and SAICAR accumulation on transcriptional regulation of purine biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription analysis on total RNA from cells accumulating or not AICAR and SAICAR nucleotide derivatives.
