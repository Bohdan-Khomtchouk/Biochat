TITLE
Amniotic fluid transcriptomics reflects novel disease mechanisms in fetuses with myelomeningocele

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecular pathophysiologic changes and novel disease mechanisms specific to myelomeningocele by analyzing AFS cfRNA in fetuses with open  myelomeningocele.

DESIGN
AFS was collected from 10 pregnant women at the time of the open myelomeningocele repair in the second trimester (24.5+/-1.0 wks) and 10 archived AFS from sex and gestational age-matched euploid fetuses without myelomeningocele were used as controls (20.9+/-0.9 wks). Differentially regulated gene expression patterns were analyzed using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
