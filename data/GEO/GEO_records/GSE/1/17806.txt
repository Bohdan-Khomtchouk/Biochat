TITLE
Transcriptional maturation of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fast-spiking (FS) interneurons are important elements of neocortical circuitry that constitute the primary source of synaptic inhibition  in adult cortex and impart temporal organization on ongoing cortical activity. The highly specialized intrinsic membrane and firing  properties that allow cortical FS interneurons to perform these functions are attributable to equally specialized gene expression, which is  ultimately coordinated by cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation. Although embryonic transcriptional events govern the initial  steps of cell-type specification in most cortical interneurons, including FS cells, the electrophysiological properties that distinguish adult  cortical cell types emerge relatively late in postnatal development, and the transcriptional events that drive this maturational process are  not known. To address this, we used mouse whole-genome microarrays and whole-cell patch clamp to characterize the transcriptional  and electrophysiological maturation of cortical FS interneurons between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P40. We found that the intrinsic and  synaptic physiology of FS cells undergoes profound regulation over the first 4 postnatal weeks and that these changes are correlated with  primarily monotonic but bidirectional transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes belonging to multiple functional classes. Using  our microarray screen as a guide, we discovered that upregulation of two-pore K leak channels between P10 and P25 contributes to one  of the major differences between the intrinsic membrane properties of immature and adult FS cells and found a number of other  candidate genes that likely confer cell-type specificity on mature FS cells.

DESIGN
We characterized the transcriptional maturation of genetically labeled FS interneurons in mouse S1  cortex using whole-genome microarrays.mRNA was harvested from manually sorted GFPexpressing  neurons dissociated from acutely prepared brain slices  at a range of developmental time points (P7, P10, P15, P25, and  P40) and subsequently reverse transcribed, amplified, labeled,  and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 whole-genome microarrays  (three microarrays from three different animals per condition). We used the G42 transgenic mice described by Chattopadhyaya  et al. (2004) for all experiments.
