TITLE
Gene expression data from NECA (5/-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) treated murine pituitary folliculostellate cells(TtT/GF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Folliculostellate cells constitute as much as 10% of the cells within the anterior pituitary gland; they however do not secrete any of the classical hormones but do express cytokines and growth factors. The endogenous nucleoside adenosine can be either pro- or anti-inflammatory depending on receptor expression and the activation of one or more receptors A1, A2a, A2b and A3. Adenosine stimulates the secretion of immune molecules from folliculostellate; these cells appear to mediate communication between the endocrine and immune systems.
