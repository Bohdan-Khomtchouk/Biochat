SUMMARY
We compared the poly(A) tail length status of mRNAs of HeLa cells expressing a CPEB1 shRNA (CPEB1 knockdown) versus a control shRNA, and expressing a CPEB4 shRNA (CPEB4 knockdown) versus a control shRNA. Results provide insight into the extent of gene regulation mediated by CPEB1 and CPEB4 activity during mitotic cell cycle progression.  The different shRNA expressing cells were synchronized with double thymidine blockade (12 hours with 2 mM thymidine, 12 hours release, and 12 hours with 2 mM thymidine),  and samples were taken after 8 hours release (G2/M phase). For each shRNA expressing HeLa cell line total RNA was purified by two different procedures: poly(U) chromatography and oligo(dT)-chromatography. Poly(U)-chromatography (Jacobson, 1987): 100 μg of total RNA were bound to poly(U)-sepharose (Sigma) and eluted at 35ºC to isolate mRNAs with short poly(A) tail ( < 30As, SHORT fraction). Oligo(dT) chromatography: mRNAs were purified independently of their poly(A) tail length with Ambion Poly(A)Purist kit from 20 μg total RNA (ALL fraction).  Jacobson, A.
