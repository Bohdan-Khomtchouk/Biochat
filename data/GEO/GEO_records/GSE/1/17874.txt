TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila S2 cells depleted of exosome subunits

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The exosome complex and its' subunits are vital for proccessing and or degrading many cellular RNAs. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in mRNA levels in response to exosome subunit depletion.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from dsRNA treated S2 cells and hybridized using Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to obtain a master set of mRNAs surveyed by exosme subunits in vivo.
