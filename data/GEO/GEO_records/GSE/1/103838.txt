TITLE
Expression profiling analyses of ECF sigma factor PG1660 mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
To study the expression profile of ECF sigma factor PG1660 mutant under anaerobic conditions and hydrogen peroxide stress conditions compared to the wild-type W83 by using DNA-microarray. The role of ECF sigma factor PG1660 involved in oxidative stress was published Yuetan Dou, Devon Osbourne, Rachelle McKenzie, Hansel M Fletcher.
