TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for low-grade astrocytoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number analysis of 21 paediatric low-grade astrocytomas identified a discrete copy number gain of 1.9Mb in chromosome band 7q34. The gain was present in 12/14 cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas. Subsequent analysis of tumour cDNA indentified a novel gene fusion between KIAA1549 and BRAF in these tumours.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of 21 paediatric low-grade astrocytomas using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Nsp Array.  This study comprised 14 pilocytic astrocytomas, 4 diffuse astrocytomas, one pilomyxoid astrocytoma, one pilomyxoid glioma and one pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Tumours were compared to the mean of two normal male DNA controls.
