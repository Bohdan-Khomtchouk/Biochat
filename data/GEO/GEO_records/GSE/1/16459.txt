TITLE
circad_pop1-circadian rhythm in the expression of genes involved in the formation of poplar wood

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
affy_orleans_circad - circad_pop1 - Global  transcriptome analysis of tension wood  in poplar over a 24h period. Young differentiating xylem was harvested on the tension wood side of 6 month-old poplar trees grown in greenhouse conditions. The samples were harvested at 6 hour intervals throughout the day. The bioinformatic analysis will permit the identification of genes expressed in tension wood and  that cycle with a nycthemeral oscillation pattern. Keywords: time course
