TITLE
The effect of PPAR-alpha agonist on the gene expression in mice hypothalamus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that bezafibrate, PPAR-alpha agonist, increased EEG delta oscillation throughout 24 hours and decreased body temperature especially in the later half of the dark period in mice. This DNA- microarray experiment was performed due to investigate the gene expression at ZT10, when body temperature showed no difference between nomal- and bezafibrate-treated mice, and ZT22, when body temperature showed the largest difference between the groups. Keywords: drug treatment, time course
