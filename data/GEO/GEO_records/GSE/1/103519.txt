TITLE
SIRT1 expression effect on migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of BGC-823 gastric cancer cells with SIRT1 overexpression or knockdown. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, exerts inhibitory effects on migration and invasion of gastric cancer. Results provide insight into the role of  SIRT1 in the metastasis of gastric cancer.

DESIGN
Four groups: Group 1, Stable lentivirus  infected  BGC-823 cells with the lentiviral expressing vector. Group 2, Stable lentivirus infected BGC-823 cells with the lentiviral  expressing vector containing SIRT1 cDNA sequence. Group 3, Stable lentivirus infected BGC-823 cells with the lentiviral vector containing interference control sequence. Group 4, Stable lentivirus infected BGC-823 cells with the lentiviral vector containing interference sequence targeting SIRT1.
