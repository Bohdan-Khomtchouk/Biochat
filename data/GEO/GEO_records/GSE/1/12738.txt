TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to a low concentration of Azithromycin

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Low-dose macrolides are effective therapy in patients with chronic lung infections, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. We compared global gene expression profiles between P.aeruginosa with and without low-dose Azithromycin (AZM) to study why the low-dose macrolide therapy is effective for cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Keywords: dose-response
