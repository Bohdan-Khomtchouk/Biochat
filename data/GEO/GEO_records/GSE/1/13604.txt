TITLE
8 hours BMP6 treated vs untreated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have established that BMP6 is an important endogenous regulator of human osteoblast differentiation. Our preliminary experiment showed that 8 hour BMP6 treatment induced early osteoblast markers in hMSC. In this study, we used microarrays to profile the global gene expression program in hMSC induced by BMP6 treatment and further identify the early osteogenic responses to BMP6 stimulation.
