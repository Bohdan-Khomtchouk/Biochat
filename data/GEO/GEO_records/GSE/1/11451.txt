TITLE
OsGLK1 regulated genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcription factors encoded by GLK genes are putative positive regulators of chloroplast development. To identify the potential downstream genes regulated by OsGLK1, we performed the rice 44k oligo microarray analysis. Keywords: over-expression of full-length cDNAs
