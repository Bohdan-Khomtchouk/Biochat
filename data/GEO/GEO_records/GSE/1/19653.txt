TITLE
Temporal dysregulation of cortical gene expresssion in the isolation-reared Wistar rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The critical sequence of molecular, neurotransmission and synaptic disruptions that underpin the emergence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia remain to be established with progress only likely using animal models that capture key features of such disorders. Gene expression was assessed in social control and isolation reared rats at 4 increasing postnatal ages to relate gene expression dysregulation to behavioural and endophenotype emergence.

DESIGN
We prepared cDNA from brain tissue samples of the medial prefrontal cortex from socially reared Wistar rats (Soc) and matching isolation reared cohorts (Iso) at postnatal day (P) 30, 40, 60 and 80.
