TITLE
Genome analysis of C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from different regions of the same pig

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
C. coli is the predominant Campylobacter strain that is found in pigs while C. jejuni if present will be 10- 100 folds less. Natural transformation can occur if there is a coexistence of both the strains in the intestine of pigs. Genome analyses were performed on a C. jejuni strain U101 isolated from the upper intestine and two C. coli strains, C101 and L101 isolated from caecum and lower intestine.
