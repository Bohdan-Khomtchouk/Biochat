TITLE
Time course of NHBE cells exposed to whole cigarette smoke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns were assessed in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells exposed to cigarette smoke from a reference cigarette (2R4F, University of Kentucky) and a typical American brand of " light " cigarettes ( " Lights " ) in order to develop a better understanding of the genomic impact of tobacco exposure, which can ultimately define biomarkers that discriminate tobacco-related effects and outcomes in a clinical setting.  NHBE cells were treated with whole cigarette smoke for 15 minutes and alterations to the transcriptome assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-exposure using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: time course, cigarette smoke exposure
