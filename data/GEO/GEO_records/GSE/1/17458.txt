TITLE
Identification of transcription factor HLH-8 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for HLH-8 at L3 stage, which is required for normal muscle development and normal defecation and egg-laying.
