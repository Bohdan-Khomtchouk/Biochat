TITLE
Role of the Snf1p protein kinase in the transcriptional response associated to AICAR and SAICAR accumulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of Snf1p in the transcriptional response associated to AICAR and SAICAR accumulation. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription analysis on total RNA from cells accumulating or not AICAR and SAICAR nucleotide derivatives in a snf1 deletion context.
