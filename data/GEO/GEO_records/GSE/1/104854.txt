TITLE
Ribosome-free RNA sequencing of long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs in lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Noncoding RNAs play important roles in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer. Expression profile of circular RNAs (circRNA) is largely unknown in lung adenocarcinoma. This study is designed to explore mRNA, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and circRNA in lung adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
9 pairs of lung adenocarcinoma tissues and paired nontumor tissues were collected. Every 3 tumor and every 3 nontumor tissues were pooled together for RNA sequencing, and 6 samples were sequenced. Primary lung adenocarcinoma tissues and paired nontumor tissues were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after resection and stored in liquid nitrogen till RNA extraction.
