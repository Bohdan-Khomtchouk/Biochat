TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of the Metanephric Kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we identify molecules with highly restricted expression patterns during the initial stages of metanephric development, when the ureteric bud has entered the metanephric mesenchyme and initiated branching morphogenesis. Using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, we compare gene expression patterns in ureteric bud tips, stalks and metanephric mesenchymes from mouse E12.5 embryos. To identify conserved molecular pathways, we also analyze transcriptional profiles in rat E13.5 ureteric buds and metanephric mesenchymes using the Affymetrix Rat Genome U34 Set. Taken together, these data sets help to identify conserved and highly localized transcripts in the metanephric kidney.
