TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between follicular thyroid adenoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular thyroid tumours were investigated using global gene expression analysis. Aim of this study was the identification of new markers for follicular thyroid carcinoma. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 4 follicular thyroid adenomas, 4 follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 4 microinvasive follicular thyroid carcinomas.
