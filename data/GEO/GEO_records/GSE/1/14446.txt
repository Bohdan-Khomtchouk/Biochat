TITLE
Gene expression of lpp2 KO mutant in response to ABA.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic study of lpp2 KO mutant in response to abcsisic acid - Fully developed rosette leaves were immersed for 1 min in a solution of 10-5 M ABA with 0.1% DMSO and 0.05%silwet. RNA are extracted after a 3h incubation. This treatment is compared to control (1 min immersion in 0.1% DMSO and 0.05%silwet) then 3h incubation. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
