TITLE
GPR30-mediated estrogen signaling in Estrogen Receptor alpha and beta negative SKBR3 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses were carried out to identify genes regulated by 17-beta estradiol (E2) and Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) through GPR30 in SKBR3 cells, a breast cancer cell-line which expresses GPR30 but lacks Estrogen Receptor alpha or beta. Keywords: Gene expression analysis, Non-genomic signaling in breast cancer cells.
