TITLE
Nutrient limitation-induced regulation of Phanaerochaete chrysosporium genes

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP-78

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on carbon-limited medium, nitrogen-limited medium and replete medium. Array design based on the DoE's Joint Genome Institute's v2.1 annotation. Goal is to define genes involved in lignin degradation. Keywords: gene expression under three different culture conditions
