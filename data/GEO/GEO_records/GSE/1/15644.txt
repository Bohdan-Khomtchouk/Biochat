TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of stage specific monocyte derived dendritic cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) modulate a multitude of cellular events.  Here, we identify functional miRNA-protein networks that regulate human monocyte-derived dendritic cell (MDDC) differentiation. MiRNA profiling revealed stage-specific differential expression of 20 miRNAs during days 1, 3 and 5 of MDDC differentiation. To identify and prioritize miRNA-protein networks for functional validation, we developed a target ranking algorithm that incorporates many features of miRNA regulatory networks.  This system prioritized miR-21, miR-34a, and their cognate targets WNT1 and JAG1 for functional validation. Inhibition of both miR-21 and miR-34a stalled MDDC differentiation, as quantified by DC-SIGN/CD14 expression ratios, showing cooperative involvement of these miRNAs in MDDC differentiation.  We confirmed that the 3â€™ UTRs of WNT1 and JAG1 were functional targets of these miRNAs and provide evidence that these targets were translationally suppressed.  Significantly, exogenously added Wnt-1 and Jagged-1 also stalled MDDC differentiation, suggesting that miRNA mediated inhibition of endogenous WNT1 and JAG1 expression was important for proper MDDC differentiation. Finally, inhibition of miR-21 and miR-34a, or addition of Wnt-1 and Jagged-1 led to a decrease in endocytic capacity, a key function of immature DCs.  Thus, our novel approach identified and validated some miRNA-protein networks involved in phenotypic and functional MDDC differentiation.
