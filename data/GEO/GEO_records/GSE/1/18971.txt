SUMMARY
Background: p53 plays a key role in determining the clinical features of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Disruption of p53 by point mutations, deletion at 17p13, or both, occurs in a fraction of cases at diagnosis and predicts poor survival and chemorefractoriness. In cells with functional p53, p53 activity is inhibited through interaction with MDM2. In fact, p53 can be activated upon exposure of cells to inhibitors of p53/MDM2 interaction, like Nutlins. Exposure of CLL cells to Nutlin-3 is effective in raising the levels of p53 protein with subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, independently of the most relevant prognostic markers. Specific gene-sets and GEP were documented to be associated with response or resistance to Nutlin-3 exposure in p53(wt) or p53(del/mut) CLL. These findings may help to identify novel molecular targets for CLL therapy.  Aim: to analyze the gene expression profile (GEP) induced by Nutlin-3 exposure in primary CLL cells from p53(wt) and p53(del/mut) cases.  Methods: purified cells from 24 PB CLL samples, all characterized for IGHV mutational status, CD38 and ZAP-70 and p53 mutations (16 p53(wt) CLL, 8 p53(del/mut) CLL of which 6 with del17p13 and p53 mutations, 1 with del17p13 alone, and 1 with p53 mutations alone), were exposed to 10 uM Nutlin-3 for 24 hours. GEP was performed using a dual labelling strategy; the differential expression of the below reported genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR.   specific gene-sets and GEP were documented to be associated with response or resistance to Nutlin-3 exposure in p53(wt) or p53(del/mut) CLL. These findings may help to identify novel molecular targets for CLL therapy.
