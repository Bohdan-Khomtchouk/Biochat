TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the eukaryotic-type ser/thr kinase PknB in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus N315

SUMMARY
The function of the Staphylococcus aureus eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase PknB was investigated by transcriptome analysis using DNA-microarray technology and biochemical assays. The transcriptional profile reveals a strong regulatory impact of PknB on the expression of genes encoding proteins which are involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, and glutamine synthesis.
