TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of human neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate global changes of miRNA profiles upon differentiation of human neural stem cells, we applied massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology to an immortalized neural stem cell (HB1.F3) and its differentiated cell (F3.Olig2) lines. We identified 339 known miRNAs, out of which 170 miRNAs are up-regulated in F3.Olig2, while only 59 miRNAs in HB1.F3. We also identified 150 novel miRNA candidates.
