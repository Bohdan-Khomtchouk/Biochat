Interactions of cytokines in peripheral blood cells from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

SUMMARY
SLE patients are always with various disease manifestation. Various cytokines are pointed interacting and playing pathological roles in SLE although the etiopathology is still obscure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of cytokine interactions in the immune response of SLE patients. Overexpressed interferon-inducible(IFI) genes were confirmed in peripheral blood from SLE patients. Using network-based analysis on the immune response-related genes, several networks including cytokines such as TNF and IFN-γ, or beta-estradiol(E2), were constructed. TNF-regulated genes were dominant in these networks but in vitro TNF stimulation on PBMCs showed no different responses in the expressions of these genes between SLE and healthy individuals. Co-stimulating experiments by TNF, IFN-γ, and E2 with IFN-α, revealed that TNF has repressive while IFN-γ essentially has synergistic effect with IFN-α on IFI gene expressions in vitro. E2 showed different effects on IFI gene expressions among 3 individuals.
