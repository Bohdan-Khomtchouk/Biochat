TITLE
The prominent transcriptional changes of Mycobacterium bovis BCG str. Tokyo 172 following induction by vitamin B1

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis

SUMMARY
Vitamin B1 (VB1) is a key dietary nutrient and crucial cofactor, which exhibits a series of regulatory functions on cellular processes and the activation of the immune system. To date, the precise effect of VB1 on Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been fully described. In the present study, the direct influence of VB1 treatment on M. bovis BCG was determined using RNA-sequencing. The selection of this strain was used due to its common physiological features with M.tuberculosis. The investigation of the M. bovis BCG transcription demonstrated significant changes in certain metabolic and cellular process such as the decrease in fatty acid, cholesterol and glycolipid catabolism, the decrease in DNA replication and protein translation, the reduction in cell division and cell wall formation and the induction of arginine biosynthesis. In addition, growth assays indicated that VB1 inhibited the BCG growth rate in vitro, whereas LC/MS analysis demonstrated that the concentration of arginine was higher following VB1 supplementation. It is suggested that VB1 could be used for the treatment of tuberculosis potentially.
