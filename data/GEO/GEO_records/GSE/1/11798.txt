Effects of Prenatal Tobacco Exposure on Gene Expression Profiling in Umbilical Cord Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maternal smoking doubles the risk of delivering a low birth weight infant. The purpose of this study was to analyze differential gene expression in umbilical cord tissue as a function of maternal smoking, with an emphasis on growth-related genes.  We recruited  15 pregnant smokers and 15 women  who never smoked during pregnancy to participate  RNA was isolated from umbilical cord tissue collected and snap frozen at the time of delivery.  Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.Six hundred seventy-eight probes corresponding to 545 genes were differentially expressed (i.e., an intensity ratio that exceeded +/-1.3 and a corrected significance value p < 0.005) in tissue obtained from smokers versus nonsmokers.  Genes important for fetal growth, angiogenesis, or development of connective tissue matrix were up-regulated among smokers. The most highly up-regulated gene was CSH1, a somatomammotropin gene.  Two other somatomammotropin genes (CSH2 and CSH-L1) were also up-regulated. The most highly down-regulated gene was APOBEC3A; other down-regulated genes included those that may be important in immune and barrier protection. PCR validation of the three somatomammotropin genes showed a high correlation between qPCR and microarray expression. Consequently, maternal smoking may be associated with altered gene expression in the offspring. Keywords: substance exposure analysis
