TITLE
Expression in arp6 and swr1 deletion mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Actin-related proteins are ubiquitous components of chromatin remodelers, and are conserved from yeast to man. We have examined the role of the budding yeast actin-related protein Arp6 in gene expression, both as a component of the SWR1 complex (SWR-C) and in its absence. We mapped Arp6-binding sites genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation in mutant and wild-type cells. We find that the majority of Arp6-binding sites in euchromatin coincide with binding sites of Swr1, the catalytic subunit of SWR-C, and with the histone H2A variant Htz1. However, the remaining Arp6 binding in telomeres, centromeres, and the promoters of ribosomal protein (RP) genes are independent of Swr1 and Htz1 deposition. We show that Arp6 can position chromatin at nuclear pores, and is required for the pore association of the RP genes to which it binds. This anchoring is also independent of Swr1. Loss of Arp6, but not Htz1, leads to an up-regulation of RP genes and loss of relocalization. This is in contrast to the Htz1-mediated pore-association of GAL1, for which loss of Arp6 impairs activation. Given that Arp6 is required for SWR-C dependent deposition of Htz1, we conclude that Arp6 contributes to both H2AZ-dependent and H2AZ-independent association with nuclear pores and subsequent effects on gene expression. These data illustrate how nuclear actin-related proteins contribute to the long-range organization of chromatin domains in the interphase nucleus.

DESIGN
Four replicates for the arp6 deletion mutant and three replicates for the swr1 deletion mutant compared to wild-type.
