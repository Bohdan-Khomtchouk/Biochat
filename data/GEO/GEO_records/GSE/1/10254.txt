TITLE
Lactococcus lactis stringent response

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
The stringent response was defined in Lactococcus lactis through transcript profiling after the addition of a chemical inductor, the norvaline. Gene expression was measured in the exponential growth phase (reference sample) and at 1.6 h after norvaline addition. Four hundred and sixty one differentially expressed genes were identified and constituted the stringent response regulon. Keywords: stress response, time course
