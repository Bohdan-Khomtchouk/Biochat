SUMMARY
In this study, we present a case of parotid gland de novo carcinosarcoma. Salivary gland carcinosarcoma (or true malignant mixed tumor) is a rare biphasic neoplasm, composed of both malignant epithelial and malignant mesenchymal components. It is yet unclear whether these two phenotypes occur by collision of two independent tumors or if they are of clonal origin. To analyze the clonality of the different morphologic tumor components, oligonucleotide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (oaCGH) was performed on the carcinoma and the sarcoma entity separately. This technique enables a high-resolution, genome-wide overview of the chromosomal alterations in the distinct tumor elements. Analysis of both fractions showed a high number of DNA copy number changes. Losses were more prevalent than gains (82 and 49, respectively). The carcinomatous element displayed more chromosomal aberrations than the sarcomatous component.  Specific amplifications of MUC20 (in mesenchymal element) and BMI-1 (in both elements) loci were observed. Overall homology between the two genomic profiles was 75%. DNA copy number profiles of the epithelial and mesenchymal components in this salivary gland carcinosarcoma displayed extensive overlap, indicating a monoclonal origin. Since losses are shared to a larger extent than gains, they seem to be more essential for initial oncogenic events. Furthermore, specific amplifications of a mucin and a Polycomb group gene imply these proteins in the tumorigenesis of carcinosarcomas.
