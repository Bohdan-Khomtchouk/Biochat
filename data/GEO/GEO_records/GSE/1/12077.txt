TITLE
Androgen dependent gene expression profiling of the urogenital sinus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established during lineage commitment in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a readily manipulable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression changes in the murine prostate rudiment (Urogenital Sinus, UGS) at three time points during the first 48 hours of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding mesenchyme. Keywords: time course, prostate gland development
