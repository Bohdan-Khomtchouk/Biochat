TITLE
Analysis of milk removal frequency on bovine mammary gene expression

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Regulation of milk synthesis and secretion is controlled mostly through local (intra-mammary) mechanisms. To gain insight into the molecular pathways comprising this response, an analysis of mammary gene expression was conducted in 12 lactating cows shifted from twice daily to once daily milking. Tissues were sampled by biopsy from adjacent mammary quarters of these animals during the two milking frequencies, allowing changes in gene expression to be assessed within each animal. Using bovine-specific, oligonucleotide arrays representing 21,495 unique transcripts, a range of differentially expressed genes were found as a result of less frequent milk removal.

DESIGN
A total of 12 microarrays were used in this study. Each array was hybridized with RNA derived from a mammary sample taken at each biopsy time point, such that the twice-a-day milked sample and once-a-day milked sample were contained on the same slide for each animal (12 animals). Six of the microarrays represented animals previously shown to demonstrate a ‘large’ reduction in milk yield, whereas the other six arrays represented animals that previously displayed a ‘small’ reduction in milk yield when milked once per day. Half of each yield loss group (three animals) was represented by once-a-day milked/twice-daily-milked samples for Cy5/Cy3 labelling, with the other half labelled with the opposite dye configuration. This meant that six of 12 arrays were 'dye swapped', but with biological replicates as opposed to identical replicates.
