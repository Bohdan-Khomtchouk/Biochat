TITLE
Changes in gene expression of granulocytes during in vivo G-CSF/dexamethasone mobilization.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of healthy donors with G-CSF and dexamethasone, results in sufficient number of circulating granulocytes to prepare granulocyte concentrates for clinical purposes. Granulocytes obtained this way demonstrate relatively normal functional behavior combined with a prolonged life span. To study the influence of mobilizing agents on granulocytes, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in mobilized granulocytes as compared to control ones. Keywords: mobilized granulocytes, G-CSF/dexamethasone treated granulocytes
