TITLE
Identification of spondylarthropathy-specific genes in BALB/c mice with proteoglycan-induced spondylitis (PGIS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BALB/c mice develop peripheral arthritis (PGIA) and spondyloarthropathy (PGIS) upon repeated intraperitoneal injections of human cartilage proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan. The aim of the present study was to identify spondylitis-specific genes by comparing intervertebral disc (IVD) RNA samples from spondyloarthropathic and na√Øve BALB/c mice. Keywords: Genetic modification
