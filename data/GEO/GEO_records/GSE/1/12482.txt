SUMMARY
Stem cells self-renew or differentiate under the governance of a stem cell-specific transcriptional program with each transcription factor orchestrating the activities of a particular set of genes. Here we demonstrate that a single transcription factor is able to regulate distinct core circuitries in two different blastocyst-derived stem cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) and extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) cells. The transcription factor, Sall4, is required for early embryonic development and for ES cell pluripotency. Sall4 is also expressed in XEN cells and depletion of Sall4 disrupts self-renewal and induces differentiation. Genome-wide analysis reveals Sall4 is regulating different gene sets in ES and XEN cells, and depletion of Sall4 targets in the respective cell types induces differentiation. With Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, Sall4 forms a crucial interconnected auto-regulatory network in ES cells. In XEN cells, Sall4 regulates key XEN lineageassociated genes, Gata4, Gata6, Sox7 and Sox17. Our findings demonstrate how Sall4 functions as an essential stemness factor for two different stem cell lines.
