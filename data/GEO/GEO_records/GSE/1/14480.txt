TITLE
Phytophthora infestans gene expression during potato infection 2-5 days post inoculation

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The expression of genes in P. infestans was monitored over a five day time course of a potato infection. Genes encoding known and putative effector proteins were found induced at two days post-inoculation with expression decaying over the five day time course.
