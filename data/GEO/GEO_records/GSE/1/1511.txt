TITLE
Gene expression profile of CD56dimCD16+, CD56brightCD16- and activated CD56+CD16+ human NK subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pooled purified peripheral blood derived CD56dimCD16+ NK, CD56brightCD16- NK and in vitro activated CD56+CD16+ NK subsets obtained from 9 healthy donors were analyzed for gene expression pattern. Each pooled NK subset sample was hybridized in replicates (A and B). Keywords: other
