TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of growth perturbations of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The microarray experiments were carried out using a long oligonucleotide DNA microarray that represent all 5363 P. falciparum genes with one oligonucleotide per 1.9kb of coding sequence on average (Hu et al. 2007). Total 247 microarray experiments were carried out including 29-drug treatment time courses with 20 compounds and corresponding untreated controls from different drug or inhibitor treatment. Data of each drug/inhibitor experiment were normalized using a linear normalization and background filtering as implemented by the NOMAD database ( ).
