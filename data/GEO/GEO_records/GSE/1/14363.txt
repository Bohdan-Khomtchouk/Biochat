TITLE
Expression data from adipocytes and white adipose tissue of mice maintained on normal chow or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied the role of the cAMP responsive factor CREB in promoting insulin resistance following its activation in adipose under obese conditions We identified genes that were upregulated in primary cultures of mouse adipocytes following exposure to forskolin; and we characterized genes that are also induced in white adipose tissue in mice maintained on a  high fat diet. Keywords: signaling study
