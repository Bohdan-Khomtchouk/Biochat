TITLE
Analysis of Endoglin function in rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Endoglin is a transmembrane receptor able to bind several members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamliy. We used a siRNA-mediated knock down approach to analyse the function of Endoglin in hepatic stellate cells (HSC). We found that the targeted disruption is associated with significant changes in gene expression resulting in cellular changes that prolongated cellular activation, morphological maturation, transdifferentiation, expression of basement and fibrillar extracellular matrix proteins. In addition, the lack of Endoglin resulted in rearrangements of cytoskeletal organization. Keywords: gene function analysis, siRNA, gene knock down
