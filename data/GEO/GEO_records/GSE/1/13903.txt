SUMMARY
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is involved in several inflammatory conditions including periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the global gene expression profile of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) stimulated human gingival fibroblasts, focusing on signal pathways related to PGE2 production and the new PGE2-synthesizing enzymes, prostaglandin E synthases (PGES). The expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as well as the upstream cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was up-regulated by TNFalpha, accompanied by increased PGE2 production. In contrast, the expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-2 (mPGES-2) and cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (cPGES) was unaffected by TNFalpha. Using microarray analysis in a time-course factorial design including time points 1, 3 and 6 h, we identified differentially expressed genes in response to TNFalpha treatment. Enrichment analysis of microarray data identified two positively regulated signal transduction pathways: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). We used specific inhibitors and phosphorylation analysis to confirm their role in PGE2 regulation. Both JNK and NF-kappaB inhibitors reduced the TNFalpha-stimulated up-regulation of mPGES-1 and COX-2 as well as subsequent PGE2 production. The novel finding that TNFalpha-stimulated mPGES-1 is regulated by JNK suggests this kinase as a potential future target for treatment strategies in inflammatory disorders, including periodontitis. Keywords: Time course, gene expression, factorial design.
