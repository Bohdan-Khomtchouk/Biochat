TITLE
RNA-sequencing of Mbd3-null and control haematopoietic stem cell and lymphoid progenitor cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the role of Mbd3/NuRD in lymphopoiesis, gene expression in purified populations of Mbd3-deleted and control lymphoid progenitor cells was analysed using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Mbd3-deficient and control lymphoid progenitors were isolated from mouse bone marrow by flow cytometry, including haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs), all-lymphoid progenitors (ALPs) and B cell-biased lymphoid progenitors (BLPs). RNA-seq was performed on 100 HSCs or 150 cells from the other populuations, using the previously described smartseq2 protocol for RNA-seq of small numbers of cells (Picelli et al. (2014) Nature protocols 9:171).
