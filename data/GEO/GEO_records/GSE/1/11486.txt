TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Salmonella typhimurium wt, hfq and smpB mutants in four different growth conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
S. typhimurium 14028 wt, hfq and smpB were harvested from log phase LB (LBlog); (2), stationary phase LB (LBstat); (3) 4h MgM medium pH 5.0 after resuspension of LB stat culture (MgMshock); and (4) log phase MgM medium pH5.0 after 100fold dilution of an LB stat culture (MgMDil). Total RNA was extracted, cDNA labeled and hybridized to a non-redundant Salmonella whole genome PCR product ORF array.
