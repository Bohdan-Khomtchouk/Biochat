Physiological defects associated with short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC)

SUMMARY
PRC, a member of the PGC-1 coactivator family, is responsive to serum growth factors and up regulated in proliferating cells. Here, we investigated its in vivo role by stably silencing PRC expression with two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA#1 and shRNA#4) that were lentivirally introduced into U2OS cells. ShRNA#1 transductants exhibited nearly complete knockdown of PRC protein whereas shRNA#4 transductants expressed PRC protein at approximately 15 percent of the control level. Complete PRC silencing by shRNA#1 resulted in a severe inhibition of respiratory growth, reduced expression of respiratory protein subunits from complexes I, II, III and IV, markedly lower complex I and IV respiratory enzyme levels and diminished mitochondrial ATP production. Surprisingly, shRNA#1 transductants exhibited a striking proliferation of abnormal mitochondria that were devoid of organized cristae and displayed severe membrane abnormalities. Although shRNA#4 transductants had normal respiratory subunit expression and a moderately diminished respiratory growth rate, both transductants showed markedly reduced growth on glucose accompanied by inhibition of G1/S cell cycle progression. Microarray analysis revealed striking overlaps in the genes affected by PRC silencing in the two transductants and the functional identities of these overlapping genes were consistent with the observed mitochondrial and cell growth phenotypes. The consistency between phenotype and PRC expression levels in the two independent transductant lines argues that the defects result from PRC silencing and not from off target effects. These results support a role for PRC in the integration of pathways directing mitochondrial respiratory function and cell growth.
