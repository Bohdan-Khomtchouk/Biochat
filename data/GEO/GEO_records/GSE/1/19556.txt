TITLE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the transcriptional program that governs terminal granulocytic differentation in vivo, we performed comprehensive microarray analysis of human bone marrow population highly enriched for promyelocytes, myelocytes / metamyelocytes and neotrophils.
