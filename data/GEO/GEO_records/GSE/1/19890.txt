TITLE
miRNA expression after moderate Spinal Cord Injury in Rats

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of temporal variations in miRNA expression after spinal cord injury caused by thoracic (T8) moderate (200 Kdynes) contusion. Expression changes were analyzed 1, 3 and 7 days after injury and compared to expression of control (untreated) and sham (laminectony but no contusion) individuals.
