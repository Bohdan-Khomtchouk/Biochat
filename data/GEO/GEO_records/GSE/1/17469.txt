TITLE
Gene expression profiling in wMelPop-infected Aedes aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling comparing  Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia sp. wMelPop (PGYP1) to an uninfected Ae. aegypti control line (PGYP1.tet). The objective of the experiment was to identify genes that may be involved in the life shortening phenotype associated with wMelPop infection.
