TITLE
Osmotic stress in Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b strain F2365 grown in BHI medium and BHI medium with 1.2% NaCl

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes strain F2365 to osmotic stress was examined. Based on a log2 scale, four and 24 genes were upregulated and downregulated by the stress, respectively.The expression level of ATP-binding cassette superfamily and ribosomal protein L2 genes were increased, whereas genes associated with PTS system, its metabolic enzymes, pathogenesis, and hypothetical protein were downregulated.
