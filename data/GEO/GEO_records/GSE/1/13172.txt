TITLE
Mismatch oligonucleotides in human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tiled regions surrounding 5 human genes as 36mers, HBG2, TIMP3, SYN3, FLNA, FBX07. The first three of these genes, we tiled with various mismatch oligos in addition to 'perfect match' oligos. Keywords: Mismatch hybridization experiment
