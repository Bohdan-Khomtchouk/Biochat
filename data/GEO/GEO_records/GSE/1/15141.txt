TITLE
EGR1 regulates metastatic potential of v-src transformed chicken sarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
A model of tumor metastasis based on v-src transformed immortalized cell lines was developed. The model consists of highly metastatic PR9692 cell line and a derived clone PR9692-E9 which has lost the metastatic abilities. Introduction of exogenous EGR1 gene into the non-metastasizing PR9692-E9 cells completely restores the metastatic potential. Revealed changes in gene expression provide insight into the molecular mechanisms contolling metastatic behavior of sarcoma cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression profiles obtained from highly metastatic PR9692 cell line, derived non-metastatic clone PR9692-E9 and non-metastatic PR9692-E9 cells infected with replication-defective retroviral vector SFCVneo-EGR1 containing full length cDNA of EGR1. For each condition three biological replicates were analyzed.
