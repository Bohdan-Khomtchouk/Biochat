TITLE
Photoperiod regulation of grape bud dormancy

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Bud endodormancy induction response of two genotypes (‘Seyval’ a hybrid white wine grape and V. riparia, PI588259 a native north american species) was compared under long (15h) and short (13h) photoperiod. Three separate replicates (5 plants/replicate) were treated to generate paradormant (LD) and same aged endodormancy-induced (SD) buds for transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis. Potted, spur-pruned two to six-year-old vines were removed from cold storage (Seyval 3-19-07; V. riparia 3/26/07) and grown under a LD (15 h) at 25/20 + 3C day/night temperatures (D/N). When vines reached 12-15 nodes (3-25-07) they were randomized into LD or SD treatments with 25/20 + 3C D/N in climate controlled greenhouses with automated photoperiod system (VRE Greenhouse Systems). Three replications (5 vines/replication) were harvested between 5/07-6/07 and then again in 5/08-6/08 for a total of six replications. All treatments are repeated at the same time every year and harvested at the same time of day each year to minimize biological noise. At 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days of LD and SD treatment, buds were harvested from nodes 3 to 12 of each separate replicate, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and placed at -80C for future RNA, protein and metabolite extraction. These time points encompass early reversible phases as well as key time points during transition to irreversible endodormancy development. After photoperiod treatments and bud harvests, all pruned vines were returned to LD and monitored for bud endodormancy. The endodormant vines were identified after 28 days and moved to cold storage. The nondormant vines were allowed to grow again and induced into dormancy at a later date.
