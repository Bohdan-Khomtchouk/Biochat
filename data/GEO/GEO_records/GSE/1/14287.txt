TITLE
Expression data from precisely staged blastula wild-type and haploid Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In most embryos, the mid-blastula transition is a complex process featuring maternal RNA degradation, cell cycle pause, zygotic transcriptional activation and morphological changes. The nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio has been proposed to control the multiple events at MBT. To understand the global transcriptional response to the changes of the N/C ratio, we profiled wild type and haploid embryos using cDNA microarrays at three developmental stages. Keywords: time course and different genotype
