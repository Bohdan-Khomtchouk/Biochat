TITLE
Defining the molecular basis of dendritic cell mediated tolerance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a TCR transgenic transplantation model a series of differently modulated bmDC (IL10, TGFb and VD3 treated, +/-LPS) were established that could mediate tolerance following adaptive transfer.  These modified cells, in contrast to untreated 'immature' bmDC retained their capacity to tolerise following exposure to LPS.  The unmodified, non-tolerogenic, LPS-treated cells provided a comparator population to facilitate investigation into molecular expression patterns that correlate with functional phenotype. Keywords: pattern searching, immune tolerance, dendritic cell
