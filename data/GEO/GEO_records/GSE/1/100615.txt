TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Pml wt and Pml KO mice liver after fasted 6h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Pml gene is essential to the formation of PML nuclear bodies, domains which have been associated with various functions such as apoptosis/senescence, DNA repair and cell proliferation( Lallemand-Breitenbach 2010). PML-NBs formation is regulated by cellular stress including oxidative stress(Jeanne 2010, de The 2012).  To investigate the role of PML in ROS response in vivo, we analyse the expression difference betweem Pml wt and Pml KO under fasted condition, which easily up-regulate ROS in BALB/cByJ background

DESIGN
Liver samples were collected from Pml wt and Pml KO ad libitum(2 each) or fasted for 6 hours(3 each). Samples are stabilized in RNAlater and stored in -20Â°C.  Two ad libitum samples are used as a control. Fasted samples are 3 each genotype. Total RNA samples were extracted using QIagen kit.  Gene expression analysis was done in the plateform of Institute Curie using Affmetrix
