TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of piRNAs during testicular development and spermatogenesis of Mongolian horse

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), have been identifed in mammalian testes, and were essential for development of testis and spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
In order to study those physiological processes, the 3 immature and 3 mature testis of Mongolian horse were collected and 6 libraries were established, using Small RNA sequencing technology, the related piRNAs of Mongolian horse development of testis and spermatogenesis were detected.
