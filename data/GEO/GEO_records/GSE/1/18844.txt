TITLE
Expression consequences of decoy vs scrambled oligonucleotides harboring AAAA[AGT]TT motif in MBA-MD-231 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dual-color transcriptional profiling of decoy-transfected cells, harboring AAAA[AGT]TT motif, versus scrambled-transfected cells as controls.

DESIGN
Dual-color experiment, decoy-transfected vs. scrambled-transfected. Biological replicates: 2 sets of decoys and scrambled ds-oligonucleotides
