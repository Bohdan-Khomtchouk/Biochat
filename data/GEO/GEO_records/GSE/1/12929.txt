TITLE
PPARg dependent expression changes during differentiation of 3T3L1 cell into adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled PPARg dependent gene expression changes during differntiation of 3T3L1 cell using PPARg siRNA 3T3-L1 (Pre-adipocyte) cell line was induced to differentiate using standard adipocyte differentiation media (IBMX, Dex and Insulin) 48hrs post-confluency. RNA was harvested at day -2 (confluent fibroblasts), 48hrs post-induction with IBMX, DEX and Insulin (day=0) and for each subsequent day after rosiglitazone treatment. Illumina beadchip microarrays were used to determine expression profiles of genes differentially regulated in cells transfected with either siRNA targeting PPARgamma or a non-targeting control siRNA.
