TITLE
Expression data from mediastinal lymph nodes of piglets experimentally infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study aimed to characterize differences in gene expression in piglets inoculated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the essential causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Comparisons between control and PCV2-inoculated pigs were done at five different time points: 1, 2, 5, 8, and 29 days post-inoculation. Keywords: longitudinal

DESIGN
Seven-day-old caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were distributed into two groups: control (n=8) and inoculated with 105.2 TCID50 of the Burgos PCV2 isolate (n=16). One control and 3 inoculated pigs were necropsied on days 1, 2, 5, and 8 post-infection (p.i.), the remaining pigs (4 of each group) were necropsied on day 29 p.i.
