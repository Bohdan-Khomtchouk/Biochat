TITLE
C2C12 culture: myogenesis timecourse and shRp58 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To predict Rp58-regulated gene involved in myogenesis, RNA profiling experiments were performed, comparing RNA derived from C2C12 with or without expressing shRNA for Rp58. As a result, 271 genes were upregulated in C2C12 stably expressing shRNA-Rp58 cells compared with control C2C12 cells. As Rp58 is repressor in C2C12, we hypothesized that Rp58 regulates gene cluster which expression is downregulated in accordance with Rp58 expression and myogenesis progression. In this regard, we also characterized dynamic gene expression patterns during myogenesis by microarray at 4 different stage (GM, day 0, 2, 4) of C2C12 myogenesis assays and found that 399 genes expression is characterized as downregulation pattern during myogenesis. Importantly, this down regulation gene set and upregulated genes by shRNA for Rp58 were highly overlapped. Keywords: time course, shRNA
