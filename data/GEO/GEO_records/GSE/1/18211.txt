TITLE
New candidate gene identification for controlling mammalian gonadal sex determination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian gonadal sex determination is dependent on proper expression of sex determining genes in fetal gonadal somatic support cells (i.e., pre-granulosa and pre-Sertoli cells in XX and XY gonads, resp.). We used a unique transgenic mouse strain combined with microarray profiling to identify all the differentially expressed transcripts  in XX and XY isolated somatic support cells during critical stages of gonadal development and differentiation.

DESIGN
XX and XY somatic support cells (SSC) were isolated by flow cytometry from embryonic day (E) 11.5 and E12.5 mouse gonads. Total RNA was isolated from  pools of isolated cells; 3 pools per sex and each timepoint.
