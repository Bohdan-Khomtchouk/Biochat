TITLE
Differential gene expression in murine neural stem cells (NS5) and neural stem cell-derived astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in NS5 murine neural stem cells was compared to that of astrocytes derived from NS5 cells via 3 days of treatment with foetal calf serum (FCS). Keywords: cell type comparison
