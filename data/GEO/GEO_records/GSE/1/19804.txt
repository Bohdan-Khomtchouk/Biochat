TITLE
Genome-wide screening of transcriptional modulation in non-smoking female lung cancer in Taiwan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, only 7% of female lung cancer patients in Taiwan have a history of cigarette smoking, extremely lower than those in Caucasian females.  This report is a comprehensive analysis of the molecular signature of non-smoking female lung cancer in Taiwan.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from paired tumor and normal tissues for gene expression analysis.
