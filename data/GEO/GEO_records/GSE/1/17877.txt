TITLE
Responses to inhibitors in an industrial strain of yeast and the adapted strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Furfural, phenol and acetic acid, generated during cellulosic material pretreatment, are the representative inhibitors to yeast used for ethanol production. The responses to these inhibitors in industrial yeast and the corresponding adapted strains were analyzed.
