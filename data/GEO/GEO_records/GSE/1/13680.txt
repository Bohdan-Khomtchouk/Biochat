TITLE
Expression Profiling to Identify Novel Desiccation Response Transcripts from Tortula ruralis gametophytes

ORGANISM
Syntrichia ruralis

SUMMARY
In this study we have tried to utilize the unique aspects of the T. ruralis response to desiccation and rehydration to design a strategy to identify rehydrins that are of low abundance and perhaps completely novel to the desiccated or rehydration transcriptomes. We have constructed two Subtractive Suppression Hybridization (SSH) libraries (Diatchenko et al., 1996) that are designed to enrich for differentially expressed low-abundance transcripts contained within gametophytic cells either in the slow-dried state (mRNP sequestrated rehydrin transcripts) or cells that have been rapidly dried, rehydrated and sampled at 2h of hydration (rehydrin and recovery transcripts) when the translational change in gene expression is at its peak (Oliver 1991). To achieve this aim we constructed SSH libraries using PolyA RNA isolated from the polysomal (mRNP) fractions from the slow-dried and 2h rehydrated rapid dried gametophytes selected against PolyA RNA from hydrated control gametophytes as the source for driver cDNA. Collections of cDNA clones from each library were sequenced and used to generate a small T. ruralis SSH cDNA microarray for expression profiling of both total RNA extracts for transcript accumulation assessments and polysomal RNA extracts for transcript sequestration and recruitment assessments.
