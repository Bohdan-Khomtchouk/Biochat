TITLE
HSP27 3A vs WT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human bronchial smooth muscle cells were infected with adenoviral constructs containing either the phosphorylation mutant form of HSP27 (HSP27-3A) or the wild type form (HSP27-WT) at 40 MOI for 4 days.  All sets were stimulated with a cytokine mixture containing 10 ng/ml IL-1beta, TNF-alfa, and gamma-IFN for 20 hours prior to harvest.  This series represents 4 separate preparations of cells and RNA, with each set being subjected to a dye flip and hybridized to 2 different slides. Keywords: parallel sample
