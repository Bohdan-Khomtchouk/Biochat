TITLE
Differential gene expression in GBS6 cells after EWS-POU5F1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our objective is to clarify the function of EWS-POU5F1 chimera. Specifially, GBS6 cells were established from an undifferentiated bone sarcoma carrying translocation t(6;22)(p21;q12). The translocation resulted in a gene fusion between EWS and POU5F1. Gene expression analysis of t(6;22) undifferentiated sarcoma cell line GBS6 transfected with POU5F1 specific siRNA to investigate the function of EWS-POU5F1.
