TITLE
Impact of sucrose retrieval upon ex vitro acclimatization

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Hybridization and study was conducted to measure the impact of short-term sugar deprivation, on an acclimatization time-scale, imposed to plantlet transferred from in vitro to ex vitro culture conditions. We thus submitted in vitro tomato plantlets to sugar deprivation for 24-h in order to better understands the impact of sucrose retrieval upon ex vitro acclimatization.
