TITLE
Human activated Treg cells and retrovirally engineered Th cells, transduced with GARP, FOXP3 or control GFP vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goals and objectives of this study: to identify genes of the Treg signature induced by consitutive expression of GARP or FOXP3 in antigen-specific Th cells with potential role for stabililization & maintenance of the regulatory program. Keywords: T-cell receptor stimulation, gene-regulation, comparative gene expression profiling, cell type comparison, human, regulatory T cells, FOXP3, GARP
