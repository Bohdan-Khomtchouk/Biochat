TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells by microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we profiled the change of gene expression by p53 knock-down on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cell line, KAT-18 cells using Applied Biosystem's Microarrays. When compared with the untreated control KAT-18 cells, 2,926 genes were found to have altered expression levels of 2-fold or more in cells treated with antisense p53 oligonucleotide. Microarray analysis revealed that p53 knock-down modified the expression of numerous apoptosis-related genes. Among those genes, 33 apoptosis pathway activators and 20 apoptosis pathway repressors were identified.
