TITLE
Genome-Wide Profiling of Astrocytic Gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic aberrations were determined by array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 131 diffuse astrocytic gliomas, including 87 primary glioblastomas (pGBIV), 13 secondary glioblastomas (sGBIV), 19 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAIII), and 12 diffuse astrocytomas (AII). Expression profiling was performed for 74 tumors (42 pGBIV, 11 sGBIV, 13 AAIII, 8 AII).

DESIGN
131 aCGH experiments. 87 EP experiments (x2 dye swap). DNA and RNA extracted from the same patients.
