SUMMARY
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a malignant disease of the hematopoietic stem cell, characterized by the expression of the Bcr-Abl oncogene by leukemic cells. In order to analyze the molecular pathways modulated by Bcr-Abl, we have previously generated an inducible model of Bcr-Abl expression in the murine Ba/F3 cell line based on the Tet-OFF system. In the present study, through a microarray approach applied to cells grown with (Bcr-Abl-expression OFF) or without (Bcr-Abl-expression ON) doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, we analyzed the gene expression variations upon Bcr-Abl expression. Keywords: repeat sample
