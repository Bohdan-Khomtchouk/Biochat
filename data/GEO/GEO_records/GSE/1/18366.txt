TITLE
Differential Gene Expression Profiles in CD34+ Myelodysplastic Syndrome Marrow cells to Disease Subtype and Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis with 40,000 cDNA gene chip arrays determined differential gene expression profiles (GEPs) in CD34+ marrow cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients compared to normal individuals.  Using focused bioinformatics analyses, we found 1175 genes significantly differentially expressed by MDS vs Normal, requiring a minimum of 39 genes to separately classify these patients. Major GEP differences were demonstrated between Normal and MDS patients and between several MDS subgroups: (1) those whose disease remained stable (sMDS) and those who subsequently transformed (tMDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); (2) between del(5q) and other MDS patients. A 6-gene ‘poor risk’ signature was defined which was associated with AML transformation and provided additive prognostic information for IPSS Intermediate-1 patients. Over-expression of genes generating  ribosomal proteins and for other signaling pathways was demonstrated in the tMDS patients. Comparison of del(5q) to the remaining MDS patients showed 1924 differentially expressed genes, with under-expression of 1014 genes, 11 of which were within the 5q31-32 Commonly Deleted Region. These data demonstrated (1) GEPs distinguishing MDS patients from normal and between those with differing clinical outcomes (tMDS vs sMDS) and cytogenetics [eg, del(5q)] ; and (2) molecular criteria refining prognostic categorization and associated biologic processes in MDS.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles from CD34+ cells of 35 MDS subjects and 6 Normals were compared.
