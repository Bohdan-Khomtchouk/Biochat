TITLE
The Physcomitrella Degradome

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of the 5' ends of uncapped, polyA-enriched mRNA from the moss Physcomitrella patens was performed (e.g. " degradome sequencing " ).  This GEO record contains all genome-matched and/or transcriptome-matched processed 24nt tags, representing the 5' ends of uncapped messages.  These data were used to 1) discover microRNA targets and 2) to examine patterns of MIRNA hairpin cleavage.

DESIGN
A sample of wild-type polyA+ RNA from P. patens protonemata was used to construct a degradome library, which was subsequently sequenced using an ABI SOLiD instrument.  Computational processing to trim 5' and 3' adapter sequences left 24nt tags, the 5' ends of which represented the 5' ends of uncapped mRNAs.
