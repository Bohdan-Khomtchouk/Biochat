TITLE
Novel microRNA-target RNA pairs revealed by Parallel analysis of RNA ends

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important regulatory molecules in most eukaryotes and the identification of their mRNA targets is essential for their functional analysis. From inflorescence tissue of Arabidopsis, > 28,000,000 signatures were sequenced from 5’ ends of polyadenylated products of mRNA decay. Within the set of ~27,000 transcripts included in the 3,500,000 non-redundant signatures, several previously predicted but non-validated miRNA targets were found. Like validated targets, most showed a single abundant signature at the miRNA cleavage site, particularly in libraries from a mutant deficient in the 5’ to 3’ exonuclease AtXRN4. Among the most unexpected miRNA targets discovered were miRNA precursor transcripts that are self-targeted by their own mature miRNA. Although the miRNAs of Arabidopsis have been extensively investigated, working in reverse from the cleaved targets, additional novel miRNAs were identified and validated. This deep and versatile approach will impact the study of other aspects of RNA processing beyond miRNA-target RNA pair analyses.
