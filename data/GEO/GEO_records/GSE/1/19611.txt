SUMMARY
Background. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nt) non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression at the translational level. Deregulation of miRNA expression has been discovered in a wide variety of tumours and it is now clear that they contribute to cancer development and progression. This prompted the development of miRNA-chips for cancer diagnosis or prognosis, opening a new door to understand carcinogenesis. Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Therefore, there is a strong need for a non-invasive, fast and efficient method to diagnose the disease. We investigated miRNA expression profiles in cervical cancer using a microarray platform developed in house containing probes for mature miRNAs. Results. We have evaluated miRNA expression profiles of a heterogeneous set of cervical tissues from 25 different patients. This set included 19 normal cervical tissues, 4 squamous cell carcinoma, 5 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 9 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) samples. We observed high variability in miRNA expression especially among normal cervical samples, which prevented us from obtaining a unique miRNA expression signature for this tumour type. However, miRNAs deregulation in malignant and pre-malignant cervical tissues was detected after tackling the high variability observed. We were also able to identify putative targets of relevant candidate miRNAs.  Conclusions. Our results show that miRNA deregulation may play an important role in the malignant transformation of cervical squamous cells. In addition, deregulated miRNAs highlight new candidate targets allowing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of this tumour type.
