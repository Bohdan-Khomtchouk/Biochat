TITLE
Identifying mRNA targets of microRNA in clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A bioinformatic approach to identify targets of microRNA in cancer. Keywords: Patient sample study

DESIGN
Samples GSM413237-GSM413270: Total RNA from 17 RCC tumors and 17 corresponding non-tumor samples was hybridized against a common reference RNA (Perou CM, Sorlie T, Eisen MB, et al. Molecular portraits of human breast tumours. Nature 2000;406:747-752) for gene expression analysis. Samples GSM413271-GSM413304: MicroRNA from 17 RCC tumors and 17 corresponding non-tumor samples were hybridized on a single channel platform for miRNA expression analysis.
