TITLE
Comparison of fire ant adult workers with different Gp-9 (BB and Bb) genotypes and from monogyne and polygyne colonies.

ORGANISM
Solenopsis invicta

SUMMARY
In fire ants, a complex colony level phenotype, colony queen number, is completely associated with a single Mendelian factor marked by the gene Gp-9. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether variation in the genomic region marked by Gp-9 is associated with differences in patterns of expression of genes other than Gp-9 in workers. The second aim was to study how the social environment (i.e., presence or absence of nestmate workers with the b allele) can alter individual gene expression patterns. Keywords: Genotype comparison and social form comparison
