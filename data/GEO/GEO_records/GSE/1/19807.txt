TITLE
miRNA profiling by Illumina sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Urocitellus parryii

SUMMARY
miRNAs are 19-25 nucleotides long small RNAs now well-known for their regulatory roles in the development and diseases through post-transcriptional and translational controls in a wide range of species. Mammalian hibernation is a physiological process involving dramatic metabolic suppression and cellular reorganization, during which miRNAs may play an important role. We systematically analyzed the miRNAs in the liver of an extreme hibernating species, arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii), during two stages of hibernation compared to non-hibernating animals by massively parallel Illumina sequencing technology. We identified more than 200 ground squirrel miRNAs including novel miRNAs specific to ground squirrel and a fast-evolving miRNA cluster that also showed significant differential expression during hibernation. Integrating with Agilent miRNA microarray and Real-time PCR results, we identified that mir-211, mir-378, mir-184, mir-200a, and mir-320 were significantly under-expressed during hibernation, whereas mir-144, mir-486, mir-451, mir-142-5p, and mir-1 were over-expressed. Analyses of the their target genes suggested that these miRNAs could play an important role to suppress tumor progression and cell growth during hibernation.

DESIGN
Investigation of microRNA changes in arctic ground squirrel livers during Early Arousal(EA), Late Topor(LT), and Post-Reproduction(PR) stages.
