TITLE
Whole blood gene expression data from PFAPA syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PFAPA, the syndrome of periodic fever associated with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and/or cervical adenitis, is the most common periodic fever disease in children. Cases are mostly sporadic; the etiopathogenesis is unknown. In order to shed more insights into pathogenesis, we performed microarray expression analysis on samples from patients with PFAPA during and between flares, healthy controls and patients with hereditary autoinflammatory diseases during flares.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from whole peripheral blood from six patients with PFAPA syndrome during flares and asymptomatic intervals, six healthy controls and six patients with hereditary autoinflammatory diseases (2 familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), 1 TNF-receptor-asociated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS) and 3 cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS)).
