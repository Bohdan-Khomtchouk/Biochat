TITLE
Expression data for a study on cross-species hybridization on single-species microarrays

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Gene expression was examined in testis and brain tissue between two species (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus borealis) and their hybrid. Genomic DNA hybridizations of the microarray target and non-target species were used to select probes that are unbiased between species.
