Frequent in-frame somatic deletions activate gp130 in inflammatory hepatocellular tumours

SUMMARY
Inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas (IHCA) are benign liver tumours defined by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and by the elevated expression of inflammatory proteins in tumour hepatocytes1,2. Here we show a striking activation of the IL6 signalling pathway in this tumour type, and sequencing candidate genes pinpointed this response to somatic gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene that encodes the signalling co-receptor gp130. Indeed, ~70% of IHCA harbour small in-frame deletions that target the binding site of gp130 for IL6, and expression of the most frequent gp130 mutant, Delta-STVY190, in hepatocellular cells activates STAT3 in absence of ligand. Further, analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas revealed rare gp130 alterations always accompanied by ÃŸ-catenin-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative effect of these signalling pathways in the malignant conversion of hepatocytes. The recurrent gain-of-function gp130 mutations in these human hepatocellular adenomas explains their inflammatory phenotype, and suggest that similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumours with STAT3 activation.
