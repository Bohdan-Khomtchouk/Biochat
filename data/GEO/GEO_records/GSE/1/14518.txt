TITLE
Endometrial profile of low-dose estradiol and tamoxifen combination therapy

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Combination therapy with estrogen and a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is a promising approach to safely alleviate important side effects related to estrogen deficiency in women at high risk for breast cancer.  Data related to endometrial safety of estrogen+SERM co-therapies are limited, however.  The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial profile of low-dose E2 and Tam alone and in combination.
