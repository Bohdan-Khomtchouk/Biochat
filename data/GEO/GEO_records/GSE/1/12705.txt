TITLE
Differential gene expression during porcine conceptus trophoblastic elongation and attachment to the uterine epithelium

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of the present investigation was to utilize the GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Array from Affymetrix possessing 20, 201 unique probe sets to identify differentially expressed genes during rapid trophoblastic elongation and attachment to the uterine surface in the pig.  Identification and characterization of conceptus gene expression patterns during rapid trophoblastic elongation and attachment in the pig will provide a better understanding of the events required for successful implantation and embryonic survival.
