TITLE
Arginine-dependent gene regulation in Streptococcus gordonii ArgR regulator knockout

ORGANISM
Streptococcus gordonii

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that responses of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to arginine are co-ordinated by three paralogous regulators: ArgR, ArgR and AhrC. This set of experiments was designed to assess the effects of the ArgR gene regulator on global gene expression in Streptococcus gordonii under high arginine or following a shift to no arginine.
