TITLE
Molecular Remodeling of Ion Channels in Human Atrial and Ventricular Myocytes Associated with Ischemic Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) leads to congestive heart failure and can cause sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia. Existing molecular knowledge base of ICM is rudimentary because of lack of specific attribution to cell type and function. This study was designed to investigate cell-specific molecular remodeling of ion channels, exchangers and pumps, which are signaling molecules (SM) involved in electrical, signaling and mechanical functions of the heart. Atrial and ventricular myocytes were isolated by laser-capture microdissection from left atrium and ventricle of healthy and ICM human hearts. SM and their splice variants altered by ICM in cardiomyocytes were identified by splice microarray and validated by RT-PCR. Molecular profiling of ICM-related changes showed that SM in atrial and ventricular myocytes remodel following their unique programs. ICM affected 63 genes in ventricular myocytes and 12 genes in atrial myocytes. Only few of the identified genes were previously linked to human cardiac disfunctions.

DESIGN
In our experiments we used 3 healthy hearts rejected from transplantation procedure and explanted ICM hearts from three male patients. Tissue samples were dissected from left ventricle and left atrial appendages. Atrial and ventricular myocytes were laser-capture  microdissected from serial 7-8-Âµm thick cryostat sections. Individual cellular total RNA samples were analyzed on custom-built Human Ion Channel Splice Arrays slides (ExonHit) manufactured on the Ion Channel Splice Array sv1.1 platform representing 287 human SM, including 248 alternatively spliced ones in total 1655 splicing events and supplemented with capabilities to recognize connexins and ryanodine receptors.
