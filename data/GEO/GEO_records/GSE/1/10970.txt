TITLE
Efficient Array-based Identification of Novel Cardiac Genes through Differentiation of Mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac disease accounts for the largest proportion of adult mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. However, progress toward improved clinical treatments is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the genetic programs controlling early cardiogenesis. To better understand this process, we set out to identify genes whose expression is enriched within early cardiac fated populations, obtaining the transcriptional signatures of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiating along a cardiac path. We compared the RNA profiles of cardiac precursors cells (CPCs) with time-matched non-CPCs and undifferentiated mESCs, using a transgenic mESC line harboring an Nkx2-5 cardiac-specific regulatory sequence driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) to facilitate selection of CPCs. Approximately 24% (43/176) of the transcripts enriched in the CPC population have known roles in cardiac function or development. Importantly, we evaluated the biological relevance of a subset 31/133 (23%) of the remaining candidate genes by in situ hybridization and report that all were expressed in key cardiac structures during cardiogenesis (embryonic day, E7.5 - 9.5), many of which were previously uncharacterized. These data demonstrate the power of mESC differentiation to model specific developmental processes and provide a valuable resource that may be mined to further elucidate the genetic programs underlying cardiogenesis. Keywords: time course, differentiated cardiac cell fate
