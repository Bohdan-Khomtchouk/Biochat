TITLE
Screening bone marrow derived murine mesenchymal stem cells for tumourigenicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study early events in osteosarcoma genesis murine bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) were studied which generated osteosarcoma-like tumours upon injection into nude mice. The process of transformation was studied in a step-wise manner by culturing the MSCs in vitro for 28 passages. Subsequently the transformed passage 28 MSCs were compared to their normal passage 12 originator cells in a number of experiments to identify underlying events prior to malignant transformation. In addition both low and high passage MSCs were shown to still have the phenotypical and functional characteristics of normal MSCs.
