TITLE
Spatially uniform establishment of chromatin accessibility in the early Drosophila embryo

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
As the Drosophila embryo transitions from the use of maternal RNAs to zygotic transcription, domains of “open” chromatin, with relatively low nucleosome density and specific histone marks, are established at promoters and enhancers involved in patterned embryonic transcription. However it remains unclear whether open chromatin is a product of activity - transcription at promoters and patterning transcription factor binding at enhancers - or whether it is established by independent mechanisms. Recent work has implicated the ubiquitously expressed maternal factor Zelda in this process. To assess the relative contribution of activity in the establishment of open chromatin , we have probed chromatin accessibility across the anterior-posterior axis of early Drosophila melanogaster embryos by applying a transposon based assay for chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) to anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected, cellular blastoderm embryos. We find that genome-wide chromatin accessibility is remarkably similar between the two halves. Promoters and enhancers that are active in exclusively one half of the embryo have open chromatin in the other half, demonstrating that chromatin accessibility is not a direct result of activity. However there is a small skew at enhancers that drive transcription exclusively in either the anterior or posterior half of the embryo, with greater accessibility in the region of activity. Taken together these data support a model in which regions of chromatin accessibility are defined and established by ubiquitous factors, and fine tuned subsequently by activity.

DESIGN
We perfomed ATAC-seq on 20 anterior and 20 posterior stage 5 Drosophila melanogaster (OregonR) embryos that were frozen and sliced in half with a razor blade.
