TITLE
mutant vs wildtype-Embryonic patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt05-04_drn - mutant vs wildtype - DRN targets  - Ovules containing heart-stage/torpedo-stage embryos were dissected from siliques and imidiately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted and sent to Evry for comparison between mutant and wildtype transcriptome. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
