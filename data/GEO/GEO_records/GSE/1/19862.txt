TITLE
Prediction of response to bevacizumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The patients who underwent surgery for primary lesions were examined. All patients had metastatic or recurrent CRC and received bevacizumab therapy as first line or second line treatment. Responders and nonresponders were determined based on RECIST and confirmed by CT or MRI. Gene-expression profiles of primary CRC were determined using Human Genome GeneChip arrays U133.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer were studied. To identify molecular signatures to predict response to bevacizumab, gene expression profiles were compared between Reponder and Non-responder.
