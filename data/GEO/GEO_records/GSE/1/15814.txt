TITLE
High resolution analysis of epigenetic changes associated with X inactivation, ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the epigenetic profiling of the X chromosome during X inactivation. It includes H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq profiles of male (E14) and female (LF2 and XT67E1) mouse ES cells, together with their differentiated derivatives (either 4d atRA or 10d EB). It also includes ChIP-chip profiles around the Xic on chromosome X of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K36me3, Pol II, TBP, H3-Core as well as expression, using male (E14) and female (LF2) mouse ES cells, together with their differentiated derivatives (either 4d atRA or 10d EB).

DESIGN
Examination of two different histone modifications in 3 cell lines under 3 conditions using ChIP-Seq. Examination of five different histone modifications two transcription factors and gene expression under three conditions in 2 cell lines using ChIP-chip.
