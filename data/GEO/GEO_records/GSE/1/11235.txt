Sex of Blood

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood samples were taken at 1:00 pm +/- 1 h (Potassium-EDTA-monovettes, Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) to control for circadian influences on gene expression. Blood was taken from normal male controls, normal female controls as well as different patients with disorders of sex development leading to a dissection of sex chromosomes and external genital phenotype. All samples were analyzed by a blood cell counter (Beckmann-Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and white blood cell counts did not differ between the normal males and the normal females (by t-test). PBMCs were isolated from whole blood using PBS (pH 7.2) and Ficoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) gradient centrifugation. A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Disease State: diagnosis Genotype: sex genotype Age: age at blood sample collection (yrs;mo) Phenotype: external genitalia (Prader classification) Keywords: reference_design
