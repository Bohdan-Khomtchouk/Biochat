TITLE
Mechanism of biphasic effects of alcohol on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
the molecular mechanisms for the biphasic effect of alcohol are not fully understood. The goal of the study is to identify genes that are differentially expressed following alcohol exposure of 50mM and 100mM ethanol for 24 hours.
