TITLE
ARGONAUTE-small RNA Interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana Identified by High-Throughput Sequencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify small RNA-ARGONAUTE interactions in Arabidopsis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays followed by high-throughput sequencing were done to identify small RNA associated with HA-AGO2 and HA-AGO7. Keywords: small RNA - ARGONAUTE interactions
