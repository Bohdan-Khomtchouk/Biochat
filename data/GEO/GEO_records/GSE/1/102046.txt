TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of in vitro-generated human monocyte-derived cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptomes of human dendritic cells and macrophages derived from monocytes using MCSF + IL-4 + TNFa, or IL-34 + IL-4 + TNFa, or dendritic cells derived from monocytes using GMCSF + IL-4.

DESIGN
We used as precursor cells the monocytes purified from the blood of 6 different donors. The data set contains therefore 6 biological replicates for each population of monocyte-derived cells analyzed.
