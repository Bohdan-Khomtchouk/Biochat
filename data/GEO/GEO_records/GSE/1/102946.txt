TITLE
Cannabinoid receptor activation induces CREB/GADD34-dependent dephosphorylation of eIF2a and upregulation of eIF2B1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A reduction in the phosphorylated state of eIF2a enhances general protein synthesis and long-term memory formation. Recent evidence suggests that the downstream molecular effects of drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine and nicotine) converge on the dephosphorylation of eIF2a. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this drug-induced dephosphorylation are still unclear. In addition, psychoactive cannabinoid drugs have not yet been examined with regard to eIF-related molecules. Here, using a neuronal-like model, we find that a synthetic cannabinoid (WIN) leads to the dephosphorylation of eIF2a by upregulating the PP1-recruiter, GADD34 (PPP1R15A). This induction is associated with ERK/CREB/CBP-signaling and histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. We also find that WIN upregulates an eIF2-activator subunit (eIF2B1) and potentiates gene expression in response to a dopamine receptor D1 agonist. This molecular understanding of cannabinoid receptor activation provides the groundwork for future preclinical cross-sensitization studies.

DESIGN
RNAseq from PC12 cell line with a 6 hour DMSO or WIN treatment.
