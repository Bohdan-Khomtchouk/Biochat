SUMMARY
rs07-02_npc48 - analysis of npc48 overexpressing plants - Identification of potential targets of the non-protein codding RNA npc48. - We have lines overexpressing npc48 that shhowed a leaf morphological phenotype (serrated leaves). The proportion of lines havin gthe phenotype is around 20% of total transformants. We wanted to compare the transcriiptome of npc48-overexpressing lines with and without phenotype together with a transformation control for an additional control. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic)
