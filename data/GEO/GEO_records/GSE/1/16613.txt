TITLE
Comparison between stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, testis and epididymis in mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An experiment was performed in order to compare directly profiles of stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, testis and epidydimis, in order to rule out a possible contamination of the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue (SVF) by adjacent tissues (i.e. epididymis and testis). This led to the identification of a list of 2358 SVF-specific probes, which was subsequently used for further investigations.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap pairs, comparing 3 distinct samples of total RNA prepared from: (1) stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, (2) testis and (3) epidydimis.
