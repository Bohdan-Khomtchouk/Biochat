TITLE
Transcript profiling of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in BALF

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 5b str. L20

SUMMARY
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of contagious pleuropneumonia, an economically important disease of commercially reared swine throughout the world.  To cause this disease, A. pleuropneumoniae must rapidly overcome porcine pulmonary innate immune defenses.  Since bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) contains many of the innate immune components found in the lung, we examined the gene expression of a virulent serovar 1 strain of A. pleuropneumoniae after exposure to concentrated BALF.  This experiment was also carried out with a malT mutant of the same strain.
