TITLE
Effect of R568 on podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Calcimimetics such as R568 are renoprotective and the underlying mechanism is not yet fully clarified. We consider the importance of podocytes in mediating the beneficial effect of calcimimetics on kidney. Affymetrix array type Moe430_2 was used to study the effect of R-568. Analysis of differential gene expression indicates that R-568 acts antioxidative, stabilizes cytoskeleton, enhances cell cycle control and suppresses apoptosis in podocytes. This suggests that calcimimetics limit podocyte damage by antiapoptotic and cytoskeleton stabilizing effects and may thus constitute a new pharmacological approach in the prevention and treatment of glomerular disease.

DESIGN
Podocytes treated with and without R568 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
