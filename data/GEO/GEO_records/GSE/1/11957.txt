TITLE
Genetic Structure of Duplicated Sequences Revealed by Genotyping Single Sperm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three different experimental approaches were evaluated for discrimination of genomic variance in and between duplicated sequences using 48 markers in duplicon regions and 17 SNPs in unique sequences previously characterized in another study. We found only the method high-throughput single sperm typing could conclusively resolve the alleles of all markers. Resulting data from single sperm analysis were also used to examine the genetic structure of duplicon markers in the human population. Single sperm typing can be a rapid, efficient and accurate method for initial screening and assessment of genetic variation and for detailed genetic analysis of duplicon markers.
