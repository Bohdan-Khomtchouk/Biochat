TITLE
DNA methylation comparison of ntTS, TS and ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Placental abnormalities occur frequently in cloned animals. To investigate DNA methylation profile of trophoblast cell lineage of somatic cell nuclear transferred (NT) embryos, we established TS cells from blastocysts produced by NT at the blastocyst stage.

DESIGN
Three independent TS cell lines derived from NT embryos rom BDF1 background were used in this study. Two control lines, derived from native blastocysts of BDF1 background, were also used.
