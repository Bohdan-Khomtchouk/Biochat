TITLE
NLR Nod1 signaling promotes survival of BCR-engaged mature B cells through upregulated Nod1 as a positive outcome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BCR ligand-engaged B cells upregulate Nod1 during development. Most mature B cells have up-regulated Nod1 and are sensitive to Nod1 signaling, which increases survival upon exposure to microbial products, as a positive outcome of BCR-engaged mature B cells.

DESIGN
Dye-swap pair  for each sample were done on 2 individual arrays.
