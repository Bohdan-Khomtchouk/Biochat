TITLE
0.6% Methamphetamine feeding experiments

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Methamphetamine can trigger dopamine releasing in human brain, now used as abuse drug. Some studies have shown that specific genes and proteins responded to, methamphetamine, but little is known about the overall “omic” response of organisms to this illicit substance.   Here we demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster has the potential to give us significant insights into evolutionarily conserved responses to methamphetamine.  We performed metabolome, proteome, and transciptome profiling with Drosophila treated with methamphetamine.  The proteomic profiling revealed responses associated with known physiological problems that occur with methamphetamine usage in mammals.  The metabolomic result showed that the metabolite trehalose was decreased significantly after methamphetamine exposure, suggesting an oxidative stress response to this drug.  Many of the differential transcribed genes, including detoxification enzymes, had the potential transcription factor-binding motif YY1 associated with their upstream regulatory regions.  YY1 is known to be responsive to amphetamines in mammals.

DESIGN
For each sample, 20 virgin male flies were used to extract the mRNA. Three replicates were produced for each treatments. Two treatments were produced (control VS 0.6% 24 h meth-fed).
