TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of North Atlantic Right Whale Kidney Fibroblast Cell line exposed to cadmium

ORGANISM
Tursiops truncatus

SUMMARY
An 8X15k oligonucleotide microarray was developed consisting of 2334 E. glacialis probes and 2166 Tursiops truncatus probes and used to measure the transcriptome level effects of right whale kidney fibroblast cells exposed to cadmium. Cells were exposed to three concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) for three exposure times. Cells exposed to 10-6M CdCl2 for 4 hours and 24 hours showed upregulated genes involved in protection from metal toxicity, oxidative stress, protein renaturation, apoptosis inhibition, and several regulators of cellular processes. Downregulated genes represented a suite of functions including cell proliferation, transcription regulation, actin polymerization, and stress fiber synthesis. The collection of differentially expressed genes in this study support proposed mechanisms of cadmium-induced apoptosis such as mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, reactive oxygen species (ROS) influx, and cell cycle arrest. The results confirm the right whale microarray as a reproducible tool in measuring differentiated gene expression and should be a valuable asset for transcriptome analysis of other baleen whales and potential health assessment protocols.
