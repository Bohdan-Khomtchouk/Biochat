TITLE
Sessile serrated adenomas and conventional adenomas of the colon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sessile serrated adenomas are now recognized as precursor lesions of a substantial subset of colorectal cancers arising via a so-called “serrated pathway”. However, their biological markers remain to be defined. The aim of our study was to identify differentially expressed genes in sessile serrated adenomas, hyperplastic polyps and tubular adenomas. Gene expression analysis demonstrated molecular differences between polyp types. Further studies using QRT-PCR on Cathepsin E demonstrated a significantly (p < 0.05) higher expression in sessile serrated adenomas as compared to both other polyp types. Trefoil Factor 1, showed the same trend of expression for sessile serrated adenomas as compared to hyperplastic polyps, and was significantly higher in both polyps compared to tubular adenomas. Immunohistochemistry for both proteins demonstrated strong cytoplasmic staining of abnormal crypts in all sessile serrated adenomas while staining in tubular adenomas and hyperplastic polyps was weak and focal. BRAF and KRAS mutation analysis were employed to further validate polyp discrimination. The findings demonstrated the positive association of the BRAF mutation, V600E, with sessile serrated adenomas and KRAS mutations with tubular adenomas (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates CTSE and TFF1 over-expression in sessile serrated adenomas compared to both hyperplastic polyps and tubular adenomas.
