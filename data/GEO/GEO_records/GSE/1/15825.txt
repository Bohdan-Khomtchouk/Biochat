TITLE
An mRNA/3' UTR-directed primary piRNA pathway in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are ~24-30 nucleotide regulatory RNAs that are abundantly expressed in gonads. The most well-understood piRNAs mediate post-transcriptional defense against transposable elements (TEs), and derive from sense or antisense strands as a consequence of " ping-pong " amplification of complementary sequences of active TEs and piRNA master control transcripts. Another class of piRNAs, such as those expressed in pachytene testis, derive from large intergenic clusters that are strictly single-stranded. Here, we report a third substrate that generates abundant primary piRNAs. In somatic follicle cells of Drosophila ovaries, we cloned > 1 million piRNAs from thousands of messenger RNAs, and these were quite preferentially derived from 3' untranslated regions.  This segregation implies a competition between the translation machinery and primary piRNA biogenesis machinery for mRNA access.

DESIGN
3 replicates.
