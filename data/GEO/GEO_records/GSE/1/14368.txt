TITLE
The anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) protects against the development of islet autoimmunity.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through gene expression profiling in cultured lymphocytes and PBMCs from a large set of T1D patients and controls, we demonstrate that IL-1ra may protect against the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D through down-regulating a large number of inflammatory genes and pathways. Keywords: autoimmunity; IL-1Ra;Type 1 diabetes (T1D)
