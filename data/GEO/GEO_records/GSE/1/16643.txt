TITLE
Effect of glucocorticoid chemical structure and receptor potency on human trabecular meshwork cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids with different chemical structures but similar glucocorticoid receptor potency regulate subsets of common and unique genes in human trabecular meshwork cells. Gene expression changes of human trabecular meshwork cells, TM 86 and TM 93, due to treatment with dexamethasone (Dex), fluocinolone acetonide (FA), and triamcinolone acetonide (TA).

DESIGN
Agilent Human Whole Genome Expression oligonucleotide microarray. Changes of genome-wide mRNA transcription levels were determined by treating cultured TM 86 and TM 93 cells with 1 uM of either Dex, FA, and TA for 24 hours versus DMSO vehicle controls. This was followed by total RNA extraction, labeling of RNA with Cy3, and hybridization of Cy3-labeled cRNA to the Agilent Human Whole Genome microarray for 17 hours. The microarray experiment was repeated three times.
