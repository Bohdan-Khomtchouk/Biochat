TITLE
Interplay between c-Jun and TAp73α/β contributes to the apoptosis-survival balance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The p53-family member p73 functions in various cellular signaling pathways and can have tumor suppressor properties. Several isoforms of p73 exist that differ considerably in their function. Whereas the functions of the N-terminal isoforms (TA and ΔNp73) and their opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic roles became evident, the functional differences of the distinct C-terminal spliceforms of TAp73 have remained unclear. Here, we characterized the genomic binding sites for TAp73α and TAp73β and identified a specific p73 consensus binding-motif. Furthermore, an AP1 motif is strongly enriched close to binding sites for TAp73α. These AP1 motif-containing target genes are selectively upregulated by TAp73α, while their mRNA expression is repressed upon TAp73β induction. Recruitment of c-Jun to the respective AP1 sites was impaired upon TAp73β expression in part due to downregulation of c-Jun. We show that several of these AP1-site containing TAp73α-induced genes reduce on apoptosis-induction suggesting an underlying molecular mechanism for the observed functional differences between TAp73α and TAp73β.
