Comparison of TCF hyper-activated and control Huh7 cells - microarray data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in many differentiation events during embryonic development and can lead to tumor formation after aberrant activation of its components. Β-catenin, a cytoplasmic component, plays a major role in the transduction of the canonical wnt/ β-catenin signaling. The aim of this study was to identify novel genes that are regulated by active β-catenin/TCF signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma. We selected and expanded isogenic clones from hepatocellular carcinoma-derived Huh7 cells with high and low β-catenin/TCF activities. We showed that, high TCF activity Huh7 cells lead to bigger and more aggressive tumors when xenografted into nude mice. We used SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression), genome-wide microarray and in silico promoter analysis in parallel, to compare gene expression between low (basal) and high (transfected) β-catenin/TCF activity clones, those had been xenografted into nude mice. We compared and contrasted SAGE and genome-wide microarray data, in parallel. Finally; after combined analysis, we identified BRI3 and HSF2 as novel targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.
