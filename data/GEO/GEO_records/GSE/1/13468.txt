TITLE
Gene expression change in natural allotetraploid, A.suecica

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis is a suitable system for testing the hypothesis that duplicate genes accelerate evolution of expression diversity among species diverged from shared whole genome duplications (WGDs) and recurrent events of WGD. In Arabidopsis, at least 9 species split after WGD of the common ancestor and new allotetraploids were formed in nature and can be resynthesized between closely related species. Using genomic and gene expression microarrays, we detected WGD duplicate and single-copy genes preserved in A.thaliana and A.arenosa in addition to change of gene expression levels among those species. We found that even conserved duplicate genes show higher levels of expression divergence between two closely related species than single-copy genes. The proportion of the progenitorsâ€™ duplicate genes that were nonadditively expressed in the resynthesized and natural allotetraploids was significantly higher than that of single-copy genes. This results show that WGD duplicate genes provide expression variegation in response to recurring polyploidy as well as among species diverged from common WGD. Duplicate genes related to external stresses tended to be differentially expressed in allopolyploids and among their progenitors. Moreover, multiple-copy duplicate genes are likely to change expression between species and in the resynthesized and natural allotetraploids. Compared to single-copy genes, duplicate genes are less likely to be methylated in the promoter regions, facilitating transcriptional regulation by binding transcription factors and/or cis-and trans- acting proteins. Our results suggest that highly retained duplicate genes are important source for developing species specific expression level and novel expression regulation to adapt to environmental changes including subsequent polyploidy.
