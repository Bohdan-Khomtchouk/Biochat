TITLE
Gene expression profiles in rat lung after inhalation exposure to C60 fullerene or ultrafine NiO particles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the rat lung after whole-body inhalation exposure to C60 fullerene and ultrafine nickel oxide (Uf-NiO) particles as a positive control were employed to gain insights into these molecular events.
