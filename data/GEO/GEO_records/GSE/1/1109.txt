SUMMARY
p53 can induce apoptosis through multiple mechanisms including transactivation, transrepression or protein interactions but the determinism of the choice between them is poorly understood. In order to know the role of caspases in this choice, effect of caspase inhibition by ZVAD on p53 target genes transcription is tested by DNA chip analysis. Keywords: repeat sample
