TITLE
Comparison of bovine undifferentiated MSCs, chondrogenic MSCs and chondrocytes in 3D culture

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine chondrocyte-seeded and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-seeded agarose were cultured for 28 days in chemically defined media containing 10 ng/mL TGF-beta3.  Chondrogenic differentiated MSCs were compared to chondrocytes at this timepoint and to undifferentiated MSCs harvested at day 0.

DESIGN
Donor-matched sets of chondrocytes and MSCs were used, with three donors total.
