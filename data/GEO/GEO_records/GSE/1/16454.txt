TITLE
Gene expression data from small intestines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rb and E2F are thought to play antagonistic roles in celll proliferation.  However, this model is based mostly from in vitro cell culture systems.  We used small intestines to test this model in vivo. We found that deletion of E2f1-3 in the small intestine of mice suppressed the ectopic expression of E2F targets and cell proliferation caused by Rb-deficiency.  Surprisingly, E2f1-3 deletion failed to arrest the proliferation of intestinal cells containing an intact Rb gene, and instead led to E2F target derepression and apoptosis.

DESIGN
Total RNA of crypts and villi from wild-type, Rb-/-, E2f1-/-, E2f2-/-, E2f3-/-, E2f1-/-, E2f2-/-, and E2f3-/- small intestines.  Small intestines were harvested 7 days after mice were injected intraperitoneally with beta-napthoflavone.
