TITLE
Whole genome mapping of p73 binding sites in ME180 human cervical carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-resolution tiling arrays covering the human genome, we render a genome-wide map of p73 DNA binding sites in ME180 human cervical carcinoma cells.

DESIGN
Crosslinked chromatin from ME180 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-p73 monoclonal antibody (AKp73).
