TITLE
Genome-wide inter-primate comparison of gene expression profiles in multiple tissues

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Regulatory changes have long been hypothesized to play an important role in primate evolution. To identify adaptive regulatory changes in humans, we performed a genome-wide survey for genes whose regulation evolves under natural selection. To do so, we used a novel multi-species microarray to measure gene expression levels in livers, kidneys, and hearts from six humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques.
