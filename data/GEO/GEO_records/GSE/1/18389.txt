TITLE
Gene expression in the Atlantic salmon adipose-derived stromal-vascular fraction during differentiation into adipocytes

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Changes of gene expression in primary cell cultures of salmon adipose-derived stromal-vascular fraction were studied at six time-points that covered the key differentiation events: confluence, clonal expansion, determination and establishment of the mature adipocyte phenotype.
