TITLE
LongSAGE transcriptome comparison on Botrytis cinerea conidia germination with and without resveratrol treatment

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Two long serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE) libraries of germinating conidia of Botrytis cinerea were generated with and without resveratrol treatments for unraveling the antifungal mechanisms of this phytoalexin by global transcriptome analysis – 82,786 total tags and a minimum of 15,665 unitags were obtained respectively. By tag-to-gene mapping, about 55% of the total unitags were matched to known genes. There were 109 unitags that showed significant differences in the two LongSAGE libraries, corresponding to 43 up- and 44 down-regulated genes, and 22 unmatched unitags as new gene candidates. These results showed that resveratrol inhibited expression of genes related to the glycolysis-Krebs cycle and mitochondrial electron transport chains at multiple sites in conidia germination, with induction of modified Entner–Doudoroff pathway as metabolic compensation. The chaperone-mediated protein folding and ubiquitin proteolysis systems were inhibited, while detoxification of resveratrol via ABC transporters was activated in this fungal pathogen.
