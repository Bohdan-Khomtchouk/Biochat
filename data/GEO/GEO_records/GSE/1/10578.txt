SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used ChIP-chip to identify the determinants of AML1/ETO binding on a contiguous DNA region (chromosome 19). AML1/ETO binding regions are characterized by a specific sequence signature that includes the presence of the consensus binding sites for the AML1 and HEB transcription factors. We therefore assessed the binding patterns of AML1 and HEB on chromosome 19. A specific chromatin modification (tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 = 3MetK4) was also studied in U937 cells expressing AML1/ETO in order to correlate the identified binding profiles with active transcription sites.
