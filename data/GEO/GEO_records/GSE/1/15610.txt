TITLE
Knockout of the selenocysteine tRNA (Trsp) gene in mouse macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of gene expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from trsp knockout mice  (Trspfl/fl-LysM-Cre+/-) and Control (Trspfl/fl-LysM-Cre-/-) mice. Selenium, a micronutrient whose deficiency in the diet causes immune dysfunction and inflammatory disorders, exerts its physiological effects partly in the form of selenium-containing proteins (selenoproteins). Incorporation of selenium into the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), and subsequently into selenoproteins, is mediated by Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. To identify macrophage-specific selenoprotein function, we generated mice with the Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec gene specifically deleted in myeloid cells. These mutant mice were devoid of the selenoproteome in macrophages, yet exhibited largely normal inflammatory responses. However, selenoprotein deficiency led to aberrant expression of extracellular matrix-related genes, and diminished migration of macrophages in a protein gel matrix. Therefore, selenium status may affect immune defense and tissue homeostasis through its effect on selenoprotein expression and the trafficking of tissue macrophages.

DESIGN
We have generated mice in which we have selectively removed the selenocysteine tRNA gene (trsp) in macrophages under the control of LysM-Cre promoter. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA samples taken from bone marrow-derived macrophages in knockout and control mice. 1. Control unstimulated 2. Knockout unstimulated 3. Control lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated (4h) 4. Knockout LPS stimulated (4h). Three replicates for each condition. Thus, a total of 12 samples.
