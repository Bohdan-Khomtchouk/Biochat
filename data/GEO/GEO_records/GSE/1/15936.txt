TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae under serial stresses

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
S. cerevisae cells were exposed to different series of mild stresses. Stress type include heat shock, oxidative and osmotic stresses. Microarrays were used to follow the genome-wide transcriptional response to the stresses and to identify genes that can underlie the cross protection phenotype between heat shock and oxidative stress. Keywords: time course
