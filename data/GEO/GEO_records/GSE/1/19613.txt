TITLE
Expression profiling of hybrid necrosis in triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes to alter the transcript accumulation levels in hybrid necrosis-showing plants, which are triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat and diploid wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii. Of the up-regulated genes, defense-related genes were most frequently found, whereas photosythesis-related genes down-regulated in the type I necrosis line. To validate the microarray data, RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analyses for 22 selected genes were performed. Of the examined 15 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated genes, the expression pattern of only one down-regulated gene was inconsistent with the microarray data. Together with cytological analysis of the necrotic tissues, the microarray analysis strongly suggests that an autoimmune response might be triggered by intergenomic incompatibility between the AB and D genomes in type I necrosis, and that genetically programmed cell death could be regarded as a hypersensitive response-like cell death similar to that observed in Arabidopsis intraspecific and Nicotiana interspecific hybrids.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between the two synthetic hexaploid lines showing the wild-type phenotype (as a reference) and hybrid necrosis. Total RNA samples were isolated from the 3-week-old seedling leaves. Two independent experiments were conducted.
