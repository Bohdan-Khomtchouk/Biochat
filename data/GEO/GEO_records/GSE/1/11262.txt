TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis Seed Compartments at the Globular Embryo Stage.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected globular stage seed compartments from 5 or 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of an Arabidopsis seed containing a globular stage embryo. For the purposes of this study we broke down the seed into 8 capturable compartments: embyro proper, suspensor, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, general seed coat, and whole seeds. Keywords: cell type comparison
