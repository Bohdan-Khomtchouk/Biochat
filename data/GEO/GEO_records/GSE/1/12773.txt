TITLE
Expression data from airway epithelial cell-conditioned monocyte-derive dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells differentiate from their precursors in the airway mucosa under local environmental instruction.  Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are a potent source of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and are in intimate contact with intraepithelial DC and their precursors. Thus, AEC are likely candidates for influencing this differentiation process in order to tailor the DC for optimal function in the airway mucosa. We used Affymetirx microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of monocyte derived DC (MDDC) populations differentiated with IL-4 and GM-CSF in the presence or absence of 16HBE 14o- epithelial cells. Keywords: Comparison of two cell populations
