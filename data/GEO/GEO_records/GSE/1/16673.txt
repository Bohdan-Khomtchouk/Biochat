TITLE
GRO analysis of topoisomerase mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genomic Run-on analysis of topoisomerase mutants (top1-delta/top2ts or top2ts) has been conducted at reference temperature for wt strain and at non-permissive temperature for wt and mutant strains. Keywords: Genomic Run On

DESIGN
The analysis includes 3 repeats of the wild type strain (JCW25) at 30ºC and 3 more at 37ºC, 3 repeats of the top2ts mutant (JCW26) at 37ºC and 3 repeats of the double top1 (delta) top2ts mutant at 37ºC. A single genomic DNA hybridization on one of the filters can be used for normalization between gene probes if needed.
