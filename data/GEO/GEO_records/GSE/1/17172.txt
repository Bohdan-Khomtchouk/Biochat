TITLE
Expression profiling of Burkitt's lymphoma cells 24h after FOXM1 shRNA or MYB shRNA lentivirus-mediated transduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Burkitt's lymphoma ST486 cells were transduced with non-target control shRNA lentiviral vectors, FOXM1 shRNA, and MYB shRNA lentiviral vectors.  Total RNA was isolated 24h later. cRNA was produced with the standard one-step IVT protocol (Affymetix) and hybridized in U95Av2 gene chips (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
Experiment consists in 3 independent samples: Expression profiling of Burkitt's lymphoma cells 24h after non-target control shRNA lentiviral mediated transduction. Expression profiling of Burkitt's lymphoma cells 24h after FOXM1 shRNA lentiviral mediated transduction. Expression profiling of Burkitt's lymphoma cells 24h after MYB shRNA lentiviral mediated transduction. Data processing performed using MAS5 or GCRMA.
