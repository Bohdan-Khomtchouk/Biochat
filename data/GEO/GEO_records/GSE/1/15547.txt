TITLE
Expression profiling of HeLa cells at S and G2/M phases of mitotic cell cycle.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the mRNAs expression profile of HeLa cells between two phases of the mitotic cell cycle: S and G2/M phases. Results provide insight into the regulation of transcript levels during mitotic cell cycle progression.  HeLa cells were synchronized with double thymidine blockade (12 hours with 2 mM thymidine, 12 hours release, and 12 hours with 2 mM thymidine),  and cells were taken after 2 hours release (S phase) and 8 hours release (G2/M phase). Keywords: time course
