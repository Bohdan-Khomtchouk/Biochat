SUMMARY
Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is one of the most frequent occurring pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In the WHO classification scheme pediatric LBL is considered to be the same disease entity as pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, it is unclear whether the genetic basis of pediatric LBL development is similar to that of pediatric ALL. We performed genome-wide analyses of copy number aberrations in 12 T-LBL and 7 precursor B-cell LBL pediatric cases using high-resolution SNP-based array CGH. Similar to what previously has been found in T-ALLs, T-LBLs exhibited recurrent deletions of the CDKN2A locus, occurring in 92% of the cases. Additionally, we detected deletions of RB1 (16%), duplications of MYB (16%) and an amplification of ABL1 in one case. These results show that, similar to T-ALL,  the genomic alterations in T-LBL predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression. The majority of precursor B-cell LBLs was characterized by high-hyperdiploidy (71%), and showed high resemblance with high-hyperdiploid precursor B-cell ALLs.  These results show that, similar to T-ALL,  the genomic alterations in T-LBL predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression and that high-hyperdiploidy is a commen event in B-LBL. Taken together, our data suggest that pediatric LBLs and ALLs exhibit similar genomic abnormalities within confined immunophenotypic and cytogenetic subgroups, but that the representations of these subgroups differs between the two entities. Copy number detection was performed using CNAG2.0 software, Reference genomes are included in this data set Keywords: comparative genome hybridization
