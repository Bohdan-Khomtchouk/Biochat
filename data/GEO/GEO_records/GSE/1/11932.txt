TITLE
Comparison between E. coli K-12 MG1655 and E. coli K-12 LVM100 delta 5 TA mutant on biofilm cell development

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The role of six toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems on biofilm development was investigated (MazEF, RelBEF, ChpB, YefM-YoeB, DinJ-YafQ, and TomB-Hha).  Although these TA systems were reported previously to not impact bacterial fitness, we found that biofilm formation is decreased by toxins and increased by anti-toxins, in part, through YjgK.  Hence, one role of TA systems is to regulate biofilm formation.
