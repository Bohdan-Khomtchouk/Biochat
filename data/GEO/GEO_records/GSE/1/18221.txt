TITLE
Expression profiling of murine hemopoietic cell survival on cDNA arrays.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deregulated cell survival programs are a classical hallmark of cancer. We have previously identified a serine residue (Ser585) in the beta-c subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor that selectively and independently promotes cell survival. We now show that Ser585 phosphorylation is constitutive in 20/23 (87%) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples indicating that this survival-only pathway is frequently deregulated in leukemia. We performed a global expression screen to identify gene targets of this survival pathway and report a 138-gene beta-c Ser585-regulated transcriptome. Pathway analysis defines a gene network enriched for PI 3-kinase target genes as well as a cluster of genes involved in cancer and cell survival.

DESIGN
factorial design; factors: time x 2 & mutation, same RNA was used in both GSE18220 & GSE18221
