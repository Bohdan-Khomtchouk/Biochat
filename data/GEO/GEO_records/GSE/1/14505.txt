TITLE
Effect of BDNF on aging-related gene expression changes in young and aged rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Patterns of gene expression in the aged entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were examined one month after entorhinal administration of BDNF lentivirus. Whole-genome patterns of expression were examined using Affymetrix arrays four weeks after entorhinal injection of lentiviral-BDNF or GFP injection compared to control subjects. Keywords: Treatment effect
