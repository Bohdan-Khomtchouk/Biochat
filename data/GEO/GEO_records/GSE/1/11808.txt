TITLE
Gene expression change in the liver of tumor bearing mice by TSU68 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSU68, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRÎ²) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), on colon cancer liver metastasis and to test the hypothesis that TSU68 modulates the microenvironment in the liver before the formation of metastasis.
