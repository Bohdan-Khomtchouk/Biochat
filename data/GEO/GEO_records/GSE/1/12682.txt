Expression data from Human Kidney (HK) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Males are 50% more likely to develop end stage kidney failure compared to women. In this study we wanted to find out the molecular mechanism responsible for this increased risk. We collected kidney samples from patients with and without kidney disease and performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis in healthy and diseased male and female kidneys. Interestingly, the set of gender biased genes in healthy kidneys were different from those in diseased kidneys indicating not only baseline gene expression differences but also that the male and female kidney respond differently to disease condition. Our studies indicate that men and women with kidney problems might need to be treated differently. Keywords: Gender difference
