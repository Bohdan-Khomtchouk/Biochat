TITLE
GSK3 inhibition Induces Glioma Cell Death through c-MYC, NF-kB and Glucose Regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified GSK3 as a regulator of GBM cell survival using microarray analysis, small molecule and genetic inhibitors of GSK3 activity.  Various molecular and genetic approaches were then employed to dissect out the molecular mechanisms responsible for GSK3 inhibition-induced cytotoxicity. Keywords: time course
