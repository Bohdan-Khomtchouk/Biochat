TITLE
Inflammatory response of trout head kidney to in vivo challenge with IHN virus and LPS

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The response of the trout, O.mykiss, head kidney to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or active and attenuated infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV and attINHV respectively) intraperoniteal challenge, 24 and 72 hours post-injection, was investigated using a salmonid-specific cDNA microarray. The head kidney response to i.p. LPS-induced inflammation in the first instance displays an initial stress reaction involving suppression of major cellular processes, including immune function, followed by a proliferative hematopoietic-type/biogenesis response 3 days after administration. The viral response at the early stage of infection highlights a suppression of hematopoietic and protein biosynthetic function and a stimulation of immune response. In fish infected with IHNV a loss of cellular function including signal transduction, cell cycle and transcriptional activity 72 hours after infection reflects the tissue-specific pathology of IHNV infection. attIHNV treatment on the other hand shows a similar pattern to native IHNV infection at 24 hours however at 72hours a divergence from the viral response is seen and replace with a recovery response more similar to that observed for LPS is observed.
