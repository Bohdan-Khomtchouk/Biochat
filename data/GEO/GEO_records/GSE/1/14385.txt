TITLE
Response of bronchial epithelial cells to low doses of cigarette smoke condensate and subsequent demethylation agent

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study seeks to identify the epigenetic changes caused by exposure of to cigarette smoke condensate. To this goal human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, were treated with 5-aza-2â€™deoxycitidine and  trychostatin A (5AzaC/TSA) subsequent to a chronic exposure (1 month) to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). As negative control served BEAS-2B cells that were untreated or treated with CSC/DMSO for one month without the subsequent application of 5Aza/TSA. Keywords: stress response
