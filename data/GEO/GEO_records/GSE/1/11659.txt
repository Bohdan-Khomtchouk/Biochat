TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in 9 BXH RI strains and progenitors (B6 and C3) and BXHF1.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the lungs of this RI panel are divergent thus contributing to the disparity in their phenotypes. More specifically, (1) B6 mice tend to have a much smaller lung volume than the C3 mice while the F1 appears to be like the B6 in lung structure and function. We postulate that their gene expression differences would reflect this. (2) The diversity in the phenotypes of this RI panel could be explained by a few genes whose expression spectrum across this panel could explain the physiological spectrum. In order to test these hypotheses at the gene expression level, we utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences among lungs of these strains of mice. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
