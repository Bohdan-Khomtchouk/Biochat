TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma Patient Tumor Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were generated from 41 consecutive surgically resected fresh frozen malignant peritoneal mesothelioma patient tumor samples to identify molecular prognostic factors.

DESIGN
Patient tumor samples hybridized against the common reference (complementary DNA generated from human universal RNA), 41 tumor samples.
