TITLE
Developmental time course of gene expression in Anopheles gambiae embryo

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
In order to examine the gene expression in the course of mosquito embryogenesis, microarray assays were performed on staged A. gambiae embryos, from fertilization to 52 hours of development (which is close to hatching at ~50 hours post-fertilization). RNA was extracted from staged embryos roughly every three hours after fertilization, and then hybridized to the A. gambiae transcriptome microarray. Keywords: time-course
