TITLE
Effect of Isoflurane and LTM on basolateral amygdala

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fear conditioning in rats leads to long term memory (LTM) formation. A central neural substrate for LTM is the basolateral amygdala. We sought the expression changes specific to LTM at 6h following anesthesia with isoflurane (a general anesthetic and an effective amnestic agent), following pain (a component of conditioning), and following conditioning in presence and absence of isoflurane.
