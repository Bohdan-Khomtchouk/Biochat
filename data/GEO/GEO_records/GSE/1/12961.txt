TITLE
Effect of dietary immunostimulation in the portals of entry of rainbow trout after LPS challenge

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were fed during 4 weeks with either a control diet or an immunostimulant diet and then injected with LPS to investigate the effect of dietary immunostimulation in the portals of entry, intestine and gills, using a salmonid-specific microarray platform enriched with immune-related genes. IS-diet feeding significantly changed transcriptomic expression profiles in response to LPS:  significant changes in genes and functional GO categories related to remodeling processes and antigen presentation were different for both diets. The results revealed that one of the main effects of IS-diets in trout is the increase of genes involved in antigen recognition and in adaptive immunity. Keywords: gills, intestine, immunostimulats, transcriptomic response, trout
