TITLE
Chromosomal duplication in the grandifolia-D mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The number of cells in an organ is a major factor for the determination of organ size. However, genetic basis of cell number determination is not well understood. Three grandifolia-D (gra-D) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana developed huge leaves containing two- to three-fold increased number of cells of the wild type. Tiling array and microarray analysis of gra-D mutants suggested that genes found in a lower part of chromosome 4 were upregulated, suggesting the occurrence of segmental chromosomal duplications in the gra-D mutants. These region contain positive regulators of cell proliferation such as  AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and cyclin genes such as CYCD3;1. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
