SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of normal cervix, CIN's and cancer cervix, with an intent to identify genes involved in the malignant transformation of normal cervix and to identify genes which can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Identification of genes for predicting radiation response using microarray gene expression studies Keywords: Patient tissue samples
