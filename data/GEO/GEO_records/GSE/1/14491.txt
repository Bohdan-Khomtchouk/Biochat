TITLE
TGFβ/mutant-p53 jointly controlled genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFβ ligands act as tumor suppressors in early stage tumors but are paradoxically diverted into potent prometastatic factors in advanced cancers. The molecular nature of this switch remains enigmatic. We now show that TGFβ-dependent cell migration, invasion and metastasis are empowered by mutant-p53. To investigate the specific gene expression program by which mutant-p53 and TGFβ control invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells, we compared the TGFβ transcriptomic profile of control and mutant-p53 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells. Keywords: expression profiling by array
