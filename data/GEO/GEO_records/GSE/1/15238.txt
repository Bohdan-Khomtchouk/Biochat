TITLE
Expression data from human embryonic (9-12w) and post-natal livers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The liver is a multifunctional organ, which undergoes rapid changes during the developmental period and relies on tightly-regulated gene expression. Little is known regarding the complex expression patterns of mRNAs during the early stages of human liver development in comparison to post-natal livers. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during liver development following specification, at the stage of proliferation and differentiation when compared to post-natal livers, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and downregulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Liver tissues of aborted human embryos (9-12 weeks from last period) and adult patients (1.5, 42 and 81 years) were obtained under an IRB approval for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. RNA extracted from tissues of a whole embryo without the liver tissue served as a control.
