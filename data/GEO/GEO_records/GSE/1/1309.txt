TITLE
Gene expession profiles for monoclonal cell lines with high or low levels of store-operated Ca2+ entry.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series of microarray experiments monitored the gene expression profiles for monoclonal cell lines (derived from HEK-293 parental cell culture) with high (H1, H15, H24, H36, H39) or low (L3, L28, L29) levels of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). For selection of clones, HEK-293 cells were loaded with indo-1 and sorted by FACS on the basis of their cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Monoclonal cell lines were selected from the sorted cells and their levels of SOCE confirmed by monitoring thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry. Total RNA was extracted from cells immediately after removal from their growth environment. RNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix HG-U133A chip. Two parallel hybridizations were done for each RNA preparation from each monoclonal cell line or from the parental HEK-293 cell culture. Keywords: parallel sample
