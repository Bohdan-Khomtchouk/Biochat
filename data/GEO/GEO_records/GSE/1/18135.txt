TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Androgen Modulated Genes in the Murine Fetal Developing Lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Accumulating evidences suggest that sex affects lung development. During the fetal period, male lung maturation is delayed compared with female and surfactant production appears earlier in female than in male fetal lungs. We analyzed by microarrays the expression of genes showing a sexual difference and those modulated by endogenous androgens (flutamide).

DESIGN
Following flutamide or vehicle administration to pregnant mothers, fetal mouse lungs were studied at gestational day 17 (GD17) and GD18. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
