TITLE
Expression data from Epiderm cultured skin derived from four different donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides a comparison of genes expressed in reconstructed cultured epidermis derived from four different donors. GeneChips were used to compare reconstructed human EpiDermâ„¢ EPI-200 tissues prepared from four different neonatal foreskin donors (254, 1188, 219 and 926).  This work will assist in providing a deeper understanding of genes expressed in cultured skin equivalents. Keywords: Cell type/donor comparison

DESIGN
20 total samples:  5 Replicates obtained from four different donors.
