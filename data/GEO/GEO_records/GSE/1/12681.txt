TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice stripe virus-infected rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice stripe virus (RSV) is one of the major virus diseases of rice in East Asia. Rice plants infected with RSV usually show symptoms such as chlorotic leaf stripes, weakness and senescence of leaves, and dwarfism. In order to characterize the host response to RSV infection at the gene expression level, the changes in transcriptome profiles of RSV-infected rice were monitored at three, six, nine, twelve, and fifteen days after inoculation by a rice oligomicroarray. The microarray data indicated that 1. transcription, translation and protein processing machineries were activated, 2. chloroplasts were disintegrated, and mitochondrion function was activated, 3. genes for transporters and cell wall synthesis were suppressed, and 4. the expression levels of pathogenesis-related genes were changed by RSV infection. Concurrent observation of symptom development, virus accumulation and transcriptome profiles in RSV-infected plants indicates that RSV symptoms are caused by unbalanced activities of organelles, suppression of cell elongation, and uncontrolled water transport, while translation activity of host cells may be increased in correlation with RSV propagation. Keywords: time course, virus infection, disease response
