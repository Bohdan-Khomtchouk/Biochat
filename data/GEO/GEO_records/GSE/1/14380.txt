TITLE
Gastrointestinal differentiation marker Cytokeratin 20 is regulated by homeobox gene CDX1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study is to identify downstream targets of homeobox gene CDX1. The study assayed the expression of 2 pairs of stably transfected colorectal cancer cell lines: The CDX1 nonexpressing CRC cell line HCT116 was stably transfected with either CDX1 cDNA in the pRC/CMV expression vector (HCT116-CDX1) or with vector control (HCT116-Vec). The CDX1-expressing CRC cell line LS174T was similarly transfected with either a pSilencer vector containing a short sequence of CDX1 siRNA (LS174T-siRNA) , or a pSilencer vector containing a scrambled siRNA sequence as a control (LS174T-Vec).
