TITLE
Untreated 32Dcl3 cell lines expressing oncogenic tyrosine kinases or cells treated with small molecule inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oncogenic tyrosine kinases, such as BCR-ABL, TEL-ABL, TEL-PDGF-beta-R and FLT3-ITD, play a major role in the development of hematopoietic malignancy.  They activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. To identify the critical target genes required for transformation in hematopoietic cells, we used a comparative gene expression strategy in which selective small molecules were applied to 32Dcl3 cells that had been transformed to factor-independent growth by these respective oncogenic alleles. Keywords: comparative gene expression analysis
