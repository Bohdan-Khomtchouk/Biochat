SUMMARY
Klf4 is the zinc finger transcription factor indispensable for terminal maturation of epithelial tissues and part of group of proteins for the generation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells from differentiated tissues. No definitive in-vivo-function of Klf4 in the hematopoietic system has been established yet. We show here that Klf4 directly guides the transcriptional program for terminal differentiation of Ly-6Chigh monocytes. Klf4 suppresses transcripts of the interferon immune response and induces a proinflammatory cytokine transcriptional program. Concordantly, Klf4 hematopoietic deficiency in mice results in an enhanced Th1 but impaired Th17 immune response, and, consequently, those mice are resistant towards the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). We here identify Klf4 is a transcription factor required for ontogenesis and function of Ly-6Chigh monocytes at the interface of innate and acquired immunity.
