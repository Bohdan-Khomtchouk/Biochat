TITLE
agrobacterium treatment-Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment. Gene profiling in microRNA mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - agrobacterium treatment - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - Col-0 plants were infected with wt Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain A208) by stabbing the emerging stems. 18 days later, growing tumors were harvested as were the non-infected part of the stabbed-stem.In parallel, Col-0 seeds were germinated on Callus Induction Media (CIM) and 18 days later, calli were harvested. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison,organ comparison
