TITLE
Expression profiles of E. coli groESL(-) cells expressing human Hsp60(wt)/Hsp10 or Hsp60-(p.Val98Ile)/Hsp10 operons

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
To identify regulatory responses that could give clues as to the cause(s) of the growth arrest observed in E. coli cells expressing mutant Hsp60-(p.Val98Ile) and Hsp10 versus cells expressing wild type Hsp60 and Hsp10, we performed microarray analyses. We reasoned that the decreased chaperonin activity of the Hsp60-(p.Val98Ile) protein would greatly impair or abolish folding of E. coli proteins that depend on chaperonin assistance. The resulting decreased levels of various activities may cause compensatory up-regulation or deregulation of genes. The transcriptomes of cells shifted to expression of the arabinose-inducible chaperonin operon with either the Hsp60-(p.Val98Ile) mutant or the wild type Hsp60 from the second plasmid were compared. RNA samples from three independent cultures expressing the mutant or two independent cultures expressing wild type Hsp60 were pooled, respectively. Keywords: Comparison of cells expressing two different variants of Hsp60
