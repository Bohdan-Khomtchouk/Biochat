TITLE
PAX3-FKHR regulated genes differentially expressed between alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overall goal and objective is to study the degree to which PAX3-FKHR accounts for differences between ARMS and ERMS by expressing a construct (termed P3FK/ER) consisting of PAX3-FKHR joined to the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain in an ERMS cell culture system.

DESIGN
In the study design, three populations of RD ERMS cells expressing P3FK/ER were treated with or without 30 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen and three control populations transduced with vector only (pK1) were similarly treated.
