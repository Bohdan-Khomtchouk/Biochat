TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Sox17-induced Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the effect of Sox17 overexpression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we performed gain-of-function analysis by generating ES cell lines carrying a doxycycline inducible FLAG-tagged Sox17 transgene. We treated Sox17-inducible ES cells with doxycycline, collected RNA and performed genome-wide transcriptional analysis. We found that genes invovled in adhesion function and basement membrane establishment were transcriptionally upregulated in ES cells upon induction of Sox17. We also observed downregulation in the transcription of genes involved in pathways known to be functionally important for ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal. However, Sox17 expression was not sufficient to rapidly down-regulate Sox2, Nanog, and Oct4.

DESIGN
Two independent doxycycline inducible Sox17-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells were derived. The genes expression changes in the Sox17-induced cells were compared to untreated (no doxycycline) controls and to control cells treated with or without doxycycline. The total RNA from these samples were amplified using Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit and arrayed on Illumina MouseRef8 v2 chips.
