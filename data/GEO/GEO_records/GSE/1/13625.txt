TITLE
A distinct class of small RNAs arises from pre-miRNA-proximal regions in a simple chordate

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages of the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. Surprisingly, half of the identified miRNA loci encode not two, but up to four distinct small RNAs.  These additional RNAs, termed “moRs”, are generated from sequences adjacent to the predicted ~60-nt pre-miRNA. moRs appear to be produced by RNAse-III-like processing, are ~20-nt in length, have 5’-monophosphate and 3’-hydroxl termini, and like miRNAs, are developmentally regulated.
