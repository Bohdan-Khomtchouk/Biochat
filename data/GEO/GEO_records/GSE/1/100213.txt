TITLE
Lineage-specific genetic innovations streamline the genomes of Armillaria species to pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Armillaria ostoyae

SUMMARY
Armillaria species are devastating forest pathogens that are among the largest terrestrial organisms on Earth. They explore hosts and achieve immense colony sizes by rhizomorphs, root-like multicellular structures of clonal dispersal. To resolve the genetic bases of their unique biology, we sequenced and analyzed genomes of 4 Armillaria species and performed RNA-Seq on 7 invasive and reproductive developmental stages. Comparison with 22 basidiomycete fungi revealed a significant genome expansion in Armillaria, affecting several pathogenicity-related genes, lignocellulose degrading enzymes and lineage-specific genes involved in rhizomorph development. Rhizomorphs express an evolutionarily young transcriptome and share their morphogenetic machinery with fruiting bodies, providing genetic and regulatory insights into complex multicellularity in fungi. Our results suggest that the evolution of the unique dispersal and pathogenicity mechanisms of Armillaria has drawn upon ancestral genetic toolkits for wood-decay, morphogenesis and complex multicellularity.

DESIGN
30 samples corresponding to 10 developmental stages were analyzed. Each developmental stage contains 3  biological replicates.
