TITLE
Hepatic expression data between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet in order to investigate the responses to that diet over time and their underlying genetic factors. We observed distinctly diverse responses between B6 and D2 mice, including dynamic distribution of cholesterol in serum and bile, hepatic apoptosis and dynamic formation of gallstones and atherosclerosis. Hepatic microarray analysis revealed distinctly different gene expression patterns in functional pathway groups including lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, immune/inflammation response and apoptosis, which might account for the different responses.This might provide us not only new insights into gallstones formation and atherosclerosis, but also opportunities to identify candidate genes for high-fat/high-cholesterol related diseases.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet in 0,1,4 12,21 weeks,respectively. Liver tissues of mice from each time-point were removed for RNA extraction.  Equal amounts of RNA samples from five mice of each strain at each time-point were pooled and then used to generate biotinylated cRNA targets for Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
