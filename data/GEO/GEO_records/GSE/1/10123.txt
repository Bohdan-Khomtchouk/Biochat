TITLE
Progerin-induced changes in gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is caused by constitutive production of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear architectural protein lamin A1.  Progerin is also sporadically expressed in wild type cells and has been linked to physiological aging.  HGPS cells exhibit extensive nuclear defects including abnormal chromatin structure and increased DNA damage.  At the organismal level, HGPS affects several tissues particularly of mesenchymal origin.  How the cellular defects of HGPS cells lead to the organismal defects has been unclear.  To begin to unravel how progerin leads to disease phenotypes, we analyzed time-dependent changes in transcriptional profiles in response to progerin expression in a hTERT-immortalized skin fibroblast cell line expressing either GFP-progerin or the  GFP-wt lamin A control Keywords: time course, cell line comparison
