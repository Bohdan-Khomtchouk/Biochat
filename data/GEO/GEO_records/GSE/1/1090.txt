SUMMARY
Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was used to identify and quantify all expressed cerebellar genes in the adult (P92; GSM17430) and aged (P810; GSM17226) C57BL/6J mouse cerebellum. A " closest-neighbor " algorithm was used to differentiate low abundance tags from possible sequencing errors in both libraries. Unique tags were categorized into four groups: (1) novel genes; (2) ESTs; (3) RIKEN, KIA, and hypothetical genes; and (4) known genes. Known genes were further subdivided into functional categories based on the gene ontology classification, using a web-based program developed in this laboratory (MmSAGEClass). Comparison of adult and aged cerebellar libraries revealed several genes that were differentially expressed, including growth hormone and prolactin, both of which were markedly decreased in the aged cerebellum. In addition, several tags showing differential expression were not identified in the Unigene database and are likely to represent novel genes. The present SAGE data on the aged cerebellar transcriptome may reveal candidate genes involved in the aging process. Keywords: other
