TITLE
Oxygen downshift experiment with E.coli W3110

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Dynamical response to oxygen downshift under fermentation conditions was tested by taking sample before (S1) and after (S2, S3 and S4) the oxygen downshift. The dynamical changes relevant for ongoing research on physiology were applied.
