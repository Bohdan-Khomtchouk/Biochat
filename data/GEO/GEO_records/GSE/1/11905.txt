Lichen Planopilaris and Pseudopelade of Brocq Involve Distinct Disease Associated Gene Expression Patterns by Microarray

SUMMARY
Lichen planopilaris (LPP) and pseudopelade of Brocq (PPB) are two scarring alopecia diagnoses that often exhibit similar clinical features. Some suggest LPP and PPB are not distinct diseases, but rather different clinical presentations in a spectrum derived from the same underlying pathogenetic mechanism. We explored the degree of similarity between LPP and PPB gene expression patterns and the potential for common and unique gene pathway and gene activity in LPP and PPB using microarrays. Microarray analysis, using a 21K cDNA set was performed on pairs of biopsies obtained from affected and unaffected scalp of untreated patients (4 LPP and 4 PPB biopsy pairs). Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified by analysis of microarray results in various data sets and screened for signaling pathway involvement. Selected genes were validated by quantitative PCR and immunohistology. The global gene expression profiles in LPP and PPB versus comparative intra-control scalp tissue were distinguishable by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). Specific genes, such as MMP11, were identified with significantly differential expression in association with LPP versus PPB. There was very limited commonality in the gene expression profiles between LPP and PPB. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of LPP and PPB at the molecular level. Results suggest LPP and PPB involve different mechanisms of disease development and can be regarded as biologically distinct cicatricial alopecia diagnoses. Genes that we have identified may potentially be useful as markers of the respective diagnoses.
