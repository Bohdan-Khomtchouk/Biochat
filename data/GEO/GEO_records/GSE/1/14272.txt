TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide on Mycobacterium bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Mycobacterium bovis BCG GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Mycobacterium bovis BCG to hydrogen peroxide, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study
