TITLE
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma - Pleomorphic Sarcoma, NOS -Gene expression, Histology and clinical course -A pilot study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was performed to identify gene expression differences in not otherwise specified soft tissue sarcomas (NOS, malignant fibrous histiocytomas) and correlate them to histological findings and the clinical course. RNA was isolated and differential gene expression was analysed by the microarray technique. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression differences between primary soft tissue sarcoma samples, harvested intraoperatively. Keywords: response to chemotherapeutic agent
