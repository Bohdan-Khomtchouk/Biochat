TITLE
Serial time induction by TPA on BCBL-1 cells in the absence or presence of viral replication inhibitor cidofovir

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BCBL-1 cells were induced with 20 ng/ml TPA either in the absence (U) or presence (+) of 100 ÂµM cidofovir (CDV) treatment and collected at 0, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 hours (h) post-TPA addition, and compared against untreated (U), uninduced latent BCBL-1 reference cells. Three biological repeats were performed. Keywords = Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Keywords = KSHV Keywords = human herpesvirus type 8 Keywords = HHV-8 Keywords = primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells Keywords = body-cavity based lymphoma-1 (BCBL-1) cells Keywords = lytic induction Keywords = 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) Keywords = viral replication inhibition Keywords = cidofovir (CDV) Keywords: time-course
