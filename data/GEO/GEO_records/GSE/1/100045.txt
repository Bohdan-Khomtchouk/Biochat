TITLE
RNA-seq of C. elegans worms treated with RNAi toward daf-2 or cav-1 or left untreated (EV) to compare gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We observed functional outcomes of cav-1 knockdown and wanted to characterize changes in gene expression profiles following this manipulation. To address this, we treated nematodes with daf-2 or cav-1 RNAi and compared gene expression profiles to these of untreated worms. The knockdown of cav-1 resulted in modulation in the expression of 92 genes, and some of them overlapped with genes which were affected by knockdown of daf-2.

DESIGN
We performed two biological repeats. Each repeat we had 3 samples: (1) worms that were left untreated (EV), (2) worms that were treated with RNAi toward daf-2, and  (3) worms that were treated with RNAi toward cav-1.
