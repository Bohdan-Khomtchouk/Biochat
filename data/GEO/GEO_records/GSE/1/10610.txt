TITLE
Expression data from mouse germline stem (GS), multipotent germline stem (mGS), and embryonic stem (ES) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A single spermatogonial stem cell can aquire pluripotentiality but that conversion into a pluripotent cell type is accompanied by loss of spermatogenic potential. We used microarrays to compare the expression profiles among the different stem cell types. Keywords: cell type comparison
