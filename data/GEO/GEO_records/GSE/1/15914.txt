Interleukin-7 promotes monocyte/macrophage arrest on endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: It is recognized that atherosclerosis can regresses at least in animal models. However, little is known about the mechanisms. We induced regression of advanced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (APOE­/­) mice and studied underlying mechanisms. Unexpectedly, our study led to the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in atherogenesis. Methods and Results: We treated APOE­/­ mice fed a high cholesterol diet for 30 weeks to induce advanced lesions with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector expressing human apoE3 (HDAd-gE3), and analyzed the regression of atherosclerosis after 41 weeks. Using microarray analysis, we identified IL-7 as one of most significantly affected genes by lowering cholesterol. To answer why IL-7 is downregulated by reduced cholesterol, we studied effects of IL-7 on endothelial cells (ECs). Our major findings were (1) long-term lowering cholesterol induced regression of advanced atherosclerosis. (2) Microarray analysis identified multiple signaling pathways affected by lowering cholesterol. (3) Correction for multiple testing revealed that IL-7 expression was downregulated, whereas gamma-sarcoglycan and Î±-actin were upregulated. (4) Oxidized LDL upregulated IL-7 expression in macrophages but not in aorta ECs or smooth muscle cells. (5) IL-7 increased the expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokine in ECs and promoted monocyte adhesion to ECs. (6) Systemic elevation of IL-7 induced inflammatory response and recruited monocyte/macrophage to the lesions without increasing plasma cholesterol. Conclusion: Our finding suggest that IL-7 inflames endothelium and triggers the adhesion/recruitment of monocyte/macrophages to the atherosclerotic lesions and thus plays a direct role in development of atherosclerosis.

DESIGN
Female APOE-/- mice (8 weeks of age) on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and were fed a diet containing 0.2% (w/w) cholesterol and 10% (v/w) coconut oil to induce atherosclerosis for 30 weeks. Mice were then divided into 3 groups,  (n=15/group), treated with a tail vein injection of helper-dependent adenovirus expressing human apolipoprotein E3 (HDAd-gE3, 5 x 1012 viral particles/kg, n=11, vector), empty vector (HDAd-0, 5 x 1012 VP/kg, n=11, vector control) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, vehicle) and sacrificed 10 days after. Three aortas extending sinus to arch were pooled for RNA extraction with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).
