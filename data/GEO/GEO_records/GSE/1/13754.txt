TITLE
Gene expression profiles of progestin-induced canine mammary hyperplasia and spontaneous mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Spontaneous mammary tumours are the most prevalent type of neoplasm in women as well as in female dogs. Even though ovarian hormones, mainly estrogens and progestins, are known to play a key role in mammary tumorigenesis, conflicting reports have been obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies concerning their role, especially of progestins, in mammary tumorigenesis. Prolonged exposure to high levels of progestins during unusually long luteal phase of oestrous cycle is suspected to be the key event in canine mammary tumorigenesis.  Accordingly, our previous studies have shown development of mammary hyperplasia in dogs upon prolonged progestin administration. In this study, we used canine cDNA microarrays to identify oncogenic determinants in progestin-induced canine hyperplasia (CMH) and spontaneous tumours (CMC) by comparing them to normal tissue. CMH profile indicated amplification of genes involved in cell proliferation, like PCNA, NPY and RAN, and also alterations in expression of transcription factors and cell adhesion molecules. In addition to amplified cell proliferation signature, CMC profile also identified major alterations in expressions of genes involved in cell motility, cytoskeletal organization and extracellular components. Overall, gene expression profile of CMH indicated an advantage for cell proliferation, whereas that of CMC indicated an advantage for proliferation as well as neoclassic transformation.  In conclusion, our findings indicate strong oncogenic potential of progestins in canine mammary gland. In addition, CMC gene expression profile greatly contribute to the identification of their molecular abnormalities and may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets.
