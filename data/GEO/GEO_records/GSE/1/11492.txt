TITLE
Transcript Profiling of High Fat Diet induced Obesity-prone and Obesity-resistant Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rodents respond to chronic high fat diet in at least two ways: some of them may readily gain body weight and become obese (termed obesity-prone), and others may not (termed obesity-resistant).  An integrated approach of transcript and metabolic profiling of obesity-prone and obesity-resistant rats has been conducted, showing significantly different transcript and metabolic profiles in the two phenotypes.  The major transcriptional differences involved hepatic fatty acid metabolism and ketogenesis in response to 16 weeks of high fat diet.  At the same time, the different metabolic profiles (in liver tissue extracts, serum, and urine) between the two phenotypes could be ascribed to the corresponding pathways identified with multivariate statistical analysis, including fatty acid metabolism, Krebs cycle, and amino acid metabolism.  The integration of results from both transcript and metabolic profiling revealed the different responses to dietary intervention of the two phenotypes and the physiological basis of susceptibility to metabolic disease in obesity-prone rats from a systematic view.
