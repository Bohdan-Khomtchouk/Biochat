TITLE
SLFN11 blocks stressed replication forks independently of ATR (NS-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SLFN11 sensitizes cells to a broad range of DNA damaging agents, yet through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that, in response to replication stress, SLFN11 binds replication forks via RPA1 and the replication helicase MCM3, and blocks replication irreversibly. The ATPase domain of SLFN11 is required for this replication block. Unlike ATR, SLFN11 does not affect the loading of CDC45 and PCNA to replication forks and does not inhibit initiation of DNA replication, but specifically blocks fork progression. Whole genome replication origin mapping (nascent strand DNA-seq) and open chromatin region mapping (ATAC-seq) reveal that in response to replication stress SLFN11 loosens chromatin in the vicinity of replication origins. SLFN11 is also recruited to and blocks replication elongation in response to the CHK1 inhibitor LY2606368 that activates unscheduled origin firing. We conclude that SLFN11 is recruited to stressed replication forks carrying extended RPA filaments where it blocks replication by loosening chromatin.

DESIGN
Nascent strands were purified with the lambda exonuclease methods from CCRF-CEM parental and SLFN11-KO (knockout) cell lines, which were treated with DMSO,  100 nM camptothecine or 100 nM camptothecin plus 2 uM VE-821 (ATR inhibitor) for 4 hrs.
