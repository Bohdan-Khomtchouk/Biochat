TITLE
Transcriptome of GATA3 knocked-down and normal keratinocytes after 1 cGy X irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the consequences of the GATA3 silencing on the transcriptome of X-rays irradiated keratinocytes. Oligonuclotide microarrays were used to assess transcriptional changes over a time-course between 3 and 72h post-irradiation in a GATA3 knocked-down background (shGATA3) or in a normal background (ShSCR).  Primary human keratinocytes were cultured in a semi-defined medium and then infected either with shGATA3 or with ShSCR lentiviral particles . Cells were then cultured 5 to 8 days up to confluence and then submitted to an 1 cGy dose of X-rays. Total RNA was extracted 4, 24, 48 or 72 hours after irradiation. After RNA amplification and labeling, gene profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays (26 068 probes) to compare 1 cGy irradiated cells to sham-irradiated cells at individual times.

DESIGN
Dye-swap hybridization were performed. Slides were scanned with a Genepix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For each hybridized spot, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence values were obtained by using Genepix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments) and were saved as a result file
