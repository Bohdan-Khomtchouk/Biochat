TITLE
ChIP-chip from HCT116 cells with UbH2B and H3K4me2 coupled to expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone H2B monoubiquitylation has been implicated in transcription. We generated anti-UbH2B antibodies and applied these antibodies in ChIP-chip experiments revealing preferential association of ubiquitylated H2B with the transcribed regions of highly expressed genes. Unlike dimethylated H3K4, UbH2B was not associated with distal promoter regions. Keywords: Chip-chip, Expression analysis
