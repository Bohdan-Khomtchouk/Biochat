TITLE
Differential expression of Aedes aegypti salivary gland transcriptome upon blood feeding

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
We have developed an oligoGEArray with 434 genes from Ae. aegypti salivary gland. OligoGEArray was customized with the salivary gland genes chosen from the transcriptome source published by Ribeiro et al (2007). Oligonucleotides (60bp) were designed and array were manufactured by SABiosciences.  Using this OligoGEArray, we analyzed the differential expression of salivary trancritptome upon blood feeding.

DESIGN
Salivary glands were dissected from 1, 3, 24 and 48 hours post fed (hpf) and unfed Ae. aegypti. Total RNA were extracted and the differential expression of transcriptome were analysed.  Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed on selected genes to validate the OligoGEArray data.
