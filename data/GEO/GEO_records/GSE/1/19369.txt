TITLE
Stimulatory effect of Echinacea purpurea extract on trafficking activity in mouse dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To seek scientific evidence supporting therapeutic use of Echinacea, the transcriptomic effects of Echinacea purpurea extract on mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were analyzed using primary cultures. Affymetrix DNA microarray and bioinformatics analyses of genes differentially expressed in DCs treated with [BF/S+L/Ep] for 4 or 12 h revealed that the majority of responsive genes were related to cell adhesion or motility (Cdh10, Itga6, Cdh1, Gja1 and Mmp8), or were chemokines (Cxcl2, Cxcl7) or signaling molecules (Nrxn1, Pkce and Acss1).

DESIGN
BMDCs from mice were treated with [BF/S+L/Ep] or DMSO for 4 h or 12 h in duplicates.
