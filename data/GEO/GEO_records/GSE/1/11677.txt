Gene expression profiles of age-associated clonal expansions of CD8 memory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many aged individuals develop monoclonal expansions of CD8 T cells.  These expansions are derived from a CD8 memory T cell that outcompetes neighboring CD8 T cells.  The molecular alterations within clonal expansions that confer this competitive advantage relative to other CD8 T cells remains unknown.  These microarray experiments were designed to identify genes differentially expressed in age-associated expansions of CD8 memory T cells relative to polyclonal CD8 memory T cells found in the same aged mice. Subsequent analysis of these data identified two major types of clonal expansions, distinguished by expression level of integrin a4 mRNA and protein.  Based on this classification, Expansion_rep1 belongs to the integrin a4 high subtype of clonal expansions.  In contrast, reps 2, 4, and 5 belong to the integrin a4 low subtype of clonal expansions.  Given the divergent biological properties of these two subtypes of clonal expansions, we have focused genes differentially expressed between Expansion_rep 2, 4, and 5 and their paired PolyclonalAged samples.
