TITLE
Expression profile after β-TrCP inhibition and androgen ablation in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression of LAPC4 cells after knocking down β-TrCP, androgen ablation, or the combined treatments compared to non treated cells.

DESIGN
Using lentiviral vectors, we stably infected LAPC4 cells with specific shRNA targeted for both β-TrCP isoforms (i.e. 1 and 2) or GFP vector as control. To establish androgen ablation we treated the cells with charcoal stripped serum (CSS).
