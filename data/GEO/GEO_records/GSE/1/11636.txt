TITLE
Correlating global gene regulation to morphogenesis and maturation in the chick extra-embryonic vascular system

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Formation of blood vessels requires the concerted regulation of an unknown number of genes in a spatial-, time- and dosage-dependent manner. We investigated vascular development in vivo by determining global gene regulation throughout the formation of the chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM).  Our study provides a comprehensive molecular map of vascular maturation during developmental angiogenesis and might thus be a valuable resource to streamline further research of candidates susceptible to mediate pathological angiogenesis.
