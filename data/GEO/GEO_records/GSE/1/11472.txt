TITLE
Gene expression signature of cerebellum hypoplasia in a mouse model of Down syndrome (Part II).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We designed a large scale gene expression study in cerebellar external granular layer in Ts1Cje mice at P0 in order to measure the effects of trisomy 21 on in a enriched cell population (dissected layer) that is affected in Down syndrome in order to correlate gene expression changes to the phenotype observed. Keywords: Down syndrome, Ts1Cje, EGL, hypoplasia
