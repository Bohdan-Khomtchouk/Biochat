TITLE
Global gene expression changes including drug metabolism and disposition induced by three-dimensional culture of HepG2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found constitutive upregulation and higher degree induction of drug metabolism and disposition-related genes in a three-dimensional HepG2 culture. The upregulated genes are those believed to be regulated by different regulatory factors. The global gene expression analysis by Affymetrix GeneChip indicated that altered expressions of microtubule-related genes may change expressed levels of drug metabolism and disposition genes.  Stabilization of the microtubule molecules with docetaxel, a tubulin stabilizing agent, in the two-dimensional culture showed gene expression patterns similar to those in the three-dimensional culture, indicating that culture environment affects drug metabolism functions in HepG2 cells.
