TITLE
Mutant analysis of C. elegans small RNAs, 5p-end-independent

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These datasets profile the expression of small RNAs with 3p hydroxyls (including endo-siRNAs, miRNAs, and 21U-RNAs) in young adult worms from the wt and prg-1 mutant backgrounds.  They were prepared using an approach that captures small RNAs independent of the covalent status of their 5p termini, as described in Ambros et al. (2003) Curr Biol 13:807-18. These datasets were prepared in the Craig C. Mello laboratory. Keywords: endo-siRNA mutant expression profiling
