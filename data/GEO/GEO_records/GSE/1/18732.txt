TITLE
mRNA expression data from skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray technology to profile mRNA expression in the skeletal muscle of normal (NGT), glucose intolerant (IGT) and type 2 diabetic (DM) subjects. Groups were classified using WHO criteria and, importantly, the DM group were free of anti hypoglycaemic medication for one week prior to biopsy.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the vastus lateralis of normal (NGT), glucose intolerant (IGT) and type 2 diabetic (DM) subjects (n = 118 in total) who had been free of hypoglycemic medication for one week. RNA was hybridized to Affymetric HGU133plus2 platform following manufacturer's directions.
