TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Blimp1-sufficient (Ctrl) and Blimp1-deficient (CKO) CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) and Foxp3- effector (Teff) T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of regulation of gene expression by Blimp1 in regulatory and effector CD4+ T cells. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Blimp1 differentially regualte gene expression in different T cell subsets. Results provide important information of mechanisms underlying regulation of gene expression by Blimp1 in T cells

DESIGN
Allotype marked Foxp3GFP reporter Blimp1-sufficient and Blimp1-deficient na√Øve (CD4+CD44low) T cells were transferred at a 1:1 ratio to RAG1-/- mice. Six-eight weeks later cells were sorted based on Foxp3, CD4 and allotype marker expression, generating 4 different groups (Blimp1 sufficient and Blimp1-defficent regulatory (CD4+Foxp3+) and Blimp1-sufficient and Blimp1-deficient effector (CD4+Foxp3-) T cells
