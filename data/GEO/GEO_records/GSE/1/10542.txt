TITLE
Similar patterns of additive and non-additive gene expression in maize hybrids with varying levels of heterosis - 70mer

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Expression profiling analyses for 5 maize inbreds and 4 hybrids, chosen to represent diversity in genotypes and heterosis responses, revealed a correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation. This is a companion dataset to an Affymetrix profiling experiment (GEO Series GSE10236). Keywords: Genotype comparison series
