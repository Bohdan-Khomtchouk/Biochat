SUMMARY
Garlic is a popular flavor enhancer in modern cuisines. Although anti-atherosclerotic, anti-proliferative, hypolipidemic and chemopreventative effects of garlic are known for a long time, the mechanisms of garlic as a dietary supplement ramain largely unknown. We used microarrays to analyze the global programme of gene expression in control (cellulose) and garlic-fed mice and identified erythropoietic and heme biosynthetic genes that could, in part, be responsible for the pleiotropic effects of garlic on health Keywords: diet, garlic
