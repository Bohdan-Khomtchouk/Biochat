TITLE
Global survey of miRNA microarray of uterus, ovariectomized female mice with or without estrogen (E2) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the effect of E2 treatment for the miRNA expression, at 15 week old, female wiled type mice were ovariectomized, and after one week, estradiol (E2) was delivered at a concentration of 0.050 mg/kg body weight/day. 24 hours after chemical treatment, uteruses from mice treated with or without E2 were dissected.
