TITLE
Genome sequence of the ectophytic fungus Ramichloridium luteum reveals unique evolutionary adaptations to plant surface niche

ORGANISM
Ramichloridium luteum

SUMMARY
We sequenced the complete genome of an ectophytic fungus, Ramichloridium luteum, which colonizes the surface of apple fruit, and carried out comparative genomic and transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
Mycelia from artificial inoculations onto apple fruit after 3 months in the field were used as ‘in planta’ samples for RNA sequencing. For ‘in vitro’ mycelium, R. luteum was cultured in liquid Czapek-Dox medium.Three independent biological samples were collected for RNA extraction and sequencing, using an Illumina HiSeq™ 2500 sequencing platform.
