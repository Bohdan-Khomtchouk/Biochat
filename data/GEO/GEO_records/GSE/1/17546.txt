Expression data from immortal and senescence-programmed Huh7 clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a tumor suppressor mechanism, and immortalization facilitates neoplastic transformation. Both mechanisms may be highly relevant to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and its molecular heterogeneity. Cellular senescence appears to play a major role in liver diseases. Chronic liver diseases are associated with progressive telomere shortening leading senescence that is observed highly in cirrhosis, but also in some HCC. We previously described the generation of immortal and senescence-programmed clones from HCC-derived Huh7 cell line. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression profiles of immortal and senescent-programmed clones.
