TITLE
Gene exprssion profile classification predicts clinical outcome in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis identified a specific signature of differentially expressed genes discriminating good and poor responders in JMML patients. Gene expression signatures were analyzed on two EWOG patient cohorts of pediatric JMML patients. Keywords: Expression data

DESIGN
Class comparison between AML-like vs non-AML-like signatures in JMML patients.
