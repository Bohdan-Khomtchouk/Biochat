TITLE
Intramuscular fat variability in pigs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intramuscular (i.m.) fat content influencing consumerâ€™s acceptability of pork is considered as a limiting factor for meat quality. To gain insight into the biological basis of individual variability in i.m. fat content, both gene expression profiling and proteomic investigation were associated in pig longissimus muscle (LM). Keywords: intramuscular fat, gene expression, pigs, proteomics, microarray, pork meat
