TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1 VNG1451C deletion mutant growth in defined medium with and without glucose

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Gene regulatory networks play an important role in coordinating biochemical fluxes through diverse metabolic pathways.  The modulation of enzyme levels enables efficient utilization of limited resources as organisms dynamically acclimate to nutritional fluctuations in their environment.  Here we have identified and characterized a novel nutrient-responsive transcription factor from the halophilic archaea, VNG1451C. In this experiment we used whole-genome microarray analysis in the VNG1451C deletion mutant vs. H. salinarum NRC-1 ura3 parent strain in defined medium during growth with and without glucose to show that the expression of many metabolic genes is perturbed in the VNG1451C deletion mutant in response to this sugar.
