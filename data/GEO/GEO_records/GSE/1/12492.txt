TITLE
Screen of oligonucleotides for microarray transcriptome analysis of Populus deltoides and P. trichocarpa

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a set of 6-7 long oligonucleotide probes developed based on the sequence of the Populus trichocarpa genome, that are optimal for gene expression analysis of P. deltoides and a hybrid of P. deltoides and P. trichocarpa. To evaluate these probes, multiple tissues (differentiating xyle, leaf and whole-root) of a pure P. deltoides and a hybrid (P. deltoides X P. trichocarpa) were transcript profiled for identification of one or more probes that are not biased towards one or the other genotype.
