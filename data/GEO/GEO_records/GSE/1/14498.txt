SUMMARY
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99A, so called Xoo, is disable to infect in rice cultivar carrying Xa21 gene. Disrupted mutant of raxR gene, response regulator of two-component regulatory system (TCS), in Xoo was previously shown to partially retrieve back the bacterial capability to establish in Xa21 rice. RaxR was shown to mediate the expression of other rax gene operon members and also its expression is changed dependent on cell population density. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms mediated by RaxR using whole-genome transcriptional profiling analysis in comparison of (i) PXO99R (PXO99 strain lacking RaxR) vs. PXO99, (ii) PXO99Rox (PXO99 strain overexpressing RaxR) vs. PXO99, and (iii) PXO99Rox vs. PXO99R. As a result of array analysis, we revealed that RaxR is not only required for AvrXa21 activitiy, it also plays roles in regulatory functions, for example, pathogenicity, motility, and stress tolerance. Then, we generated knock out mutants of RaxR regulon members to validate regulatory functions of RaxR and to extend other biological impacts of RaxR beyond the Xoo AvrXa21 activity. The combined interpretation from array analysis and mutant functional validation presents the complexity of regulatory pathways between AvrXa21 activity and other biological activities in Xoo.
