TITLE
Transcriptome modulation analysis of cytomegalovirus-infected immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) at 6h and 48h after infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) versus non infected. CMV tends to induce immunosuppression followed by lasting immunity. DCs appear to play a role in this effect. Results provide insights into CMV/DC interactions and suggest mechanisms for CMV-regulated early immune response. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count
