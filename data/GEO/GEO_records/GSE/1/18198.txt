TITLE
Expression profile of human T-ALL cell lines treated with DMSO or SAHM1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NOTCH proteins regulate signaling pathways involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and death. Overactive Notch signaling as been observed in numerous cancers and has been extensively studied in the context of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) where more than 50% of pateints harbour mutant NOTCH1. Small molecule modulators of these proteins would be important for understanding the role of NOTCH proteins in malignant and normal biological processes. We were interested to measure the global changes in gene expression upon treatment of the  human T-ALL cell lines HPB-ALL and KOPT-K1 with either vehicle alone (DMSO) or SAHM1, an alpha-helical hydrocarbon stapled peptide derived from the MAML1 co-activator protein.

DESIGN
Triplicate cultures of KOPT-K1 or HPB-ALL cells were treated with either DMSO alone or SAHM1 (20 uM) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 microarrays (three arrays per treatment per cell line for a total of 12 arrays).
