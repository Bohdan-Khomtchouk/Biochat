TITLE
Gene expression in colon cancer stem cells (CSC) cultures identified by Wnt signaling levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary colon CSC cultures were transduced with a Wnt responsive construct (TOP-GFP) and were single cell cloned. 10% highest and lowest TOP-GFP cell fractions were FACS sorted and arrayed.

DESIGN
Primary colon CSC cultures with a responsive construct (TOP-GFP): high and low TOP-GFP cell fractions. 4 samples.
