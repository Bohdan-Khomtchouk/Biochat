TITLE
Drosophila Polycomb and Pleiohomeotic genomic binding in 0-16h embryos and L3 larval discs (ChIP-on-chip)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have studied the linkage between the binding of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins and the developmental regulation of gene expression using whole-genome mapping to identify sites bound by the PcG proteins, Polycomb (Pc) and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), in the Drosophila embryo and in a more restricted tissue, the imaginal discs of the third thoracic segment. Our data provide considerable support for the idea that Pho is a general component of the maintenance machinery since the majority of Pc targets are also associated with Pho binding.  We find, in general, considerable developmental stability of Pc and Pho binding at target genes and observe that Pc/Pho binding can be associated with both expressed and inactive genes. In particular, at the Hox complexes both active and inactive genes have significant Pc and Pho binding; however, in comparison to inactive genes the active Hox genes show reduced and altered binding profiles. Keywords: ChIP-on-chip, tissue-specific binding
