SUMMARY
Cytoskeletal tension is an intracellular mechanism through which cells convert a mechanical signal into a biochemical response, including production of cytokines and activation of various signaling pathways.  Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) were allowed to spread into large cells by seeding them at a low-density (1,250 cells/cm2), which was observed to induce osteogenesis.  Conversely, ASCs seeded at a high-density (25,000 cells/cm2) featured small cells that promoted adipogenesis.  RhoA and actin filaments were altered by changes in cell size.  Blocking actin polymerization by Cytochalasin D influenced cytoskeletal tension and differentiation of ASCs.  To understand the potential regulatory mechanisms leading to actin cytoskeletal tension, cDNA microarray was performed on large and small ASCs.  Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was identified as a major regulator of osteogenesis associated with RhoA mediated cytoskeletal tension.  Subsequently, knock-down of CTGF by siRNA in ASCs inhibited this osteogenesis.  Therefore, we conclude that cytoskeletal tension is important for CTGF-regulated ASC osteogenic differentiation.
