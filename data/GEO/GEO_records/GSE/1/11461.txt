TITLE
Differential SAGE analysis in Arabidopsis uncovers increased transcriptome complexity in response to low temperature

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Five SAGE libraries were generated from A. thaliana leaf tissue collected at time points ranging from 30 minutes to one week of low temperature treatment (4°C).  Over 240,000 high quality SAGE tags, corresponding to 16,629 annotated genes, provided a comprehensive survey of changes in the transcriptome in response to low temperature, from perception of the stress to acquisition of freezing tolerance. Keywords: SAGE; time course; stress response; cold acclimation; freezing tolerance
