TITLE
A sexually dimorphic

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BDNF Val66Met mice, a model that is genetically susceptible to stress, recapitulated the translational effects of acute stress in the absence of applied stressors. However, unstressed heterozygous BDNF Val66Met mice did not display activation of immediate early genes, indicating a “pre-stressed” translational phenotype.

DESIGN
Examination of  the effect of stress and a SNP in male and female mice in CA3 neurons Sample Title abbreviations: VV = Wild Type, VM = Heterozygous BDNF Val66Met , F = Female, M = Male, FST = acute forced swim stress, Hi = High Estradiol, Lo = Low estradiol, TRAP = Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification
