TITLE
Transcript-specific translational regulation in the unfolded protein response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is characterised in part by the transcriptional induction of genes involved in assisting protein folding. Translational responses to ER stress have been less well described and here we report on a genome-wide analysis of translational regulation in the response to the ER stress-inducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the observed polysome profiles were similar under control and ER stress conditions microarray analysis identified transcipt-specific translational regulation. Genes with functions in ribosomal biogenesis and assembly were translationally repressed under ER stress. In contrast mRNAs for known UPR genes, including the UPR transcription factor HAC1, the ER-oxidoreductase ERO1 and the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) gene DER1 were enriched in polysomal fractions under ER stress conditions. In addition, we show that splicing of HAC1 mRNA is required for efficient ribosomal loading and that Gcn2p is required for normal HAC1 splicing, so shedding light on the role of this protein kinase in the UPR pathway. Keywords: stress response, translational analysis
