TITLE
Array-based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis at 1Mb resolution of 44 pilocytic astrocytomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), WHO Grade I, are one of the most frequently occurring childhood brain tumors. We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) at 1Mb resolution to study copy number changes in a series of PAs (n=44). Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization, aCGH
