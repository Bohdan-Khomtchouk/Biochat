TITLE
Gene expression analysis of zebrafish embryos depleted of arrb1 and/or arrb2 at 12 hpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To comprehensively understand the genes affected by beta-arrestin1 depletion in zebrafish fish embryos at 12 hpf, microarray analysis was performed. As controls, zebrafish embryos depleted of beta-arrestin2 and double depletion of beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin2 were also analyzed.

DESIGN
Briefly, 50 AB/WT zebrafish embryos injected with 4ng control MO, 4ng arrb1 MO, 4ng arrb2 MO and 4ng arrb1+ 4ng arrb2 MO were lyzed in Trizol reagent at 12 hpf. Total RNAs were extracted, and subsequent operation was performed according to Agilent " One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis " protocol, version 5.5.
