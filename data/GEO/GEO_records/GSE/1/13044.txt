TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the lung and liver of low and high dose Perfluorooctanoic Acid exposed mouse fetuses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to PFOA during gestation altered the expression of genes related to fatty acid catabolism in both the fetal liver and lung.  In the fetal liver, the effects of PFOA were robust and also included genes associated with lipid transport, ketogenesis, glucose metabolism, lipoprotein metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, steroid metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis, phospholipid metabolism, retinol metabolism, proteosome activation, and inflammation.  These changes are consistent with activation of PPAR alpha.  Non-PPAR alpha related changes were suggested as well. Keywords: gene expression, microarray,PFOA, mouse, fetus, liver
