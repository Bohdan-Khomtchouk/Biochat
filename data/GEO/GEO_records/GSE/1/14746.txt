TITLE
Identification of HCK and BIN1 as potential mediators of AHI-1 oncogene in primary and transformed CTCL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AHI-1 is an oncogene often targeted by provirus insertional mutagenesis in murine leukemias and lymphomas.  Aberrant expression of human AHI-1 occurs in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells and in CD4+CD7- Sezary cells from patients with Sezary syndrome (SS).  Stable knockdown of AHI-1 using retroviral-mediated RNA interference in CTCL cells inhibits their transforming activity in vitro and in vivo.  To identify genes involved in AHI-1-mediated transformation, microarray analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in AHI-1 suppressed CTCL cells.  Fifteen up-regulated and six down-regulated genes were identified and confirmed by Q-RT-PCR.  Seven were further confirmed in a microarray analysis of CD4+CD7- Sezary cells from SS patients.  HCK and BIN1 emerged as new candidate cooperative genes, with differential protein expression which correlates with observed transcript changes.  Interestingly, changes in HCK phosphorylation and biological response to its inhibitor, dasatinib, were observed in AHI-1 suppressed or overexpressed cells.  The tumor suppressor BIN1 physically interacts with MYC in CTCL cells, which also exhibit differential MYC protein expression.  In addition, aberrant expression of alternative splicing forms of BIN1 was observed in primary and transformed CTCL cells.  These findings indicate that HCK and BIN1 may play critical roles in AHI-1-mediated leukemic transformation of human CTCL cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison
