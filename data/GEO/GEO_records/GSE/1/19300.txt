TITLE
Activation of ER-alpha network in MMTV-Wnt/ILK mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A transgenic mouse model, MMTV-Wnt/ILK, with mammary specific expression of both Wnt-1 and ILK, was generated by crossing the two mouse lines MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-ILK. Affymetrix Mouse Exon chips were hybridized with material from four independent mammary tumors from each MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-Wnt/ILK transgenic model, in order to identify possible signaling differences involved during increased tumor incidence.

DESIGN
One-way ANOVA:  MMTV-Wnt vs. MMTV-Wnt/ILK
