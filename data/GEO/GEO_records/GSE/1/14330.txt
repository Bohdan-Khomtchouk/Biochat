TITLE
Comparison of stable human Treg and Th clones by transcriptional profiling - experiment I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to identify functional features that are specific of human Treg cells, through the identification of genes that are differentially expressed: 1/ in activated Treg clones versus activated Thelper clones; 2/ in Th clones activated in the presence versus the absence of TGFb; 3/ in suppressed Th clones, i.e. Th clones activated in the presence of Treg clones, versus controls. Keywords: TCR activation
