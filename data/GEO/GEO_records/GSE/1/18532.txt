TITLE
Human carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF): co-culture with cancer cells vs. CAF only

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of CAF co-cultured with human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells compared with mono-cultured CAF. To identify key molecular regulators expressed by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that promote cancer cell invasion, microarrays were performed by comparing co-cultured OSCC cells and CAF with monoculture controls.
