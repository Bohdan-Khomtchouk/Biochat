TITLE
The expression profile of Escherichia coli K-12 in response to minimal, optimal and excess copper concentrations

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of E. coli K-12 MG1655 grown in minimal medium supplemented with elevated copper concentrations (as copper-glycine) has been analysed using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays.  “Pool” RNA was isolated from five independently grown 50ml DMA cultures of E. coli K-12 MG1655. “Test” RNA was isolated from three independently grown 50ml DMA cultures of E. coli K-12 MG1655, for each growth condition (no added CuSO4, or supplemented with either 0.75mM or 2mM copper glycine).  A sample of each culture was taken at mid to late exponential growth phase at OD600 0.8 (measured using a Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 2000 in a cuvette with a path length of 10mm). Keywords: dose response
