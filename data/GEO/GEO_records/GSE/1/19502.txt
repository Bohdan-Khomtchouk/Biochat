TITLE
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Differentiation Regulated by a Single Ubiquitin Ligase: Substrate Complex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation is regulated by cell-intrinsic and extrinsic cues. In addition to transcriptional regulation, post-translational regulation may also control HSC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we visualized ubiquitin-regulated protein stability of a single transcription factor, c-Myc. The stability of c-Myc protein was instructive of HSC quiescence and c-Myc protein abundance was controlled by the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Fine changes in stability of c-Myc protein regulated the HSC “gene expression signature”. Using whole genome genomic approaches, we identified specific regulators of HSC function that are directly controlled by c-Myc binding, however adult HSCs and embryonic stem cells sense and interpret distinctly c-Myc regulated gene expression. These studies show a ubiquitin ligase–substrate pair can orchestrate the molecular program of HSC differentiation.
