TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of small intestinal lamina propria Dendritic cells by microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD103+CD11b+ dendritic cells (DC) are unique to the intestine, but the factors governing their differentiation are unclear. Here we show that transforming growth factor receptor 1 (TGF beta 1) has an indispensable, cell intrinsic role in the development of these cells. Deletion of Tgfbr1 results in markedly fewer intestinal CD103+CD11b+ DCs and a reciprocal increase in the CD103–CD11b+ DC subset. Transcriptional profiling identifies markers that define the CD103+CD11b+ DC lineage, including CD101, TREM1 and Siglec-F, and shows that the absence of CD103+CD11b+ DCs in CD11c-Cre.Tgfbr1fl/fl mice reflects defective differentiation from CD103–CD11b+ intermediaries, rather than an isolated loss of CD103 expression. The defect in CD103+CD11b+ DCs is accompanied by reduced generation of antigen-specific, inducible FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in vitro and in vivo, and by reduced numbers of endogenous TH17 cells in the intestinal mucosa. Thus, TGF beta 1 mediated signalling may explain the tissue-specific development of these unique DCs.

DESIGN
Dendritic cell and Macrophage subpopoulations were isolated from the Small Intestine of Healthy Steady State mice, RNA was isolated and sent for microarray analysis
