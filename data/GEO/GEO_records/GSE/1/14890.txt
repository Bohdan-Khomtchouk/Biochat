TITLE
Expression data of LPS-stimulated macrophages from wild-type, MyD88-/- and TRIF-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand, activates intracellular signaling via adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF, leading to the expression of various genes including proinflammatory cytokines. We used microarrays to examine influence of MyD88 or TRIF deficiency in LPS-inducible gene expression. Keywords: Time course after LPS (100 ng/ml) stimulation

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type, MyD88-/- and TRIF-/- mice were stimulated with LPS for 0, 1 and 4 hours, followed by RNA extraction. Then hybridization on affymetrix microarrays was performed.
