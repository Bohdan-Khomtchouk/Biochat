TITLE
Tuber melanosporum gene expression in different tissues

ORGANISM
Tuber melanosporum

SUMMARY
The Transcriptome of different tissues and developmental stages of Tuber melanosporum was analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the French Genoscope - Centre National de Séquençage Tuber melanosporum genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models in various tissues and to use this transcriptional information to confirm, to correct or to reject gene models. Another goal was to identify tissue-specific gene expression, e.g. mycorrhiza up-regulated transcripts or fruiting body up-regulated transcripts for further detailed analyses.
