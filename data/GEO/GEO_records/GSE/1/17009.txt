TITLE
Onconase Responsive Genes in Human Mesothelioma Cells: Implications for an RNA Damaging Therapeutic Agent

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Onconase represents a new class of RNA-damaging drugs. Mechanistically, Onconase is thought to internalize, where it degrades intracellular RNAs such as tRNA and double-stranded RNA, and thereby suppresses protein synthesis.  However, there may be additional or alternative mechanism(s) of action. Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression profiles in untreated human malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines and cells exposed to 5 ug/ml Onconase for 24 h.
