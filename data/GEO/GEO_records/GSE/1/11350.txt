TITLE
Generation of pluripotent stem cells from adult human testis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primordial germ cells and mouse neonatal and adult germline stem cells are pluripotent and derive embryonic stem cell properties. Here we report the successful establishment of stable pluripotent human adult germline stem cells (haGSCs) derived from spermatogonial cells of adult human testis. Cellular and molecular characterization of haGSCs revealed many similarities to human embryonic stem (hES) cells and haGSCs produced teratomas after subcutaneous transplantation into immunodeficient mice. The haGSCs differentiated into various types of somatic cells of all three germ layers when grown under conditions used to induce the differentiation of hES cells. We conclude that the generation of haGSCs from testicular biopsies may provide simple and non-controversial access to individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with hES cells.
