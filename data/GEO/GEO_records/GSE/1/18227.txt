TITLE
DNA methylation data from human iPS cells and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is often inversely correlated with gene expression. We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in 6 iPS cell lines and the fibroblasts from which they were derived.

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from iPS cells and fibroblasts and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
