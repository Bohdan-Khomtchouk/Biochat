TITLE
Expression Profile of CREB knockdown in Myeloid Leukemia Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background.  The cAMP Response Element Binding Protein, CREB, is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in several model systems, including neuronal and hematopoietic cells.  We demonstrated that CREB is overexpressed in acute myeloid and leukemia cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells.  CREB knockdown inhibits leukemic cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, but does not affect long-term hematopoietic reconstitution.  Therefore, we propose CREB to be a potential target for therapy.  To understand downstream pathways regulating CREB, we performed expression profiling with RNA from the K562 myeloid leukemia cell line. Results. By combining our expression data from CREB knockdown cells with prior ChIP data on CREB binding we were able to identify a list of putative CREB regulated genes.  We performed extensive analyses on the top genes in this list as high confidence CREB targets.  We found that this list is enriched for genes involved in cancer, and unexpectedly, highly enriched for histone genes.  Furthermore, histone genes regulated by CREB were more likely to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic lineages.  The transcription factor Elk-1 was upregulated in response to CREB deletion. Conclusions. We have identified a high confidence list of CREB targets in K562 cells.  These genes allow us to begin to understand the mechanisms by which CREB contributes to acute leukemia.  In particular, we speculate that the regulation of histone genes may play an important role in this process, by possibly altering the regulation of DNA replication during the cell cycle.
