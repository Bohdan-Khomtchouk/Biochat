TITLE
Transcription of ectopic DNA in E.coli

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To assess the degree of transcription in E.coli of ectopic DNA from related gamma proteobacteria, we designed a custom NimbleGen array containing highly redundant and substantially complete oligonucleotide probe sets for E. coli, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa annotated genes.  We transformed E. coli, in separate experiments, with individual BAC clones and probed arrays with cDNA derived from DNase treated RNA isolated from the overnight culture of the transformants. Keywords: cross-regulation on genomic scale
