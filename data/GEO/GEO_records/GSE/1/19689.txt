TITLE
QK-knockdown Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- mouse astrocytes transduced with miR-20a or scrambled non-targeting microRNA (miR-NT)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify potential miR-20a regulated mRNAs and linked pathways in the setting of QK knockdown by comparing the transcriptional profiles of shQK-transduced primary mouse Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- astrocytes together with miR-20a or a scrambled miRNA control (miR-NT)

DESIGN
QK-knockdown Ink4a/Arf-/- Pten-/- mouse astrocytes transduced with miR-20a or a scrambled non-targeting microRNA (miR-NT)
