TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type Leishmania species between both stages using full-genome DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analyses of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum intracellular amastigote, and  L. major promastigote compared to L. major intracellular amastigote The full-genome DNA microarray includes one 70mer-oligonucleotide probe for each gene of L. infantum and for each gene of L.major LV39 Keywords: stage-specific comparison
