TITLE
(AKR/J x FVB/NJ)F1 versus (DBA/2J x FVB)F1 bone marrow expression data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
F1 hybrids from (AKR/J x FVB/NJ) and (DBA/2J x FVB/NJ) outcrosses display a 20-fold difference in mammary tumor metastatic capacity, due to differences in inherited polymorphisms.  Expression studies were performed to determine whether polymorphism-driven gene expression signatures predictive of outcome could be generated from normal tissues Keywords: Basal transcription profiles
