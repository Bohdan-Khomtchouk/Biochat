TITLE
Lemon_acidity

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Samples from fruit juice vesicle tissue from three lemon genotypes (Frost Lisbon, Faris " sour " and Faris " sweet " ) differing in fruit acidity were compared at two developmental timepoints (immature, mature). Faris lemon appears to be a graft chimera with the L2 layer derived from normal acid lemon and layer L1 from Millsweet limetta or a closely related genotype. Fruit of Faris sour and Faris sweet grew on different branches of the same tree, with sour fruit developing on branches with L1 and L2 from acid lemon.
