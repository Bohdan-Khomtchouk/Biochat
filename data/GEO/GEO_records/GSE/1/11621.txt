TITLE
Identification of genomic regions regulated by the Xrn1 and Upf1 proteins

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison of WT, xrn1 delta and upf1 delta strains were used in a tiling array to yield genomic regions regulated by these proteins The supplementary CHP files record either the signal in log2 space or the p-values in linear space, per TAS output.  The CHP files are further divided between UPF1 delta vs. WT and XRN1 delta vs. WT.
