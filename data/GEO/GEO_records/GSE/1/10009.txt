Cooperative Signaling Through the STAT3 and NF-kB Pathways in Subtypes of DLBCL

SUMMARY
The activated B cell-like (ABC) subgroup of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the NF-êB pathway. Here we show that the NF- êB pathway induces the expression of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which also have high levels of total and phosphorylated STAT3 protein, suggesting autocrine signaling. Using RNA interference for STAT3, we defined a gene expression signature of IL-6 and IL-10 signaling through STAT3. Based on this signature, we constructed a molecular predictor of STAT3 signaling that defined a subset of ABC DLBCL tumors with high expression of STAT3, IL-6 and/or IL-10, and their downstream targets. Although the STAT3-high and STAT3-low subsets had equivalent expression of genes that distinguish ABC DLBCL from GCB DLBCL, STAT3-high ABC DLBCLs had higher expression of signatures that reflected NF-kB activity, proliferation, and glycolysis. A smallmolecule inhibitor of JAK signaling, which blocked STAT3 signature expression, was toxic only for ABC DLBCL lines, and synergized with an inhibitor of NF-kB signaling. These findings suggest that the biological interplay between the STAT3 and NF-kB pathways may be exploited for the treatments of a subset of ABC DLBCLs. Keywords: time series design
