TITLE
Effect of interferon-gamma on macrophage differentiation and response to Toll-like receptor ligands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of freshly isolated CD14+ human monocytes and monocytes cultured in the presence or absence of interferon (IFN) -gamma for 24 h and then stimulated with Pam3Cys, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand, for 6 h. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which IFN-gamma reprograms early macrophage differentiation and subsequent response to TLR ligands.
