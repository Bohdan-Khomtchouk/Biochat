TITLE
Gene expression after SPVD infection in resistant and susceptible sweet potato cultivars

ORGANISM
Ipomoea batatas

SUMMARY
Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) is one of the most devastating diseases affecting sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas), an important food crop in developing countries. SPVD develops when sweetpotato plants are dually infected with sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV).  In the current study, global gene expression between SPVD affected plants and virus-tested control plants (VT) were compared in the susceptible ‘Beauregard’ and resistant ‘NASPOT 1’ (Nas) sweetpotato cultivars at 5, 9, 13 and 17 days post inoculation (DPI).

DESIGN
Two-color (Cy3 and Cy5) microarrays. 2 cultivars: Beauregard (Bx) and Naspot 1 (Nas); 4 time points: 5dpi, 9dpi, 13 dpi, 17 dpi; Treatments : SPVD and Virus Tested Control; 4 replicates (plants) for each cultivar x treatment combination. Please note that the loop design used for this study necessitated the use of 2 " samples " for each array. So there are 64 sample entries and 32 arrays. Use the title of the supplementary file to determine which samples were hybridized on the same array. For example GSM467650_BNHS1_1.gpr.gz and GSM467651_BNHS1_2.gpr.gz  indicated that GSM467650 and GSM467651 were hybridized on the same array (Lab array # BNHS1).
