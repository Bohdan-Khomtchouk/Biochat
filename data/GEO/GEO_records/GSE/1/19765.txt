TITLE
Transcriptional responses of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - Illumina arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These microarrays were performed for use in a genome-wide scan for LPS-regulated genes in human monocyte-derived macrophages, in order to construct a list of LPS-regulated genes for detailed interrogation on custom microarrays (see GSE19482 for custom array analysis).

DESIGN
Human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) were stimulated with the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, over a time course (0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24h) and analysed in biological duplicate (each of which represents a pool of two independent blood donors), in total representing 4 macrophage preparations from independent blood donors, by commercial Illumina microarray.
