TITLE
Gene expression profiling of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to detect the gene expression profile of in vitro generated dendritic cells , purified monocytes from PBMCs were used as dendritic cell (DCs) precursors and were cultured in medium with cocktail for differentiation and maturation to immature dendritic cells (iDCs) and mature dendritic cells (mDCs). Total RNA samples were isolated from precursor, iDCs and mDCs and used for microarray-based gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
To generate enough amount of immature DC (iDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs), monocytes were differentiated with GM-CSF and rhIL-4 for 2 days and maturated in the presence of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and PGE2 for another 2 days. With the anticipation to insight developmental-stage-specific genes with potential functions related to monocyte derived DCs, global gene expression profiling was set using microarray technology.gene expression profiles were performed in triplicate independent experiments starting for 3 groups of precursor, iDC and mDC generated from different blood donors.
