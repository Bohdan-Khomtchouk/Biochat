ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HLX was found as a VEGF-A induced gene in HUVEC (B.Schweighofer, submitted). In order to detect genes regulated by HLX HUVEC were infected by recombinant adenovirus expressing HLX for 4, 8, 16 and 32h. RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarray.
