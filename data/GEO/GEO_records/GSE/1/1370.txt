Irradiated vs sham irradiated keratynocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CEA_SGF:E00006# This set of experiments was performed in order to identify radiation responsive genes. For this, differentiated cultures derived from a single donor were irradiated at either 1 cGy, 2 Gy or sham-irradiated at T0 and total RNA extracts were prepared at 6 time points post-irradiation. Irradiated samples for each dose were hybridized seperately with sham-irradiated samples at the same time point. Each time point for each individual dose was assessed with two independent dye-swap hybridizations. Keywords: time-course
