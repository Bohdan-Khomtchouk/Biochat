TITLE
preliminary experiment:repetability-Establishing the network of seed gene expression and analysis of its biodiversity

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp3_tri33-arabidoseed - preliminary experiment:repetability - WP3 : Biodiversity of seed traits : state of the art - The third experiment is a comparison of the transcriptome of two parents (Bay0,Sha) and two RILs (104, 140) in loop experimental design. Plants are grown in individual pots on a tray.Flowers were tagged on the flowering day using colored tape. Siliques were harvested 10 days after flowering, freezed in liquid nitrogene and stored at -80degreeC until RNA extraction. Keywords: genotype and ecotype comparison

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
