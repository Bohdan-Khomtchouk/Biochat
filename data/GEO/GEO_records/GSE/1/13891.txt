TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of adult Schistosoma japonicum in response to insulin

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
To define the differential gene regulation of adult Schistosoma japonicum in response to host insulin, we utilised a parasite microarray with 38,444 probes representing 19,222 genes. We cultured male and female adult worms were exposed to insulin and glucose; and then parasites were collected at three time-points. There were 1,437 probes (1101 genes) up or down regulated (Â±1.5 fold change) by insulin after 0.5, 3, 24 hours, with the majority, 712 probes (577 genes) and 623 probes (486 genes) were up-regulated at 24 hour of adding insulin in males and females respectively compared with the control (without insulin).
