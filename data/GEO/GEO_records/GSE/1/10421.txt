TITLE
Liver expression of Bmp6, Smad7, Id1 and Atoh8 is regulated by iron stores

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: Although hepcidin expression was shown to be induced by the BMP signaling pathway, it is not yet known how iron regulates hepcidin and which of the BMP molecules is the endogenous regulator of iron homeostasis in vivo. We therefore assessed liver transcription profiles of mice fed an iron-deficient or an iron-enriched diet and looked for genes that were regulated similarly to hepcidin in that context. Methods: Genome-wide liver expression profiles of mice of the B6 and D2 genetic backgrounds subjected to iron-deficient, -balanced, or -enriched diets were obtained using Agilent Whole Genome microarrays. Real-time quantitative-PCR and western-blots were used to confirm microarray results and compare gene expression variations induced by secondary iron deficiency or iron overload with those consecutive to Smad4 or Hamp1-deficiency. Results: Among 1419 transcripts significantly modulated by the dietary iron content, four were regulated similarly to the hepcidin genes Hamp1 and Hamp2. They are coding for Bmp6, the regulator of Bmp/Smad signal transduction Smad7, the negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins Id1, and a protein with a bHLH domain, Atoh8. The iron overload developed by Smad4 and Hamp1-deficient mice also increased Bmp6 transcription. Body iron stores influence Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and, as shown by analysis of mice with liver-specific disruption of Smad4, the binding partner for the receptor-activated Smads is necessary for activation of Smad7, Id1, and Atoh8 transcription by iron. Conclusions: Liver expression of Bmp6, Smad7, Id1, and Atoh8 is regulated by body iron stores and may participate in hepcidin regulation through the Bmp/Smad pathway.
