TITLE
Integrated bioinformatic and wet-lab approach to identify potential oncogenic networks in neuroblastoma: MEIS1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pediatric tumor neuroblastoma is the second cause of cancer-related death in children. Although several recurrent gene aberrations have been found, the main signaling networks in the neuroblastoma cell, that can give important clues for more specific, more efficient treatment, is still unknown. Here we demonstrate an analysis of the MEIS1 pathway in neuroblastic tumors. It suggests important regulatory connections to tumor differentiation, cell cycle, and cell death.

DESIGN
Time-course experiment of MEIS1-shRNA induction, with 5 timepoints.
