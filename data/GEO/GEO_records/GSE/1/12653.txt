Gene Expression Analysis in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis before/after IL-6 inhibition The obtained conclusions on the change of each gene expression level before and after MRA medication were as follows. (1)	In the case of IL-6, the specific time profile that the expression level dropped at day 21 and increased to some extent at day 42 was observed in 2 of 18 subjects. In other subjects, quite small change or small increase after day 7 was observed. (2)	In the case of IL-6R as well as in IL-6, the specific time profile that the expression level dropped at day 21 and increased to some extent at day 42 was observed in 1 of 18 subjects.  In other subjects, slow and small increase was observed in 6 of 18. (3)	The ratio of mRNA expression level of membrane and soluble type of IL-6R showed marginal difference after tocilizumab treatment, (4)	The distinct change of expression level of cytochrome P450 mRNA after tocilizumab treatment was hardly observed in most patients.
