TITLE
Expression data from healthy smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about alteration of the global gene expression by cigarette smoke (CS) and few biomarkers for smoking-related harm are available. We used Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips to measure the transcriptomes in lymphocytes of 23 current healthy smokers. When heavy smokers were compared with light smokers, 311 genes demonstrated a significant difference in mRNA expression of their blood lymphocytes. Keywords: dose response
