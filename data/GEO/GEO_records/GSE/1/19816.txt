TITLE
Effect of von Willebrand factor on gene expression in HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Von Willebrand factor is a paracrine/autocrine  regulator of human mesenchymal stem cell adhesion to distressed/apoptotic endothelial cells. This data set examines effect of vWF on gene expression in HUVECs.

DESIGN
HUVECs were maintained in EGM2 media and treated with vWF in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS).
