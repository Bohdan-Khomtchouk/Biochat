TITLE
HIC2 regulates maturation of the cardiovascular system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HIC2 is required for normal development of the heart. Loss of function mutants exhibit early embryonic lethality while heterozygous mutants have a partially penetrant ventricular septal defect. The aim of this study was to understand the function of HIC2 in early heart development by identifying potential transcriptional targets. We harvested whole hearts (which contain circulating erythrocytes) at embryonic day E9.5 and compared expression in a conditional loss of function mutant (Mesp1 Cre/+; Hic2 Fl/Fl) to controls (Hic2 Fl/Fl).

DESIGN
All samples represent pools of isolated hearts from E9.5 mouse embryos. 3 replicates of each genotype were assayed. The genotypes are: " WT " : Hic2FL/FL " KO " : Mesp1Cre/+; Hic2 FL/FL
