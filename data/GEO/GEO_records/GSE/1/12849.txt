TITLE
Transcriptome Characterization of Bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Stimulated by LPS

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to identify transcription networks and signatures of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to LPS stimulation.   A total of 464 genes including at least 17 transcription factors were identified to be significantly induced by   LPS using a high density bovine oligonucleotide microarray.  The network analysis revealed that alternation in gene expression was regulated by transcription factors through potential interaction within the pathway networks in the LPS stimulated cells.  Our results demonstrated that specific pathway networks are responsible for transcription regulation in bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to pathogen components such as LPS.
