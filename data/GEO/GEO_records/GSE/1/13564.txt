TITLE
Gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex during postnatal development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fresh frozen post mortem prefrontal cortex tissue (Brodman area 46) was obtained from 44 individuals varying in age from 0 to 49 years. RNA was extracted from these samples and hybridized to HG133plus2.0 GeneChips. The data was used to examine patterns of gene expression over the course of human postnatal developmental and ageing. PMI - postmortem interval, DLPFC - dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
