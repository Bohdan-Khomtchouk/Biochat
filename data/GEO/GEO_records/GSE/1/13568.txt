SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling has been widely used to screen for metastasis-associated genes by comparing the difference in paired primary and metastatic colorectal carcinomas, orthotopic implantation mouse model or cells with different metastatic potential in the field of CRC research In our study, we observed that the genes differentially expressed in M5 relative to its parent SW480 cell line
