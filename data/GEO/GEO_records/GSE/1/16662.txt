TITLE
Expression profiling of in vitro Poplar roots during early interaction with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The early phase of the interaction between tree roots and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, prior to symbiosis establishment, is accompanied by a stimulation of lateral root (LR) development. We set out to identify gene networks that regulate LR development during the early signal exchanges between Populus tremula x Populus alba (hereafter called poplar) and the ECM fungus Laccaria bicolor. A sandwich culture system was developed in order to bring plant and fungus into an indirect contact, which permits signal molecule exchange and LR stimulation (emergence after 4-5 days of contact) but prohibits root colonization. A NimbleGen full genome poplar oligo-array was used to investigate transcript profiles at three days of indirect poplar/L. bicolor contact, referring to the time point of LR initiation in response to the fungus.
