TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the heart stage.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected heart stage seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing heart stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, as well sets of serial sections encompassing the entire heart stage seed.

DESIGN
Heart stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 16 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each; chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, 3 biological replicates each).
