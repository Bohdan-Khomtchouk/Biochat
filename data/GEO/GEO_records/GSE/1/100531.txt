TITLE
Extracellular Vesicles Transfer the Receptor PD-1 in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from cell cultures contain miRNAs associated with T cell co-inhibitory receptors. These are differently regulated in EVs from RA patients and could contribute to the development of a chronic disease.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood (PBMC) and synovial fluid (SFMC) mononuclear cells were cultured from RA patients and HCs. EVs were collected by ultracentrifugation, and the miRNA profile investigated
