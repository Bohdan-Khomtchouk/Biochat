TITLE
FUR- mutant vs. WT

ORGANISM
Salmonella

SUMMARY
Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is the major regulator of iron acquisition in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. In the present study, the role of Fur in anaerobic S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was determined by transcriptome analysis, reporter assays, and enzymatic assays. In anaerobic Δfur, 298 genes were differentially expressed. In general, Fur repressed genes required for iron acquisition/storage, metabolism, electron transport, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and modulators of virulence. There were 73 genes whose expression required Fur, eleven of which contain a putative Fur box 5‟ of the gene. Transcription of sodA was > 9-fold higher in Δfur but there was no corresponding increase in the activity of SodA.
