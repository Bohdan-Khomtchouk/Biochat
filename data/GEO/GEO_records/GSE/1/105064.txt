TITLE
Transcriptomic insights into human decidual and peripheral blood CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the analysis of transcriptional and alternative splicing landscapes for paired decidual and peripheral blood CD8 T cells at the first trimester of human healthy pregnancy by high-throughput mRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Healthy women at the first trimester of pregnancy were recruited, and FACS was performed to isolate and purify the CD8+ T cells from the decidua and maternal peripheral blood. We sequenced the mRNA samples on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
