TITLE
Gata4 and LMO3 balance angiocrine signaling and autocrine inflammatory activation by BMP2 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [HUVEC]

SUMMARY
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) represent a unique, organ-specific type of discontinuous endothelial  cells. LSEC instruct the hepatic vascular niche by paracrine-acting angiocrine factors. Recently, we have shown  that LSEC-specific transcriptional regulator GATA4 induces expression of BMP2 in cultured endothelial cells (EC)  in vitro. Furthermore, angiocrine Bmp2 signaling in the liver in vivo was demonstrated to control iron homeostasis.  Here, we investigated GATA4-dependent autocrine BMP2 signaling in endothelial cells by gene expression  profiling. GATA4 induced a large cluster of inflammatory endothelial response genes in cultured EC, which  is similar to previously identified virus-induced and interferon-associated responses. Treating the cells with the  BMP2 inhibitor Noggin counter-regulated the GATA4-dependent inflammatory phenotype of EC, indicating that  BMP2 is indeed the major driver. In contrast to continuous EC, LSEC were less prone to activation by BMP2.  Notably, GATA4-dependent induction of the inflammatory EC response gene cluster was attenuated by over-expression  of the LSEC-specific transcriptional modifier LMO3 while hepatocyte activation was fully preserved,  indicating conserved BMP2 synthesis. In summary, our data suggest that transcriptional counter-regulation by  GATA4 and LMO3 in LSEC prevents autocrine induction of an inflammatory phenotype, while maintaining angiocrine  BMP2-mediated cell communication in the liver vascular niche.

DESIGN
HUVEC were transduced with human GATA4 or empty vector and stimulated with or without Noggin or BMP2 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
