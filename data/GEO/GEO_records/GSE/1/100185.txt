TITLE
Sirt6 Deficiency Exacerbates Podocyte Injury and Proteinuria through Targeting Notch Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Podocyte injury is a major determinant in proteinuric kidney disease and identification of potential therapeutic targets for preventing podocyte injury has clinical importance. Here, we show that histone deacetylase Sirt6 protects against podocyte injury through epigenetic regulation of Notch signaling. Sirt6 is downregulated in renal biopsies from patients with podocytopathies and its expression negatively correlates withglomerular filtration rate. Podocyte-specific deletion of Sirt6 exacerbates podocyte injury and proteinuria in two independent mouse models including diabetic nephropathy and adriamycin-induced nephropathy. Sirt6 has pleiotropic protective actions in podocytes including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, is involved in actin cytoskeleton maintenance, and promotes autophagy. Sirt6 also reduces urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression, which is a key factor for podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria. Mechanistically, Sirt6 inhibits Notch1 and Notch4 transcription by deacetylating the histone H3K9. We suggest Sirt6 as a potential therapeutic target in proteinuric kidney disease.

DESIGN
Overexpression of Sirt6 by a Sirt6-adenovirus transfection was used in this study. Cells were stimulated with high glucose for 24h (a final concentration of 40 mmol/l in culture medium).
