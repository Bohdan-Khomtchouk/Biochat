TITLE
Generation of pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells, which are capable to generate any cell type of the human body, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) are a very promising source of cells for regenerative medicine. However, the genesis, the in vitro amplification and the differentiation of these cells still need improvement before clinical use. This study aimed to improve our knowledge on these critical steps in pluripotent stem cell generation. We derived new hESC lines, generated hiPS and compared these cell types with human foreskin fibroblasts and partially reprogrammed fibroblasts.
