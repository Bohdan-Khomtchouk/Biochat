TITLE
Comparison of murine colonic mucosal gene expression between postanatal day 90 (P90) to postnatal day 30 (P30)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of murine colonic mucosal gene expression between postanatal day 90 (P90) to postnatal day 30 (P30) by whole genomic expression microarray. Gene expression profiling of colonic mucosal DNA between P90 and P30 mice. Agilent Technologies two-color labelling kit and genomic hybridization protocol was utilized.
