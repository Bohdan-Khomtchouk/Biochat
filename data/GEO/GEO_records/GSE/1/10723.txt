TITLE
Effects of intermittent and chronic hypoxia on HAEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intermittent hypoxia (IH) in HeLa cell culture activates proinflammatory transcription factor NFÎºB, whereas chronic hypoxia (CH) does not.  In order to determine whether IH may be linked to vascular inflammation, we developed a novel IH cell culture system and exposed HAEC (human aortic endothelial cells) to IH or CH. Keywords: Human Artery Endothelial Cells (HAEC)
