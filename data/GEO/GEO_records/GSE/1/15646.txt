TITLE
Kasumi-1 AML1-ETO knockdown samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kasumi-1 AML cells that were transfected in triplicate with AML1-ETO or luciferase siRNA constructs by either Amaxa nucleofection or Biorad siLentFect and incubated for 96 hours. Microarrays used to discover an AML1-ETO signature for a GE-HTS screen to identify AML1-ETO modulators.

DESIGN
Kasumi-1 AML cells incubated for 96 hours after they were transfected in triplicate with AML1-ETO or luciferase siRNA constructs by either Amaxa nucleofection or Biorad siLentFect along with three control samples not transfected with a construct.
