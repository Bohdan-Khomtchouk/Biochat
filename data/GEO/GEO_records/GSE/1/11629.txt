TITLE
Gene expression profiles of four murine tumors after carbon-ion (C-ion) or gamma irradiation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses microarray analysis to examine the fate of multiple C-ion-irradiated tumors in vivo to gain a comprehensive overview of the changes in gene expression induced by C-ion irradiation. Four murine tumors were irradiated in vivo with C-ions at a single dose, and gamma-rays were used as a reference beam. Keywords: mouse squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma,  carbon ion-irradiation, gamma-irradiation, resected sample, transplanted tissues
