TITLE
Positive emotion-specific changes in gene expression profile in hypothalamus of the tickled rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The changes of mRNA expression levels were analyzed in the hypothalamus of the juvenile rat stimulated by tickling for 4 weeks as a positive stimulation. The genes involved in feeding regulation were up-regulated by positive stimulation compared with light-touch stimulation, and the genes related to the stress hormone were down-regulated compared with control (no stimulus). Keywords: Stress response
