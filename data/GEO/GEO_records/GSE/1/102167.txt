TITLE
Plasmodium berghei transcriptome for female gametocytes, male gametocytes, and asexual erythrocytic stages

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei ANKA

SUMMARY
Plasmodium berghei transcriptome for female gametocytes, male gametocytes, and asexual erythrocytic stages

DESIGN
These transcriptomes are derived from isolated female and male gametocytes, and asexual erthythrocytic stages of Plasmodium berghei. Samples are of 820cl1m1cl1 parasites, which express RFP and GFP in female and male gametocytes respectively. Gametocytes were purified by flow cytometry, and asexual stages were derived from mouse blood depleted of host cells by CF11 columns followed by saponin lysis.
