time course uranyl nitrate response-Transcriptomic analysis of uranyl response in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea06-01_uranyl_nitrate - time course uranyl nitrate response - Dynamic analyses of transcriptomic response to urany l nitrate - Plants are grown on sand and transfert in hydroponic culture during 2 days and then expose or not to 50uM uranyl nitrate at pH 4.5 in water or only to water at pH 4.5. Roots and leaves were collected independently after 2h, 6h and 30h of treament. Keywords: organ comparison,time course,treated vs untreated comparison
