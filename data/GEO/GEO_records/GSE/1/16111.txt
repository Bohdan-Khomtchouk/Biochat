TITLE
BMP4 effect on gene expression program in human primary epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BMP signalling is a potent regulator of skin morphogenesis, homeostasis and remodelling. However, molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in regulating gene expression programs in keratinocytes and fibroblasts remain largely unknown. We analyzed the effect of BMP4 tratment on gene expression programs in human primary epidermal keratinocyte and dermal fibroblasts cultures. We identified specific changes in gene expression programs for each cell type.

DESIGN
The primary human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were treated with recombinant BMP4 or solvent control for 8 hours to reveal early and intermediate response genes. The RNA was isolated and used for micro-array analysis.  Changes in gene expression programs were analyzed for each cell type and were compared between cell types.
