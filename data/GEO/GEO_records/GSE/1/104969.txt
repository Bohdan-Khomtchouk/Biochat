TITLE
Time series total RNA sequencing of a differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards trophoblast lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be differentiated towards progeny resembling trophoblast upon exposure to BMP4. Here we analysed transcriptional changes in cells undergoing commitment to trophoblast at 6 time points using total RNA sequencing and identified early and late regulators of trophoblast fate.

DESIGN
hESC cell line H9 was differentiated towards trophoblast lineage using treatment with BMP4. Cells were collected at time points 0 hours (undifferentiated cells), 8 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours and subjected to total RNA sequencing using Illumina platform.
