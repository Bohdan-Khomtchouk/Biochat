TITLE
microRNA expression in lung tumors of viny-carbamate treated and viny-carbamate and indole-3-carbinol treated mice

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We examined the differential expression of miRNAs in vinyl carbamate (VC)-induced lung tumors in A/J mice and assessed if the chemopreventive agent indole-3-carbinol (I3C) reversed the effects of the carcinogen. Microarray studies revealed some up-regulated microRNAs, but down-regulation of several microRNAs in carcinogen-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated mice. Keywords: Expression
