TITLE
Effects of CaMKIV loss on cocaine-induced gene expression in the striatum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ablation of the Camk4 gene in dopaminoceptive neurons of the brain was performed using the Cre/loxP system, with the recombinase expressed from a BAC-derived Drd1a promoter. Our goal was to analyze how loss of CaMKIV will affect acitivity-regulated transcription induced by strong stimulation, i.e. cocaine. Keywords: Treatment x Genotype
