TITLE
Loss-of-function mutations TDRD7 lead to a rare novel syndrome combining congenital cataract and non-obstructive azoospermia in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Comorbid familial non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and congenital cataract (CC) has not been reported previously, and no single human gene has been associated with both diseases in humans. Our purpose is to uncover novel human mutations and genes causing familial NOA and CC.  Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing for two brothers with both NOA and CC from a consanguineous family.The proband was also carried out SNP array analysis. Mutation screening of TDRD7 was performed in another similar consanguineous family and 176 patients with azoospermia or CC alone and 520 healthy controls. Histological analysis was performed for the biopsied testicle sample in one patient, and knockout mice were constructed to verify the phenotype of the mutation in TDRD7.   Results: Two novel loss-of-function mutations (c.324_325insA (T110Nfs*30) and (c.688-689insA (p.Y230X), respectively) of TDRD7 were found in the affected patients from the two unrelated consanguineous families. Histological analysis demonstrated a lack of mature sperm in the male patientâ€™s seminiferous tubules. The mutations were not detected in patients with CC or NOA alone. Mice with Tdrd7 gene disrupted at a similar position precisely replicated the human syndrome.   Conclusions: We identified TDRD7 causing CC as a new pathogenic gene for male azoospermia in human, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples.
