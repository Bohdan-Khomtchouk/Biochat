TITLE
MKL1 promotes megakaryocytic differentiation in HEL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Megakaryoblastic Leukemia 1 (MKL1) was identified as part of the t(1;22) translocation specific to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, but nothing is known regarding its role in hematopoiesis. Here we show that overexpression of MKL1 enhances megakaryocytic differentiation of the Human Erythroleukemia cell line (HEL). Microarray analysis reveals that MKL1 promotes expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes such as glycoprotein V (GP5), as well as cytoskeletal and adhesion molecule genes relevant to megakaryocyte differentiation and proplatelet formation. MKL1 is a transcriptional coactivator of Serum Response Factor. In this study, MKL1 also upregulates known SRF targets. Results provide insight into the role of MKL1 in megakaryocytopoiesis.
