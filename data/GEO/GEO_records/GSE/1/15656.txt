TITLE
Expression data from synchronized L4 C. elegans during starvation

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle associated with lipid metabolism. However, the involvement of the ER in nutritional status-dependent energy homeostasis is largely unknown. The results of this study demonstrate that IRE-1, an ER protein known to be involved in the unfolded protein response, and HSP-4, an ER chaperone, regulate expression of the novel fasting-induced lipases FIL-1 and FIL-2, which induce fat granule hydrolysis upon fasting in C. elegans. RNAi  and ectopic expression experiments demostrated that FIL-1 and FIL-2 are both necessary and sufficient for fasting-induced fat granule breakdown. Failure of ire-1 and hsp-4 mutant animals to hydrolyze fat granules during starvation impaired their motility, which was rescued by glucose supplementation of their media, implicating the importance of ire-1/hsp-4-dependent lipolysis for energy supply from stored fat during fasting. Taken together, these data suggest that the ER-resident proteins IRE-1 and HSP-4 are key nutritional sensors that modulate expression of inducible lipases to maintain whole-body energy homeostasis in C. elegans.

DESIGN
Synchronized L4 worms were divided into well-fed and 6 hours fasted samples for RNA extraction and hybridization on an Agilent microarray.
