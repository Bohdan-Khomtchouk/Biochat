TITLE
Molecular Basis of Infrared Detection by Snakes

ORGANISM
Crotalus atrox

SUMMARY
Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a ‘thermal image’ of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibers of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 as the infrared receptor on sensory neurons that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 from pit bearing snakes (rattlesnakes and pythons) are the most heat sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli in these animals. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of TRP channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.

DESIGN
Gene expression measurements implicate TRPA1 as the heat-sensitive channel in diverse pit snakes
