TITLE
Microarray profile of osteoporosis related genes of Indian post menopausal females

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease with genetic and strong epigenetic component. In spite of enormous candidate gene association studies, the etiology and molecular mechanism of disease is not fully known. This study is undertaken to identify new markers of osteoporosis which could be vital in diagnosis and prognosis of disease, genome-wide microarray expression approach was employed on post menopausal Indian females living in same geographical area with almost similar life-style. To validate microarray gene expression pattern, qRT-PCR was performed on top 5 genes on osteoporotic (n =32) and non-osteoporotic (n=15) post menopausal females

DESIGN
Osteoclast precursor cells were sorted from circulating monocytes of osteoporotic (n=4) and non-osteoporotic (n=4) post menopausal Asian Indian females with similar life-style and age after menopause.
