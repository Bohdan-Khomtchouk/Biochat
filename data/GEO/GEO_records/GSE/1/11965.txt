Contribution of HSD17B12 for estradiol biosynthesis in human breast cancer

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type12 (HSD17B12) has been demonstrated to be involved in regulation of in situ biosynthesis of estradiol (E2). HSD17B12 expression was reported in breast carcinomas but its functions have remained unknown. Therefore, we examined the correlation between mRNA expression profiles determined by microarray analysis and tissue E2 concentrations obtained from 16 postmenopausal breast carcinoma cases in order to analyze an association of the enzyme expression with intratumoral E2 production. No significant correlations were detected between intratumoral HSD17B12expression and E2 concentration.These findings suggest that the presence of HSD17B12 in carcinoma cells contributes to a development of human breast carcinoma via a pathway other than in situ E2 biosynthesis.
