TITLE
Time-course gene expression profiles of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type and long-lived sch9-delta mutant

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The SCH9 null strain has smaller cell size, grows at a slower rate and survives three times longer than wide-type yeast. This study aims to dissect the mechanisms that lead to the yeast life span extension of  sch9-delta.
