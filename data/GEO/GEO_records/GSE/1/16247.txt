TITLE
Thioxotriazole copper(II) complex A0 kills cancer cells inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and paraptotic cell death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-course experiment for gene expression profiling of HT1080 cells showed that while cisplatin induced p53 targets, A0 regulates genes involved in response to heavy metals or to unfolded protein, supporting the absence of relation between sensitivities to the two drugs Keywords: Time-course Experiment

DESIGN
Expression Profile Comparison of HT1080 in response to A0 and Cisplatin in a Time-course Experiment Design
