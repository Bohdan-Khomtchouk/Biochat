TITLE
Human variation in PolII and NF-KappaB binding (ChIP-seq study with NF-KappaB)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined genome-wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The binding sites of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) as well as a key regulator of immune responses, NFkB, were mapped in ten HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from individuals of African, European, and Asian ancestry, including a parent-offspring trio. We also mapped gene expression in all ten human cell lines for two treatment conditions: a) no treatment and b) following induction by TNF-alpha.
