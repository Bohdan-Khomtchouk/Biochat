Expression of Wnt Receptors in Adult Spiral Ganglion Neurons: Fzd 9 Located at Growth Cones of Regenerating Neurites

SUMMARY
The fidelity of sound transmission by cochlear implants in patients with sensorineural hearing loss could be greatly improved by increasing the number of frequency channels. This could be achieved by stimulating and guiding neurite outgrowth to reduce the distance between the implant's electrodes and the remnants of the spiral ganglion neurons. However, little is known about signaling pathways, besides those of neurotrophic factors, that are operational in the adult spiral ganglion. To systematically identify neuronal receptors for guidance cues in the adult cochlea, we conducted a genome-wide cDNA microarray screen with two-month-old CBA/CaJ mice. A meta-analysis of our data and those from older mice in two other studies revealed the presence of neuronal transmembrane receptors that represent all four established guidance pathways—ephrin, netrin, semaphorin, and slit—in the mature cochlea as late as 15 months. In addition, we observed the expression of all known receptors for the Wnt morphogens, whose neuronal guidance function has only recently been recognized. In situ hybridizations located the mRNAs of the Wnt receptors frizzled 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 specifically in adult spiral ganglion neurons. Finally, frizzled 9 protein was found in the growth cones of adult spiral ganglion neurons that were regenerating neurites in culture. We conclude from our results that adult spiral ganglion neurons are poised to respond to neurite damage, owing to the constitutive expression of a large and diverse collection of guidance receptors. Wnt signaling, in particular, emerges as a candidate pathway for guiding neurite outgrowth towards a cochlear implant after sensorineural hearing loss.
