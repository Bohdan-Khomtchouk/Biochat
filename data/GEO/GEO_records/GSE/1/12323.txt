TITLE
NaphS2 Gene Expression During Anaerobic Degradation of Naphthalene

ORGANISM
delta proteobacterium NaphS2

SUMMARY
Degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as naphthalene by anaerobic microorganisms is poorly understood.  Strain NaphS2, an anaerobic sulfate reducing marine delta-proteobacterium is capable of using naphthalene and the aromatic compound benzoate, as well as pyruvate, as an electron donors in the presence of sulfate. In order to identify genes involved in the naphthalene degradation pathway, we compared gene expression in NaphS2 during growth on benzoate vs. pyruvate, naphthalene vs. pyruvate, and naphthalene vs benzoate.
