TITLE
Determination of variability of fermentor-grown Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88

SUMMARY
Knowledge of the biological and technical variation for fermentor-grown Aspergillus niger cultures is needed to design DNA microarray experiments properly. We cultured A. niger in batch-operated fermentor vessels and induced with D-xylose. Transcript profiles were followed in detail by qPCR for 8 genes. A variance components analysis was performed on these data to determine the origin and magnitude of variation within each process step for this experiment. 6 Fermentor cultures were selected to determine technical and biological variation for all 14554 ORFs present on this array type. Keywords: Validation of microarrays; variation analysis; experimental design
