TITLE
Placental and decidual timecourse samples normalized and modeled with an undissected e17 sample

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used full genome microarrays to profile the full lifetime of the mouse placenta from embryonic day 8.5 (e8.5), at the time of chorioallantoic fusion, until postnatal day 0 (P0).  For these samples, at each stage the fetal placenta and maternal decidual tissues were dissected and profiled separately (See series 1). For this experiment (Series 2), placental and decidual timecourse samples were normalized and modeled with two undissected (including placental and decidual tissue) e17 placentas to allow for scaling of values for comparison to the undissected placenta samples used in the publicly available mouse GeneAtlas dataset Keywords: time course
