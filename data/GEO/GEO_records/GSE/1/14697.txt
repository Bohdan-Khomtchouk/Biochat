TITLE
Freeze resistance basis of winter wheat mutant lines

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Two azide mutagenized lines Freeze Resistance (FR, 75% survival) and Freeze Susceptible (FS, 30% survival) were compared with and without 4°C ± 1.5 cold acclimation of crown tissue to identify genes responsible for the difference in freeze resistance. Keywords: Wheat cold acclimation, stress response, cold, low temperature

DESIGN
Experiment design (8 hybridizations): Genotype: SD16029 (FR) or SD16169 (FS) Temperature: 25°C or 4°C
