TITLE
Within and between-species transcript profiling during cotton fibre development

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiling study on two major cotton species that are cultivated for fibre, Gossypium hirsutum (L.) and Gossypium barbadense (L.), at different stages during fibre development using a printed cDNA microarray was undertaken to identify potential candidate genes for manipulation to improve fibre quality. Keywords: Species comparison, development
