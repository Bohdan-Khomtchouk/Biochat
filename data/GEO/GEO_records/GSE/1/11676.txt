TITLE
Gene expression variations caused by dietary changes in methy-donor content

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we adapted and tested the applicability of Methylation Specific Digital Karyotyping (MSDK), a non-array based method, for the prospective analysis of epigenetic changes after perinatal nutritional modifications in a mouse model of allergic airway disease. As part of the same study we also analyzed the gene expression profiles by SAGE.
