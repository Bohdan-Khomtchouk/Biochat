TITLE
Expression data using esophageal epithelia from 3 month old-mice lacking the transcription factor Klf4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using the ED-L2 promoter of Epstein-Barr virus to drive Cre, we obtained tissue specific ablation of Klf4 in the squamous epithelia of the esophagus. Using a functional genomic approach, we showed decreased expression of critical late-stage differentiation factors and identified alterations of several genes important in cellular differentiation.
