TITLE
C. elegans small RNAs

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
High throughput sequencing to derive function of cde-1 in endogenous RNAi in C. elegans

DESIGN
Small RNAs were cloned from C. elegans adults, following removal of tri-phosphate groups from 5' end. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina 1G platform.
