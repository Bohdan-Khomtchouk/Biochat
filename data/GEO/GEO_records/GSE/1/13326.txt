TITLE
Microarray for suspension cells of PA14 WT with and without NE (50 uM and 500 uM) for 7 h

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
It has been proposed that the gastro-intestinal tract environment containing high levels of neuroendocrine hormones is important for gut-derived P. aeruginosa infections. In this study, we report that the hormone norepinephrine increases P. aeruginosa PA14 growth, virulence factor production, invasion of HCT-8 epithelial cells, and swimming motility in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis of P. aeruginosa exposed to 500 µM, but not 50 µM, norepinephrine for 7 h showed that genes involved in the regulation of the virulence determinants pyocyanin, elastase, and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone) were up-regulated. The production of rhamnolipids, which are also important in P. aeruginosa infections, was significantly decreased on semi-solid surfaces, but not in planktonic cultures, upon exposure to norepinephrine. Swarming motility, a phenotype that is directly influenced by rhamnolipids, was also decreased upon 500 µM norepinephrine exposure. The increase in the transcriptional activation of lasR, but not that of rhlR, suggest that the effects of norepinephrine are mediated primarily through the las quorum sensing pathway. Together, our data strongly suggests that norepinephrine can play an important role in gut-derived infections by increasing the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa PA14.
