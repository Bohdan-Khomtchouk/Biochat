SUMMARY
Alterations in gene expression in FVB/NJ mouse liver following 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) treatment for 32 weeks. Mice were treated with 45 mg/kg/day 4-NP for 32 weeks, livers excised and differential gene expression determined. Samples 1 and 2 are controls and samples 3 and 4 are mice treated with 4-NP. Arrays were visualized from the K-screen, and analyzed and quantified with a phosphoimager (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the ResGen PathwaysTM Universal Microarray Analysis SoftwareTM (Research Genetics, Carlsbad, CA).  Local background was subtracted automatically from the individual spot intensities, and spot intensities were normalized to the mean intensity of all spots on the array.  This is called datapoint normalization on the ResGen Pathways Microarray Analysis SoftwareTM.  Normalized gene intensities on the arrays probed with 4-NP treated mouse livers and untreated mouse liver cDNA were compared, and fold differences were calculated. Keywords: ordered
