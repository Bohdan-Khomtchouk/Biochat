TITLE
Expression data on APM effect in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To seek whether seasonal variation in environmental particulate matter composition affected the global gene response patterns in cultured human cells representing pulmonary and systemic vascular targets. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression affected on different cells type by different seasonal collections of Ambient Particulate Matter.

DESIGN
After treatment with 10 ug/mL either summer2006 or winter2007APM, endothelial or bronchail epithelial cells were isolated by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the genes responses correlated with current concepts of systemic inflammation in cardiovascular effects of particulate air pollution.
