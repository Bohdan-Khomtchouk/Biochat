TITLE
An integrative multi-dimensional genetic and epigenetic strategy to identify aberrant genes and pathways in cancer: DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation profiles of a panel of breast cancer lines that were included in the integrative analysis of DNA copy number, allelic status, DNA methylation and gene expression.

DESIGN
Methylation profiles of 9 breast cancer cell lines and one normal line were generated.  Genes were determined to be hyper and hypomethylation in a cell line with respect to the normal line, MCF10A.
