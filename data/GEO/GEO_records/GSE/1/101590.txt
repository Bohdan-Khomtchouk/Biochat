TITLE
RXR mediated neurogenesis (RNA-Seq I)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A growing number of pieces of evidence suggest the importance of Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)-mediated pathways in neurogenesis and the dysregulation of this signaling in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer`s or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The data presented here identify the RAR:RXR and LXR:RXR-mediated transcriptional program in embryonic stem cells, neural progenitors and terminally differentiated neurons.

DESIGN
ATRA treatment
