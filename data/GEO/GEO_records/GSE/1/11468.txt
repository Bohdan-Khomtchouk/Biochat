TITLE
Molecular Profiling of Small and Large Retinal Ganglion Cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Different sub-types of ganglion cells existing in mammalian retinas possessing distinct function in processing the visual information. In primates, RGC are commonly divided into midget cells, which are relatively small, and parasol cells, with a larger soma size. Rodents also possess morphologically distinct populations, but their physiological properties are less characterized. The two types of mammalian RGCs differ in their response to pathological conditions such as retinal ischemia, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. In this work, we compared gene expression profiles of large (LRGCs) and small (SRGCs) ganglion cells isolated from rat retina in attempt to identify molecular determinants underlying differences in function and tolerance to stress. Keywords: comparative hybridization
