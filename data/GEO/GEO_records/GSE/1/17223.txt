Populus sp.

SUMMARY
affy_popsec_nancy_roots_poplar - This project aims to identify genes of interest for water deficit acclimation and/or adaptation in a tree species: poplar. We look for genes and gene expression networks related to drought stress. We intend to analyse the transcriptome in root apices, in two genotypes, Carpaccio and Soligo, at various stages and intensities of stress. Root apex is the location of root elongation and these analyses intend to identify genes involved in the control of cell expansion and thus of root elongation. Indeed, root growth maintenance in response to water shortage contributes to plant tolerance to water deficit. The comparison between medium and severe stress intensities and between early and long term stresses will power the selection of genes of interest. The co-analysis of two genotypes of contrasted tolerance to water deficit should help to better discriminate genes presenting a potential adaptative character from genes responding passively to the constraint.-Two poplar clones, Soligo (S) and Carpacio (C) were submitted to 4 treatments: control, mild water deficit, moderate water deficit (12-day long for both) and early-drought stress (about 36-h long). Growth and physiology was characterised on a batch of plants and samples collected on another batch of plants. Four to eight root apices (1Â cm-long) were collected on each individual tree. Total RNAs were extracted from all roots for each tree individually. Two pools of 3 (or 2) individuals were made using equimolar ratio. A pool is considered as one biological replicate and corresponds to one Affymetrix slide. The two biological replicates originate from the same experiment. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
