TITLE
Rat heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat somatic heart cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave the rat somatic heart cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the rat iPS cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between rat somatic heart cells and rat iPS cells.
