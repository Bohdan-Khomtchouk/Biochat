TITLE
Genomic Response of Escherichia coli during coexpression of a bacteriocin release protein

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Secretion of recombinant proteins to the culture medium after transport to the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria often facilitates downstream-processing. It could lead to more biological active and correct folded proteins and low contamination with host proteins, thereby reducing the costs of the production process. However, Escherichia coli K12 secrets only little amount and few substrates naturally. This is one of the major drawbacks for the applicability of this strain in the biotechnology industry, when large amounts of biological active proteins are desirable. Therefore, different attempts were made to enhance the level of secreted proteins. Coexpression of bacteriocin release proteins makes the outer membrane permeable for proteins. A detailed insight into the complex underlying regulatory mechanism and metabolic changes when such release proteins are expressed could be very useful for successful optimisation strategies. The identification of potential optimisation targets can be achieved by DNA-microarray-technology, as proven in many cases before. In this work DNA-microarrays were used for the identification of differentially expressed genes of an inducible E.coli secretion strain expressing reporter proteins bacterial alkaline phosphatase, PhoA and beta-lactamase, Bla and their release to the culture medium by coexpression of the BRP of CloDF13. Based on the data of whole genome experiments and on the different databases genes which are regulated after induction of BRP expression are identified and discussed. BRP activity was found to cause a substantial cellular response and considerable changes in global gene expression. Additionally, performed cluster-analysis using k-means algorithm identified clusters containing promising candidates for new optimisation strategies aiming for an enhanced protein secretion.
