SUMMARY
Mutant maize lines expressing RNAi gene silencing constructs directed to two distinct classes of chromatin associated proteins show heightened sensitivity to UV-B including sunburned necrosis and down regulation of chromatin genes (Casati and Walbot, 2006).  We have available transgenic maize expressing an RNAi for these chromatin factors: a subunit of a chromatin remodeling complex R, which is a SWI2/SNF2-like protein containing a SNF2 N and a helicase C domain (CHC101, AI746001); and a methyl-CpG-binding protein (MDB101, AI737448). To better understand the processes that involve chromatin remodeling proteins in UV-B responses, we conducted transcriptome analysis of chromatin remodeling knockdown plants in under two radiation regimes:  plants were illuminated with UV-B lamps using fixtures mounted 30 cm above the plants (Phillips, F40UVB 40 W and TL 20 W/12) for 8 h; leaf samples were collected immediately after the radiation treatment. The bulbs were covered with CA filters to exclude wavelengths lower than 280 nm (UV-B). As a control, the bulbs were covered with PE filters to exclude wavelengths lower than 320 nm (minus UV-B).  We analyzed genes that are changed upon UV-B irradiation in the transgenic plants and compared to the responses in non transgenic plants. To differentiate between differences due to background specific genes expression, we used non-transgenic sibling as controls. For these experiments, we used Long oligonucleotides arrays from Agilent Technologies.  These studies will help to dilucidate how alteration in chromatin remodeling protein proteins affect gene expression, and the transcriptome analysis will help to understand why transgenic plants are hypersensity to UV-B. Keywords: genetic modification-stress response
