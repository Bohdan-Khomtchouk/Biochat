TITLE
Expression profiling of activated or control 5-FU bone marrow from MLL-AF4stop knockin mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We created a mouse model where conditional expression of physiologic levels of an Mll-AF4 fusion oncogene induces development of acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Immunophenotypic and gene expression analysis of the ALL cells demonstrated bone marrow replacement with B-precursor cells which express a gene expression profile that has significant overlap with profiles in human MLL-rearranged ALL. To examine early, pre-leukemic changes in lymphoid cells due to Mll-AF4 expression, we infected 5-FU bone marrow cells from Mll-AF4stop knocking mice with activating (Cre-GFP) or control (MIF-GFP) retrovirus ex vivo and measured expression changes after culture under lymphoid growth conditions. Keywords: Cell type comparison
