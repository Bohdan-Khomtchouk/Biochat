TITLE
GBM and microglia fraction of same glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the immune performance and interactions of CNS microglia/macrophages in glioma patients. Microglia/macrophages were found to be the predominant immune cell infiltrating gliomas (approximately 1% of total cells); others identified are myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and T cells. Using a procedure enriching for CD11b/c+CD45+ glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages (GIMs) from postoperative tissue specimens of glioma patients (Hussain et al. Neuro Oncol. 2006 J;8(3):261-79) gene expression profiles were obtained form paired samples. The expression profiles are used to identify expression signatures contributed by GIMs in glioblastoma data sets (Murat et al, submitted).

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of a set of paired samples consisting of glioblastoma and the respective GIM fraction from the same male patient.
