TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated genomic fragments from tumor DNA and matching normal control were enriched with the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA); amplified, labeled and hybridized on Agilent CpG island tiling oligo arrays. MIRA enriched samples from tumor were labeled with Cy5 while MIRA enriched DNA samples from normal tissue were labeled with Cy3. Keywords: Cancer

DESIGN
Methylation patterns of tumors; six patients with early stage breast cancer (DCIS)
