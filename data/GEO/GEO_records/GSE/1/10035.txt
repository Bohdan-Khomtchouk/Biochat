SUMMARY
Combination of reverse- and chemical genetic screens reveals a network of novel angiogenesis inhibitors and targets    Drug target identification and validation are bottlenecks in the drug discovery process. Accordingly there is a need to develop new methods to facilitate the development of much-needed innovative drugs. We have combined reverse- and chemical genetics to identify new targets modulating blood vessel development. Through mRNA expression profiling in mice we identified 155 drugable gene products that were enriched in the microvasculature. Orthologs of 50 of these candidates were knocked down in a reverse genetic screen in zebrafish. 16 of the 50 genes encoded products that affected angiogenesis. In parallel, screening of 300 known drugs and pharmacologically active compounds in a human cell-based angiogenesis assay identified 11 angiogenesis inhibitors. Strikingly the reverse- and chemical genetic screens identified an overlap of three gene products of the same superfamily of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and two compounds targeting that family. Furthermore, the gene products identified in the reverse genetic screen comprise an interacting network with the targets of the chemical genetic screen. Thus, combining reverse- and chemical genetic screens is a powerful approach to identify novel biological processes and drug targets in vertebrates. Keywords: Cell-type comparison
