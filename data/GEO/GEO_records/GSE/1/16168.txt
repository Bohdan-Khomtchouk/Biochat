TITLE
Expression Profile of Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Serotonin Neurons

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The rhesus embryonic stem cell line 366.4 differentiates into serotonin neurons. RNA was extracted from ESC colonies, embryoid body (Ebs), Neurospheres in selection (N1), Proliferating serotonin neurons (N2) and differentiating serotonin neurons (N3). RNA was labeled with Enzo biotin labelling kit and hybridized to Rhesus chip from Affymetrix.

DESIGN
single sample represent each stages and total 5 rhesus chip were hybridized
