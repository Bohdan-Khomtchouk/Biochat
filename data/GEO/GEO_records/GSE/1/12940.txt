TITLE
Whole Genome Segregation of light and nitrate effect in rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The current study aimed at segregating the light and nitrate effect in rice plants (Oryza sativa indica). The primary aim of the study was to demarcate the genes that were purely regulated by light and nitrate. A separate list of genes that were co-regulated by these two signals would provide insights into the exact mode of regulation of primary metabolic pathways.
