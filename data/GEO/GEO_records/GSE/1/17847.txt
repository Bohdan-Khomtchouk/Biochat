TITLE
Ethanol stress response in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiles of control Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 cells were compared with 8% ethanol adapted cells and with 10 min or 30 min 8% ethanol shocked cells.

DESIGN
A continuous culture was performed in duplicate on medium containing ehtanol (tE). A shock experiment was performed in duplicate in which ethanol was added to a batch culture immediately after t0 (=control). The culture was sampled at time=0 (t0), time =10 min (t1) and time=30 min (t2).
