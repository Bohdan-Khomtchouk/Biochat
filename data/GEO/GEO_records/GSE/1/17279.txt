TITLE
Kc167 Replication Timing

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_668 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: The relative time of replication for all unique sequences in the Drosophila genome was determined by synchronizing tissue culture cell and differentially labeling early and late replicating intermediates. The differentially labeled replication intermediates were then hybridized to Agilent genomic tiling arrays to identify early and late replicating domains.
