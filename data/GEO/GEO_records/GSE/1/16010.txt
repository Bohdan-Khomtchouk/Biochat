TITLE
Use of CGH microarrays to identify strain variable genomic regions in C. botulinum ATCC 3502

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization microarrays featuring overlapping probes spanning the entire C. botulinum type A1 strain ATCC 3502 genome were used to identify regions whose presence are variable among a diverse panel of type A C. botulinum strains.
