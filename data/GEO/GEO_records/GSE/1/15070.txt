TITLE
Expression Profiles of 15(S)-HETE treated RAW 264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hemozoin phagocytosis results in immunomodulation. This study was designed to explore gene expression responses to 15(S)-HETE in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment type. Each replicate was composed of 6 pooled wells from a 6-well plate.
