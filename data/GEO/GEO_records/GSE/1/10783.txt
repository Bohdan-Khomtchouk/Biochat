TITLE
Validation Set for Prediction of Outcome in Adult Male Germ Cell Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series represents expression profiles of 34 non-seminoma germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) from patients who received cisplatin based chemotherarpy for treatment of their disease for whom full clinical follow-up information was available. These specimens were used as a validation set to test outcome prediction models using a subset of previously profiled GCT specimens (see GEO accession #GSE3218). Keywords: Disease state analysis (good vs. poor patient outcome)
