TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma derived sphere lines, adherent cell lines and their original glioblastoma tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) derived sphere lines and adherent cell lines are an important tool for research in basic and translational neuro-oncology. Documentation of their genetic identity has become a requirement for scientific journals and grant applications to exclude cross-contamination and misidentification that lead to misinterpretation of results. Here, we report expression data for 26 samples including 4 GBM derived sphere lines (4 x 3 replicates), 2 GBM derived sphere lines passaged through intracranial  transplantation (2x 1), 2 adherent GBM derived cell lines (2 + 2 x 3 replicates), 4 corresponding glioblastoma tumors and 2 non-tumor brain tissues.
