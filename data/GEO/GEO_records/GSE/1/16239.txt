TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-181c

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found frequently down-regulation of microRNA-181c in human gastric cancer cases. To identify the potential target of miR-181c, we introduced miR-181c into a gastric cancer cell line KATO-III　and analyzed significant changes of gene expression which was induced after introducing miR-181c. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
KATO-III cells were transfected with Precursor Molecule mimicking miR-181c (Ambion) or mock.  Precursor Molecules were gave a final concentration of 100 nmol/L by using MicroPorator MP-100 (Digital BioTechnology, Seoul, Korea), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested for cDNA microarray analysis.
