TITLE
High succinic acid tolerance E.coli (DST160)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To understand cell responses against high succinate stress, a continuous culture was performed for 9 months using a wild Escherichia coli under gradually increasing succinate stress. The final adapted strain against high succinate stress, named DST160, was able to grow with no lag phase in medium containing 1.35 M of succinate stress while wild W3110 showed more than 38 h lag phase. The maximum growth rate and growth yield of DST160 under the stress condition were 0.20 h-1 and 0.192 g-cell/g-glucose, which were 53.8 % and 12.3 % higher than those of W3110 (0.13 h-1 and 0.171 g-cell/g-glucose, respectively).
