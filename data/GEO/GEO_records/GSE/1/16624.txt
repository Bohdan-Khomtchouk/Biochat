TITLE
Expression data from lungs of rats with pulmonary hypertension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pulmonary hypertension is a frequent consequence of left heart disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) and causes extensive lung vascular remodelling which leads to right ventricular failure. Functional genomics underlying this structural remodelling are unknown but present potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Control rat lung samples were compared to samples of aortic banding rat lungs which exhibit pulmonary hypertension
