TITLE
Microarray analysis of a hybrid weakness in the cross between rice cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To study a hybrid weakness of rice, we have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes increased or decreased their expression specifically in the hybrid. Expression profiles of ‘Nipponbare’, ‘Jamaica’, and F1 hybrid were analyzed with ‘Rice oligo microarray kit’ of Agilent Technologies.
