TITLE
Loss of tight junction integrity induces loss of epithelial phenotype: case of Claudin11 knock out in testis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelium barrier integrity is assumed at least in part by the presence of junctions between cells. Tight-junction formation may be necessary for Sertoli cells to cease dividing and to support germ cell development. Microarray analysis of P20 Cldn11 +/- and Cldn11-/- testes confirmed the impact od Cldn11 deficiency on cell cytoskeleton and junction-related genes. Keywords: transcriptomic analysis
