TITLE
Gene expression data from non-malignant fallopian tube epithelium and high grade serous carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify molecular alterations potentially involved in predisposition to adnexal serous carcinoma (SerCa) in the non-malignant fallopian tube epithelium   (FTE) of BRCA1/2-mutation carriers, given recent evidence implicating the distal FTE as a common source for SerCa. Keywords: disease state analysis
