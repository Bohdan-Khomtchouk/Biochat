TITLE
miRNA profiles of adipocyte-derived microvesicles (ADMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiles of adipocyte-derived microvesicles (ADMs) on the Day 2-4 and Day 8-10 were compared.

DESIGN
ADMs were prepared from the 48h-conditioned medium of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Day 2-4 and Day 8-10) followed by RNA isolation.
