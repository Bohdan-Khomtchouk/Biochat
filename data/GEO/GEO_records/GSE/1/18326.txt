TITLE
Role of FoxO3 in adult neural stem cell maintenance in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the nervous system, neural stem cells (NSC) are necessary for the generation of new neurons and for cognitive function. Here we show that FoxO3, a member of a transcription factor family known to extend lifespan in invertebrates, regulates the NSC pool. We find that adult FoxO3-/- mice have fewer NSC in vivo than wild type counterparts. NSC isolated from adult FoxO3-/- mice have decreased self-renewal and an impaired ability to generate different neural lineages. Identification of the FoxO3-dependent gene expression profile in NSC suggests that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool by inducing a program of genes that preserves quiescence, prevents premature differentiation, and controls oxygen metabolism. The ability of FoxO3 to prevent the premature depletion of NSC might have important implications for counteracting brain aging in long-lived species.

DESIGN
mRNA expression from secondary neurospheres cultured from cells taken from mouse forebrains was compared between FoxO3+/+ (wildtype) and FoxO3-/- (null mutant) mice from the FVB/N background.
