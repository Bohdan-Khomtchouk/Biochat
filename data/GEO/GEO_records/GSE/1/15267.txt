TITLE
Expression data of induced pluripotent stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We present a robust serum-free system for the rapid and efficient reprogramming of mouse somatic cells by Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4.  The elimination of fetal bovine serum and oncogene c-Myc allowed reprogramming cells to be detected as early as Day 2 and reached greater than 10% of the population at Day 7 post retroviral transduction. The resulting iPS colonies were isolated with high efficiency to establish pluripotent cell lines. Based on this method, we further developed iPS-SF1 as a dedicated reprogramming medium for chemical screening and mechanistic investigations. Comparasion of iPS cell lines derived from serum-free culture condition, MEF cells cultured in serum and serum-free condition and ES cell lines was shown.

DESIGN
Selected induced pluripotent stem cell lines and its original mouse embroynic fibroblast were comparaed to defined mouse embroynic stem cell lines: R1 and CGR8.
