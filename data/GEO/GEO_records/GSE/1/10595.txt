TITLE
Interaction of bone marrow stroma and monocytes: bone marrow stromal cell lines cultured with monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hematopoietic microenvironment consists of  non-hematopoietic derived stromal elements and hematopoietic derived monocytes and macrophages which interact and function together to control the proliferation and differentiation of early blood-forming cells. Two human stromal cell lines (HS-5 and HS-27a) representing distinct functional components of this microenvironment have been extensively characterized and shown to influence monocyte gene expression. This series of gene expression profiles is intended to extend the previous studies and identify which gene expression changes may require cell-cell contact or occur in the stromal cells as a result of monocyte influence;or in the monocytes as a result of stormal influences. Keywords: cellular response to cell contact and secreted factors
