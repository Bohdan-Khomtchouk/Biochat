TITLE
Human skeletal muscle biopsies from a 3h IL-6 infusion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle has been identified as a secretory organ. We hypothesized that IL-6, a cytokine secreted from skeletal muscle during exercise, could induce production of other secreted factors in skeletal muscle. Keywords: Human skeletal muscle time course response to IL-6 infusion
