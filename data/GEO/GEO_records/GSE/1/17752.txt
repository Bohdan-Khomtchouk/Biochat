TITLE
Trichoderma reesei QM6a CGH self hybridization

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
We perform a self hybridisation comprative genomic hybridization (CGH) in order to validate the probe tiling design we done on Trichoderma reesei. This hybridization was done using QM6a wild type strain.

DESIGN
One biological replicate
