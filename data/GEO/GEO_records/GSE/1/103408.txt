TITLE
H3K9me3 chIP-seq 5 days following disruption of the SETDB1 H3K9 trimethylase with two different sgRNAs (6, and 9) or non-targeting control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed H3K9me3 chIP-seq 5 days following disruption of the SETDB1 H3K9 trimethylase with two different sgRNAs (6, and 9) or non-targeting control. Our data suggests that H3K9me3 is modestly reduced over transposable elements and some ZNF genes following disruption of SETDB1.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9me3 levels over standard genes and transposable elements in THP-1 cells following disruption of SETDB1
