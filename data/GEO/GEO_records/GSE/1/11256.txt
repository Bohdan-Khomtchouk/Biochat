TITLE
KCl depolarization-regulated genes in mouse cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that are induced by neuronal activity in excitatory neurons at the time when inhibitory synapses are forming and maturing on them. Keywords: Primary neuron culture, depolarization, activity-dependent
