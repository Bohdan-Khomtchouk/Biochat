TITLE
SNP/CNV analysis in a breast cancer metastasis model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix SNP/CNV (SNP 6.0) platform was used to analyze a cell line model of lymph node metastasis comprised of a poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468GFP human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and its highly metastatic variant (468LN).

DESIGN
DNA derived from 2 biological replicates of a highly metastatic (via lymph nodes) breast cancer cell line (468GFP-LN) was compared to 2 biological replicates of DNA prepared from the parental cell line, 468GFP.
