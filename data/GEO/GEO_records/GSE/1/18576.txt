TITLE
Microarray to determine gene expression changes in the DHR96 mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
DHR96 is a Drosophila member of the CAR/PXR/LXR family of Nuclear receptors. To Identify potential target genes for the DHR96 nuclear receptor we used microarray analysis to identify genes that were mis-regulated relative to control animals in the DHR96 mutant.
