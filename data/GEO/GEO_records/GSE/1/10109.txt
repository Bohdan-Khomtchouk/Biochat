TITLE
SAGE in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus following OP treatment of larvae from OP resistant/susceptible strains.

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Organophosphate resistant and susceptible tick larvae from laboratory strains of the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus were exposed to low doses of the organophosphate (OP) acaricide, coumaphos.  Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was used to analyze differential gene expression in response to OP treatment and to compare the responses in OP-treated and untreated resistant and susceptible tick larvae. ** note: Contact person is Felix D.
