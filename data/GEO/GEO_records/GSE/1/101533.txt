TITLE
Deletion of 11q in neuroblastomas drives sensitivity to PARP inhibition [SNP array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP arrays were combined with next generation sequencing (NGS) to precisely define the deleted region in 17 primary 11q-loss neuroblastomas and identify allelic variants in genes relevant for neuroblastoma aetiology. We assessed PARP inhibitor olaparib in combination with other chemotherapy medications using both in vitro and in vivo models.

DESIGN
CytoScan HD arrays (Affymetrix) were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from 17 neuroblastoma tumor samples and 7 neuroblastoma cell lines.
