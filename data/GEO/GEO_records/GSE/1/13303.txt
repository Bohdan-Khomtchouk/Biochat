TITLE
Gene Expression during the Egg Development of Drosophila melanogaster.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Despite the importance of egg development to the female life cycle in Drosophila, global patterns of gene expression have not been examined in detail primarily due to the difficulty of synchronizing developmental stages.  Entry into vitellogenesis is however an key stage of oogenesis, and by delaying entry past this control point, we have been able to investigate some of the transcriptional dynamics apparent before and after early egg formation over a 72 hour period.
