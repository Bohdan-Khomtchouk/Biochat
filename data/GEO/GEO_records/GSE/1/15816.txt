TITLE
Comparison of Labeling Methods for gene expression analysis on the NimbleGen platform

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison of ds-cDNA, Indirect and Direct Random Labeling Methods for gene expression analysis on the NimbleGen platform. Expression profiles from artemisinic acid-producing S. cerevisiae strain EPY330 and non-producing strain EPY338 are compared for each labeling method tested. The labeling methods and their comparison are described in detail in Ouellet et al., BMC Biotech 2009. Strains were described in detail previously in Ro et al. BMC Biotechnol 2008, 8(1):83 [PMID: 18983675]

DESIGN
RNA pools from strains EPY330 (sample A) and EPY338 (sample B) were reverse-transcribed and labeled in triplicate with the ds-cDNA, the Indirect and the new Direct Random method and hybridized in parallel on NimbleGen 4-plex arrays.
