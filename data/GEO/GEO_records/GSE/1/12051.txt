TITLE
Microarray predictor of response to infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We sought to find a gene-expression multigene predictor of response to infliximab therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. Using internal and external cross-validation systems we have built and validated an 8-gene predictor for response to infliximab.
