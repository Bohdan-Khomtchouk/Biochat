TITLE
The effects of temporally restricted feeding on hepatic gene expression of Cry1, Cry2 double KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Restricted feeding impacts the hepatic circadian clock of WT mice. Cry1, Cry2 double KO mice lack a circadian clock and are thus expected to show rhythmical gene expression in the liver. Imposing a temporally restricted feeding schedule on these mice  shows how the hepatic circadian clock and rhythmic food intake regulate rhythmic transcription in parallel
