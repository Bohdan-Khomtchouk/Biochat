TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in human erythroblasts differentiated from CD34+ cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment with thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, GC-1, significantly increased the signal intensities of the top 300 NCOA4 chromatin binding sites, which overlapped with binding sites for Pol II as well as with histone marks associated with active transcription, such as H3K27Ac and H3K4Me3, but not with marks such as H3K4Me1 commonly associated with enhancers

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin occupancy of NCOA4, RNA polymeriase, and histone modifications in human CD34+ derived erythroblasts. ------------------------------ Authors indicate that peaks were not called for H3K27Ac_GC1_ChIPSeq, H3K4Me3_GC1_ChIPSeq, NCOA4_untreated_ChIPSeq, H3K4Me1_GC1_ChIPSeq, and PolII_GC1_ChIPSeq.
