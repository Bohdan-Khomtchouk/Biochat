TITLE
Diagnosis of Morphologically Challenging Cases of Renal Epithelial Neoplasms by Virtual Karyotypes with SNP Arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal tumors with complex morphology require extensive workup for accurate classification.  Chromosomal aberrations that define subtypes of renal epithelial neoplasms have been reported. We explored if whole-genome chromosome copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays can be used to identify these aberrations in cases where morphology was unable to definitively classify these tumors. Keywords: Chromosome copy number and LOH analysis (virtual karyotyping) with SNP Genotyping Arrays Keywords: Genome variation profiling by SNP array
