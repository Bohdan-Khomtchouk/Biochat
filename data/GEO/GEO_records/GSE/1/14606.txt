TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice in relation to infection with rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines TW16-4 and TW16-69 were developed from the cross between TN1 (recurrent parent susceptible to RTSV) and Utri Merah (donor parent resistant to RTSV). TW16-4 is susceptible to RTSV, whereas TW16-69 is resistant to RTSV based on a serolog. Keywords: time course, virus infection, disease response
