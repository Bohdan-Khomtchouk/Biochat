TITLE
Global modulation of signaling pathways by SARM RAD140 in AR/ER+ breast cancer xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These data demonstrates the regulation of AR and ER pathways by the SARM RAD140 and suggested a unique mechanism of action of RAD140 via the AR-mediated transcription repression.

DESIGN
HBCx-22 PDX were treated with RAD140 or vehicle and snap frozen tumor samples were subjected to RNA-seq analysis at the end of the study
