TITLE
Spironolactone effect on renal RNA expression in 36 wk old NZB/W F1 female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aldosterone receptor blockade on the immunopathogenesis and progression of nephritis in the (NZBxNZW) F1 murine lupus model. Female NZB/W F1 mice (11 weeks old) were treated daily with 25 or 50 mg/kg of oral spironolactone or vehicle. Proteinuria, renal function and serum autoantibody levels were monitored. Renal histopathology, immune complex deposition, and immunohistochemistry were analyzed at various time points. Targeted microarray analysis was performed on renal tissue, with subsequent real time PCR analysis of several differentially expressed genes. Keywords: treatment study
