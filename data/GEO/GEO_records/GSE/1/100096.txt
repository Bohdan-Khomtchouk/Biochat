TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K9Me3 and Brg1 distribution between Wild Type (Wt) and Actb-/- (KNO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Chromatin-immunoprecipitation and NGS, we profiled the genome-wide H3K9Me3 and Brg1 distribution between Wild Type (Wt) and Actb-/- (KNO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9Me3 histone modifications and Brg1 distribution between Wild Type (Wt) and Actb-/- (KNO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.
