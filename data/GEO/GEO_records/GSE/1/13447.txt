TITLE
Heterologous Microarray Hybridization Between Vesicomyid Symbionts

ORGANISM
Candidatus Ruthia magnifica str. Cm (Calyptogena magnifica)

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to use heterologous microarray hybridization to determine genomic content shared among different vesicomyid symbionts.  These symbionts are closely related and can be thought of as different strains of bacteria, facilitating the use of heterologous microarray hybridization to determine genomic content. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
