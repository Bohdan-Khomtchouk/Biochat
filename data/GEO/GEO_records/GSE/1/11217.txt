TITLE
Altered gene expression changes in Arabidopsis leaf tissues and protoplasts in response to Plum pox virus infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Virus infection induces activation and suppression of global gene expression in the host. Profiling gene expression changes in the host may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie host physiological and phenotypic responses to virus infection. In this study, the Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome array was used to assess global gene expression changes in Arabidopsis thaliana plants infected with Plum pox virus (PPV). To identify early genes in response to PPV infection, an Arabidopsis synchronized single-cell transformation system was developed. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with a PPV infectious clone, PPV-SK68 and global gene expression changes in the transfected protoplasts were profiled. Keywords: Time course and cell type comparison
