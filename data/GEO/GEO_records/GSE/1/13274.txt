TITLE
Ad-HER-wt and Ad-HER2-ki infected HMECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As an oncogene, use of HER2 vaccines in humans requires the development of HER2 immunotherapies with maximal immunologic potential, but minimal oncologic potential.  To address these issues, we developed a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing a mutated HER2 inactivated for kinase function (Ad-HER2-ki).  Ad-HER2-ki was highly expressed, but non-phosphorylated and elicited minimal transcription dysregulation in primary cells.  In contrast, Ad-HER2-wt elicited a strong oncogenic signature associated with tumorigenesis.
