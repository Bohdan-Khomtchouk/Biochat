TITLE
Mouse EDL Muscle Chronic Electrical Stimulation Study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult male Swiss Webster mice (30-35 g) were anesthetized, a bipolar electrode was implanted adjacent to the sciatic nerve and the hindlimb immobilized. The voltage-force relation was determined to establish supramaximal stimulation conditions and the length-tension relation was determined to set the resting length for maximum twitch tension. Contractions were induced by sciatic nerve stimulation (0.5 msec duration, 2-5 volts). The muscles were allowed to rest 15 minutes for full metabolic recovery at physiologic temperatures. Supramaximal stimulation was applied at a rate of 10 Hz for 4 hours. At the end of each experiment the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were carefully dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of mRNA expression via microarray analysis. The contralateral, unstimulated EDL provided a genetically matched, paired control for each specimen.
