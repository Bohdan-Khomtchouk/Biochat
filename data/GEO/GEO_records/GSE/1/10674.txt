SUMMARY
ra07-02_aba2 - maternal/embryonic aba-1 - Identification of genes regulated by maternal and embryonic ABA - Comparison of expression in seeds (15 days after pollination) of aba2-2 mutant to wild type (Col-0), aba2 (female) x Col-0 (male) crossing, and aba2-2 sprayed with ABA (100 micro M, twice a week). Keywords: gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison
