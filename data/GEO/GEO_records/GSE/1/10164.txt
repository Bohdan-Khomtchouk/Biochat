TITLE
PrEC response to Alanine or Sarcosine at 6 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PrEC cells treated with either 50uM alanine or 50uM sarcosine (N-methylglycine). Gene expression is measured after 6 hours. We wish to look at the effects of sarcosine addition in relation to alanine addition. Keywords: Amino acid addition response
