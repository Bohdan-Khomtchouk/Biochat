TITLE
Arraystar lncRNA and mRNA array data for H9c2 myocytes from Hypoxia/reoxygenation model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) promotes the severity of cardiomyocyte injur. Our study provides a potential new therapeutic strategy to alleviate ischemia reperfusion injury.

DESIGN
Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced gene expression in H9c2 myocytes was measured at hypoxic condition (1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2) for 1 h and then under normoxic condition for 3 h and normoxic group. Three independent experiments were performed at each group.
