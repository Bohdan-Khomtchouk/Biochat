TITLE
Expression profiling of human adipose tissue derived stem cells cultured at various oxygen tensions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue is a plentiful and easily accessible source of mesenchymal stem cells that have been shown to be multi potent and possibly have immuno suppressive capacity(Zuk, Zhu et al. 2002; McIntosh, Zvonic et al. 2006; Prichard, Reichert et al. 2008). Several studies have identified hypoxia and the molecular effector of reduced oxygen tension, HIF1Î± to be essential in the differentiation processes, stem cell proliferation and survival as well as in maintenance of stem cell characteristics (Lennon, Edmison et al. 2001; Goda, Ryan et al. 2003; Wang, Fermor et al. 2005; Lin, Lee et al. 2006; Malladi, Xu et al. 2007; Ohnishi, Yasuda et al. 2007).  The fact that oxygen has a central role in cell development and metabolism makes the regulation of oxygen tension a valuable tool in the attempt of exploiting stem cells to their full potential.  In the current study we investigate the transcriptional changes caused by two weeks of monolayer hypoxic expansion of human adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs). Application of the XVivo hypoxic workstation (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY) made it possible to conduct the expansion of six ASC lines at four different hypoxic conditions in parallel covering the range from mild (15% oxygen) to full hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. In this comprehensive investigation the Illumina bead microarray platform was employed to give a profound and new insight in the molecular changes effectuated by hypoxic expansion.  The findings of this study demonstrate the significance of biologic variation in the transcriptional response to mild hypoxic expansion and display evidence that full hypoxic growth conditions at 1% oxygen tension selects for a more prolific cell population of reduced chondrogenic potential.
