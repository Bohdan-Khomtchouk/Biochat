TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Rat Hippocampus Following Exposure to the Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Soman

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Soman (O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is a potent neurotoxicant.  Acute exposure to soman causes profound inhibition of the critical enzyme acetylcholinesterase, resulting in excessive levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Excessive acetylcholine levels cause convulsions, seizures, and respiratory distress.  The initial cholinergic crisis can be overcome by rapid anti-cholinergic therapeutic intervention, resulting in increased survival.  However, conventional treatments do not protect the brain from seizure-related damage, and thus neurodegeneration of soman-sensitive areas of the brain is a potential post-exposure outcome.  We performed gene expression profiling of rat hippocampus following soman exposure to gain greater insight into the molecular pathogenesis of soman-induced neurodegeneration. Keywords: Time-course; toxicant exposure
