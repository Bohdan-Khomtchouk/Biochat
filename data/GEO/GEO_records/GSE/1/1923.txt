SUMMARY
Overall study: Identification of PDGF-dependent patterns of gene expression in U87 glioblastoma cells. RNA was obtained from triplicate dishes of 5 different groups of U87 cells, each (total 15) analyzed with one U95 microarray chip. Three different comparisons were made: 1) Clone 3.1 (34580-34582) vs. clone 3.3 (34583-34585) vs. parent U87 (34592-34594). Purpose: demonstrate that the gene expression profiles between these 3 cell lines are not different, so they could be pooled as a single untreated group. 2)  Pooled control group (34580-34585, 34592-34594) vs. clone 8.1 (34586-34588). Purpose:  identify genes specifically controlled by autocrine PDGF activity. 3)  Clone 8.1 (34586-34588) vs. clone 8.1 treated with PDGF (34589-34591) Purpose:  Identify genes specifically induced by exogenous PDGF.
