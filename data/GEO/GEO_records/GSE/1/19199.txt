TITLE
Expression data from serum-starved control and CDK8 depleted cells following serum stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Mediator complex allows communication between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). CDK8, the kinase found in some variants of Mediator, has been characterized mostly as a transcriptional repressor. Recently, CDK8 was demonstrated to be a potent oncoprotein. Here we show that CDK8 is predominantly a positive regulator of gene expression within the serum response network, as it is required for expression of several members of the AP-1 and EGR family of oncogenic transcription factors (e.g. FOS, JUN, EGR1-3). Mechanistic studies demonstrate that CDK8 is not required for recruitment of RNAPII and promoter escape at these loci. Instead, CDK8 depletion leads to the appearance of slower elongation complexes carrying hypophosphorylated RNAPII. We show that CDK8-Mediator regulates precise steps in the assembly of a functional elongation complex, including the recruitment of P-TEFb and BRD4, but is dispensable for recruitment of SPT5 and FACT. Furthermore, CDK8-Mediator specifically interacts with P-TEFb. Thus, we uncovered a novel role for CDK8 in transcriptional regulation that may contribute to its oncogenic effects. We used microarrays to analyze the expression of immediate early genes in response to serum in cells with and without the Mediator associated kinase, CDK8.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells expressing control and CDK8-directed short-hairpin RNAs were starved of serum for 40 hours, then RNA was isolated at time 0 and 30 minutes following serum stimulation.
