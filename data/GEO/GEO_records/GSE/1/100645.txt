TITLE
Differentially expressed non-coding RNAs in mouse islets during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pregnancy is associated with increased β-cell proliferation driven by prolactin. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are the most abundant RNA species in the mammalian genome, yet, their functional importance is mainly elusive. This study tests the hypothesis that lncRNAs regulate β-cell proliferation in response to prolactin in the context of β-cell mass compensation in pregnancy.
