TITLE
Gene expression of human paediatric osteosarcoma tumour samples relative to normal human osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gain or loss of genes and deregulation of gene expression can result in cumulative and progressive disruptions of normal cellular functions. Cancer-specific changes in gene expression play an essential role in cancer occurrence, and ultimately lead to cancer-related self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to growth inhibitory signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We aimed to analyse such changes in gene expression related to osteosarcoma.
