TITLE
identification of TGCT genes involved in initiation and maintenance of transformed germ cells.

SUMMARY
Initially, we had compared gene expression differences in the embryonic gonads (E13.5) of the 129 and M19 strains by performing microarray analysis.  These studies allowed us to identify downregulation of expression of the D19Bwg1357e, Zfp162 and Cox15 genes in the M19 strain. We next decided to examine gene expression profile changes in the embryonic gonads of 129 and M19 at additional stages so as to identify other TGCT genes from M19 that are also involved in initiation and maintenance of transformed germ cells.  For this we isolated E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 genital ridges from male embryos.
