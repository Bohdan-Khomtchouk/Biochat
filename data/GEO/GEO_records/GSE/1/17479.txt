TITLE
Effect of auxin signaling on flg22 response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression data after flg22 treatment on leaf discs in Col-0, 35S:AFB1 and 35S:miR393 We used microarrays to investigated the effect of auxin signaling on flg22 response pathway. We also compared if addition of auxin could simulated the 35S:AFB1 phenotype. Keywords: stress response, disease state analysis
