TITLE
Comparisonof  kPSCs versus cMSC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
expression profiles kPSCs versus cMSC Here we compare human kidney derived perivascular stromal cells  (hkPSCs) with kidney capsule derived MSCs (cMSC)

DESIGN
hkPSCs were isolated from human kidneys based on plastic adherence and NG2 expression. cMSCs were isolated from the kidney capsule by outgrowth culture
