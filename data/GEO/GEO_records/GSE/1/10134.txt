TITLE
GATA-1-regulated erythroid microRNAs

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed a gene complementation strategy combined with microarray screening to identify miRNAs involved in the formation of erythroid (red blood) cells.  To search for GATA-1-regulated erythroid miRNAs, we used the Gata-1â€“ erythroblast line G1E.  These cells proliferate in culture as immature erythroid precursors and undergo terminal maturation when GATA-1 activity is restored.  G1E-ER4 is a sub-line stably expressing an estrogen-activated form of GATA-1 (GATA-1 fused to the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor).  Treatment of G1E-ER4 cells with estradiol induces a GATA-1-regulated program of gene expression with concomitant cellular maturation.  We used a microarray to evaluate the expression of 292 different miRNAs in G1E-ER4 cells at 0 versus 24 hours after GATA-1 activation.  Affymetrix gene expression profiling has previously been deposited (GEO accession no. GSE628). Keywords: microRNA analysis of a cell-line model of erythroid maturation
