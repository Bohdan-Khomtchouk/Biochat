TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of laser-microdissected motorneurons in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease and is the second most common genetic disorder leading to death in childhood. Stem cell transplantation could represent a therapeutic approach for motor neuron diseases such as SMA.  We examined the theraputics effects of a spinal cord neural stem cell population and their ability to modify SMA phenotype. Microarray technology was used to assess the global gene expression profile of laser-microdissected motoneurons obtained by transplanted and veichle treated SMA, and wildtype mice. Keywords: Comparative Gene Expression Analysis
