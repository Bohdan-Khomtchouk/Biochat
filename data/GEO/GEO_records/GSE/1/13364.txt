TITLE
Expression data from BWF1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed on BWF1 mice spleenocyte cells in control and pCONS treated mice. Microarray analysis identified many genes differentially expressed in control vs pCONS treated mice spleenocytes. Some of the genes were uperegulated and some of the genes were down regulated. Microarray analysis was performed in CD4, CD8, and whole spleenocyte WBC cells. Keywords: One week after pCONS injection
