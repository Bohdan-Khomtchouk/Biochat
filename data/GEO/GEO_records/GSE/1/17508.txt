TITLE
Identification of human miR-22-responsive transcripts in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the expression patterns of human miR-22-responsive transcripts in estrogen receptor alpha positive cell line MCF7, we transfected miR-22 duplex or negative control RNA duplex into MCF7 cells. Gene expression patterns were then evaluated using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array microarrays. Keywords: comparision of expression patterns in MCF7 cells with or without  human miR-22 overexpression.
