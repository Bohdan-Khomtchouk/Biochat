TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of iMOS T1-Myc ESC mosaic cultures

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to analyse the transcriptome of WT and Myc-overexpressing ESCs in iMOS T1-Myc mosaic cultures.

DESIGN
Homozygous iMOS T1-Myc ESC cultures (Claveria et al., 2013) were treated with 20Î¼M 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 24 hours to generate a mosaic of cell populations containing two, one or no extra Myc and EYFP copies. 24 hours after tamoxifen removal, cells were sorted according to their EYFP expression levels and populations with two extra Myc and EYFP copies and with no extra Myc and EYFP copies were collected. Uninduced homozygous iMOS T1-Myc ESC cultures were also sorted and collected as a control. Three biological replicas were included for each condition.
