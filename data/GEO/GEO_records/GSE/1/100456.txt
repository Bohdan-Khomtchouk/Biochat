TITLE
gene expression profile of hippocampus from offspring exposure to maternal excessive estradiol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Accumulating researches suggest that exposure to abnormal environment in the uterus causes chronic diseases in future life. High intrauterine estradiol level is a major characteristic of in vitro fertilization. Here, we explored the potential neurodevelopment harm and behavior disorder of prenatal high estradiol exposure.

DESIGN
Hippocampus of five offspring from normal control offspring and five offspring from maternal excessive estradiol exposure group were included.
