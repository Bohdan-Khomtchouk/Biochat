TITLE
P. aeruginosa and indole and 7-hydroxyindole

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to investigate the impact of indole and 7-hdroxyindole on P. aeruginosa PAO1.For the microarray experiments, 10 g glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) were used to form biofilms in 250 mL in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks which were inoculated with overnight cultures of P. aeruginosa PAO1 diluted that were 1:100.  For P. aeruginosa with 7-hydroxyindole and indole, 500 uM 7-hydroxyindole in 250 uL DMF, 1000 uM indole in 250 uL DMF, or 250 uL DMF alone were added to cells grown in LB.  The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and at 37oC for 7 h to form biofilms on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the biofilm cells. Keywords: comparison with E. coli signal indole on P. aeruginosa PAO1
