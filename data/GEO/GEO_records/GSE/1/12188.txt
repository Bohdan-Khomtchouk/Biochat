Targets of the E. histolytica transcription factor URE3-BP

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
The E. histolytica transcription factor URE3-BP is a calcium-responsive regulator of two E. histolytica virulence genes, hgl5 and fdx1. URE3-BP was previously identified by a yeast one-hybrid screen of E. histolytica proteins capable of binding to the sequence TATTCTATT (URE3) in the promoter regions of hgl5 and fdx1.  In this work precise definition of the consensus URE3 element was performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using base-substituted oligonucleotides, and the consensus motif validated using episomal reporter constructs. Transcriptome profiling of a strain induced to produce a dominant-positive URE3-BP was then used to identify additional genes regulated by URE3-BP. Fifty modulated transcripts were identified, and of these the EMSA defined motif T[atg]T[tc][cg]T[at][tgc][tg] was found in over half of the promoters (54% p < 0.0001). Fifteen of the URE3-BP regulated genes were potential membrane proteins suggesting that one function of URE3-BP is to remodel the surface of E. histolytica in response to a calcium signal.  Induction of URE3-BP lead to an increase in tranwell migration suggesting a possible role in the regulation of cellular motility.
