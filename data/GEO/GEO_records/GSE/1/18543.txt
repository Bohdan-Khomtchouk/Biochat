TITLE
Mesenchymal progenitors from hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
New potential sources of stem cells for clinical application include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS).  However, each source is not without its own concerns.  While research continues in an effort overcome these problems, the generation of mesenchymal progenitors from existing hESC lines may circumvent many of these issues.  We report here a comparison of the transcriptome of hESC-derived mesenchymal progenitors (EMPs), its parental hESC line, and 2 donors of adult BMMSCs.
