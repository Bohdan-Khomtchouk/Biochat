TITLE
Liver gene expression profiles of TLR3-/- versus TLR3wt (C57Bl/6) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
cDNA was prepared from total liver RNA taken from untreated, 3 months old, TLR3-/- and TLR3wt C57Bl/6 mice

DESIGN
cDNA was prepared from total liver RNA taken from untreated, 3 months old, TLR3-/- and TLR3wt C57Bl/6 mice each group contained 3 mice
