TITLE
Expression data from POLG1 patients and control subjects muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pathogenic mutations in the catalytic DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene result in the accumulation of mtDNA mutations, deletions and/or decrease of mtDNA copy number. These features interfere with proper functioning of the electron transport chain, mostly affecting metabolically active tissues such as the brain, the heart and the liver. So far, mechanisms underlying POLG pathogenesis are not fully understood. To identify general pathways influenced by mutant polymerase gamma, skeletal muscle gene expression profiles of six POLG1 patients and twelve controls were compared.

DESIGN
Patient and control subject from three age categories ( < 10; 11-49; > 50) were selected. RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
