TITLE
Co-culture stress in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
This set of microarray data was used to compare the effects of D. vulgaris grown syntrophically with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen versus D. vulgaris grown in sulfate-limited monoculture. Keywords: physiological response, one time point (stable continuous culture for both control and treated cells)

DESIGN
Comparison of cells treated with DvH + Mm co-culture + lactate only FC36, FC38, FC44 Co-culture to untreated cells at times of continuous culture at 24 hr retention time min.
