TITLE
Changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA abundance following oxidative stress and DNA damage stress

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We subjected yeast to two stresses, oxidative stress, which under current settings induces a fast and transient response in mRNA abundance, and DNA damage, which  triggers a slow enduring response. Using microarrays we performed a conventional quantification of change in mRNA abundance. Keywords: Two separate time courses
