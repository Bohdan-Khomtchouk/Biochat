Analysis of the CcpA regulon in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Background The catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is a member of the LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators controlling carbon-metabolism pathways in low-GC Gram positive bacteria. It functions as a catabolite repressor or activator, allowing the bacteria to utilize the preferred carbon source over secondary carbon sources. This study is the first CcpA-dependent transcriptome and proteome analysis in S. aureus wild type and ccpA-deleted mutant, focussing on short-time effects of glucose under stable pH conditions. Results The addition of glucose to exponentially growing S. aureus increased enzymes of glycolytic pathway, indicating a higher glycolytic activity, while proteins required for the complete oxidation in the TCA cycle were repressed via CcpA. Phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase, converting acetylCoA to acetate with a concomitant substrate-level phosphorylation were neither regulated by glucose nor by CcpA. Most CcpA directly repressed genes were involved in utilization of amino acids as secondary carbon sources. More genes were found to be differentially expressed by CcpA in a glucose-independent manner than in the classical, glucose dependent way, suggesting that glucose-independent regulation by CcpA may be of particular importance in S. aureus. In the presence of glucose, CcpA was found to regulate expression of genes involved in metabolism, but that of genes coding for virulence determinants. Conclusions This study identified the CcpA regulon of exponentially growing S. aureus, for the first time. As in other bacteria, the CcpA-regulon of S. aureus comprised a large amount of metabolic genes but also some 50 genes associated with virulence. CcpA seemed to work in a glucose- as well as glucose-independent way.
