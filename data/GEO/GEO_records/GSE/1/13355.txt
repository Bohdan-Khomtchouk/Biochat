TITLE
Gene expression data of skin from psoriatic patients and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression has been proposed as an intermediate phenotype that can increase power in complex trait gene-mapping studies. Psoriasis, an immune-mediated, inflammatory and hyperproliferative disease of the skin and joints, provides an ideal model system to evaluate this paradigm, as conclusive evidence demonstrates that psoriasis has a genetic basis and the disease tissue is readily accessible. To better understand the complex nature of processes in psoriasis, we characterize gene expression profiles in uninvolved and involved skin from affected individuals as well as normal skin from control individuals. Keywords: disease state analysis
