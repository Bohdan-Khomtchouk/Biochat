TITLE
LiaR Transcriptome in Streptococcus agalactiae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a leading cause of early-onset neonatal bacterial infection.  Evasion of innate immune defenses is critical to neonatal GBS disease pathogenesis.  Effectors of the innate immune system such as antimicrobial peptides, as well as numerous antibiotics, target the peptidoglycan layer of the gram positive bacterial cell wall.  The intramembrane-sensing histidine kinase class of two-component regulatory systems has recently been identified as important to the gram-positive response to cell wall stress.  We identified and characterized the GBS homolog of LiaR, the response regulator component of the LiaFSR system and constructed site-directed, non-polar deletion mutations in the regulator gene liaR.  GBS LiaR deletion mutant strains are more susceptible to cell wall active antibiotics (vancomycin and bacitracin) as well as antimicrobial peptides (colistin, nisin and the human cathelicidin LL-37) compared to isogenic wild-type GBS.  LiaR mutant GBS are significantly attenuated in mouse models of both GBS sepsis and GBS pneumonia.  To determine the genes regulated by LiaR that account for these defects, transcriptional profiling was performed using DNA microarray analysis, comparing wild-type GBS to LiaR mutant GBS under non-stressed conditions.
