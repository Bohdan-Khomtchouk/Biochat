TITLE
Global transcription profiles of Trichophyton rubrum in response to Flucytosine

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to 5-Flucytosine were determined. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
