TITLE
Gene expression profiling during storage root formation in sweet potato

ORGANISM
Ipomoea batatas

SUMMARY
A Microarray experiment was carried out in order to establish the genetic processes and control mechanism involved during storage root formation in Sweetpotato. A Sweetpotato cDNA chip was created from five varieties covering all the growth stages between them. mRNA from primordial root, fibrous root, pencil root and thick storage root was extracted from four varieties of Sweetpotato. The expression profiles were compared between the root growth stages. Keywords: Transcription profiling
