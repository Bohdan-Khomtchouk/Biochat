TITLE
Formaldehyde stress response in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

ORGANISM
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to use microarrays to identify genes differentially regulated under conditions of formaldehyde stress relative to two other stress conditions (oxidative, osmotic) in an effort to identify genes that might be involved in a formaldehyde-specific stress response, rather than a general stress response, in the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.

DESIGN
Two color experiment, three treatments, three biological replicates per treatment, and two technical (dye swap) replicates per biological replicate: formaldehyde-stressed vs. unstressed cells; oxidative-stressed vs. unstressed cells; and osmotic-stressed vs. unstressed cells.
