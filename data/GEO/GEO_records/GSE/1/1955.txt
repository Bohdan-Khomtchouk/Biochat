TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by K-ras oncogene in the human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line (H6c7)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
k-ras oncogene was transduced into the HPV16-E6E7 immortalized normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line (H6c7) to generate a stable K-ras oncogene-expressing cell line (H6c7-Kr). The gene expression profile of the H6c7-Kr cells was compared to that of H6c7 cells. We have excluded (subtracted) genes that were deregulated by transduction of the construct used for K-ras oncogene expression. Keywords: parallel sample
