TITLE
Identification of a Serum Induced Transcriptional Signature Associated with Type 1 Diabetes in the BioBreeding Rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Human type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises through autoimmunity towards the insulin-producing pancreatic β cells and is modeled by the BioBreeding (BB) rat.  Factors associated with islet autoimmunity are dilute and difficult to directly measure in the periphery. Therefore, we previously utilized microarray-based bioassay where human T1D sera were used to induce a disease-specific gene expression signature in unrelated, healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Here we report that sera of both spontaneously diabetic BB DRlyp/lyp and diabetes inducible BB DR+/+ rats induce inflammatory signatures in healthy PBMC of non-diabetic Brown Norway (BN) rats, while allogeneic BN sera does not.  Consistent with their common T1D susceptibility, transcriptional signatures of both BB sub-strains share identity, including cytokines, immune receptors and signaling molecules.  However, like the human T1D signature, the DRlyp/lyp signature, which is associated with progression to diabetes, is differentiated from that of the DR+/+ by induction of many IL-1 regulated genes.  Addition of IL-1RA to cultures significantly ablates the DRlyp/lyp signature.  Daily treatment of DRlyp/lyp rats with human recombinant IL-1RA significantly delays onset and sera of treated animals do not induce the characteristic IL-1 signature.  Consistent with the presence of immune regulation in DR+/+ rats is induction of a signature showing negative regulation of the NFκB pathway. This study supports prior human investigations of serum that reflect disease processes associated with progression to T1D and add to a growing body of evidence implicating the balance of IL-1 and IL-1RA as key factors influencing the severity and outcome of inflammatory responses.
