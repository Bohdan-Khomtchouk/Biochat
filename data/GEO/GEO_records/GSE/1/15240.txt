TITLE
Gene expression in laboratory models and primary tumors in Small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was measured on the Affymetrix platform in primary xenografts, xenograft-derived cell lines, secondary xenografts, normal lung, and primary tumors obtained from chemotherapy naive Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). The SCLC primary xenografts were serially propagated in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Cell lines were derived from each xenograft and grown for 6 months using conventional tissue culture conditions. Secondary xenografts were obtained from cell cultures by re-implantation in immunodeficient mice. Such SCLC laboratory models were analyzed along with conventional SCLC cell lines and the derivative secondary xenografts, with normal lung and primary tumors, to assess irreversible gene expression changes induced by culturing conditions.

DESIGN
SCLC primary xenografts were compared to the corresponding xenograft-derived cell lines, and to the secondary xenografts established from the cell lines using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Gene expression from SCLC primary tumors was measured using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array. 3 datasets: GSM380476-GSM380512, GSM380513-GSM380516, and GSM380517-GSM380520
