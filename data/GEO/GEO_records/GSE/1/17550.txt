SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of in vitro-infected (Leishmania major) and uninfected bone-marrow-derived macrophages from BALB/c, C57BL/6, C.B6-(lmr1, lmr2) and B6.c-(lmr1, lmr2) mouse strains. We utilised microarrays to investigate a number of issues. Firstly, we determined which genes were differentially regulated in macrophages in response to infection with Leishmania major. Secondly, we hoped to gain some insight into the differences between C-B6-(lmr1, lmr2) congenic mice and their parental control BALB/c, as well as differences between B6-c-(lmr1, lmr2) and their parental control C57BL/6. This would aid us in the search for the genes underlying our loci, since the only genomic regions differing between the two strains are those of the two congenic intervals on chromosomes 9 and 17. Any genes differentially regulated would be contributing to the experimental infection differences observed between the congenic mice and their parental controls.
