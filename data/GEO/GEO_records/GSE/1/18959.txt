TITLE
Comparison of neuroepithelial cells and regionally specified astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These arrays were conducted in order to confirm the generation of astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells and to determine expression differences between astrocyte subtypes.

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells were differentated in vitro to neuroepithelial cells (day-17), or astrocytes (day-210) after specification with the morphogens retinoic acid (RA) or FGF8 from days 10-21.
