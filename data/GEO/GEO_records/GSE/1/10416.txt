TITLE
Gene expression based profiling of brains from mice infected with lethal Listeria monocytogenes over a 4-day period

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data presented here show that gene expression in the mouse brain changes  during systemic infection relative to a steady state (uninfected control) mouse during systemic Listeria monocytogenes infection.  Microarray analysis of gene expression in the brain following i.v. inoculation of 1-2 LD 50 L. monocytogenes showed changes in brain transcriptional activity occurred prior to brain infection. Keywords: infectious diseases model, gene expression profiling for cell signaling/trafficking
