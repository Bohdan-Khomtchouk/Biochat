TITLE
A compendium of antibiotic-induced transcription profiles reveals broad regulation of P. multocida virulence genes

ORGANISM
Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida str. Pm70

SUMMARY
Treatment of bacteria with antibiotics at or close to the inhibitory concentration leads to specific transcriptional responses often affecting target genes and targets pathways. A dataset of transcriptional profiles (compendium) induced by antibiotics with known mode-of-action (MoA) can be used to gain information on the putative MoA of novel substances with unknown MoAs. We used a Pasteurella multocida microarray to generate a compendium of transcriptional profiles and to obtain information on the putative MoA of a novel antibiotic compound. We also show a strong impact of the bacteriostatic antibiotics on P. multocida virulence gene transcription. Keywords: antibiotica treatment, time course
