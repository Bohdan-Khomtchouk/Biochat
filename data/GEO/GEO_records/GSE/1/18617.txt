TITLE
Single-cell gene expression data from Bergmann glial cells of mouse cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bergmann glial cells of the vertebrate cerebellum play essential roles in the development and maintenance of cerebellar structure and function.  During development, Bergmann glia provide structural support to the expanding cerebellar anlage and also serve as guides for migrating neurons (granule cells).  As the cerebellum matures, Bergmann glia become important in dendritic arborization, synapse maintenance and synaptic function.  The molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse and important functions of Bergmann glia remain largely unknown. We used microarray analysis to examine global gene expression in individual Bergmann glial cells derived at P6 (a time of extensive neuronal migration and cerebellar growth) and at P30 (when cerebellar development is complete and Bergmann glia play important roles at synapses).

DESIGN
After gentle dissociation of cerebellar tissue derived from mice expressing GFP under the GFAP gene promoter (GFAP-GFP mice) (Zhuo, L., et al., 1997, Developmental biology), single GFP-positive Bergmann glial cells were aspirated into microcapillary tubes.  Amplified cDNAs were prepared from single cells using RT-PCR and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 expression arrays (one array per cell).  Five P6 cells and five P30 cells were used to generate the data presented in this study.
