TITLE
Global gene expression analysis identifies molecular pathways distinguishing blastocyst dormancy and activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Delayed implantation occurs in many mammals, but the underlying mechanisms that direct this process remain largely unknown. In mice, ovariectomy prior to the preimplantation ovarian estrogen secretion on day 4 of pregnancy initiates blastocyst dormancy, which can be maintained for more than 200 days by continued progesterone Keywords: other
