TITLE
Genes regulated after transient knock-down of Pirin in WM-266 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pirin (PIR) is a putative transcriptional regulator abundantly expressed in melanocytes and in a subset of primary and metastatic melanomas. Ablation of PIR in the melanoma cell lines results in induction of a senescence-like phenotype. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation, knock-down using siRNA
