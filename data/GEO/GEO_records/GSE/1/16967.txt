TITLE
Expression data from ERK1/2 null endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by both growth factors and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and is initiated by focal degradation of the vascular basement membrane with subsequent migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (EC).  The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is critical for EC function during angiogensis.   Although in vitro studies implicate ERK1 and ERK2 in EC survival, their precise role in EC function in vivo remains poorly defined.  Cre/loxP technology was used to inactivate Erk1 and Erk2 in EC during murine development, resulting in embryonic lethality due to a drastic reduction in angiogenesis.  The angiogenic defect was linked to diminished EC proliferation and migration, but not to increased cell apoptosis.  Expression of key cell cycle regulators was diminished in the double knockout cells.  In addition, both Paxillin and Focal Adhesion Kinase were expressed at lower levels and failed to correctly localize to the cell membrane in EC lacking Erk1 and Erk2, leading to defects in the organization of the cytoskeleton and in cell motility.  The results demonstrate that ERK1 and ERK2 coordinate cell proliferation and migration during angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Lentivirus infected cells to generate ERK1/2 WT and ERK1/2 DKO endothelial cells were cultured, RNA was extracted and Affymetrix gene expression arrays were performed.
