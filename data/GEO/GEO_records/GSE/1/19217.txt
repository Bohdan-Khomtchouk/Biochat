TITLE
Low temperatures impact dormancy status, flowering competence, and transcript profiles in crown buds of leafy spurge.

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is an herbaceous perennial weed that produces vegetatively from an abundance of underground adventitious buds. The objectives of this study were to determine how mimicking natural seasonal conditions (photoperiod and temperature) under controlled environmental conditions affect dormancy and flowering competence; to determine molecular mechanisms associated with well-defined phases of seasonal dormancy transitions based on transcript profiles obtained by microarray analysis; and to link mechanisms regulating induction and release of endodormancy and flowering competence. Reduction in temperature (27 to 10°C) and photoperiod (16 to 8 h) over a three-month period induced a para- to endo-dormant transition in crown buds. An additional eleven weeks of prolonged cold (5-7°C) and short-photoperiod treatment resulted in accelerated shoot growth from crown buds, and 99% floral competence when plants were returned to growth promoting conditions. Exposure of paradormant plants to short-photoperiod and prolonged cold treatment alone had minimal affect growth potential or on flowering (~1%); whereas endodormant crown buds without prolonged cold treatment, had delayed shoot growth and approximately 2% flowering when returned to growth promoting conditions. Transcriptome analyses revealed that 373 and 260 genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.005) during para- to endo-dormant and endo- to eco-dormant transitions, respectively. Transcripts from flower competent vs. non-flower competent crown buds identified 607 differentially expressed genes, and genes involved in cell cycle and DNA processing, oxidative stress, flower regulation, and proteolysis were over-represented. Further, sub-network analysis identified expression targets and binding partners associated with circadian clock, dehydration/cold signaling, phosphorylation cascades, and response to abscisic acid, ethylene, gibberellic acid, and jasmonic acid, suggesting these central regulators affect well-defined phases of dormancy. Potential genetic pathways associated with these dormancy transitions and flowering were used to develop a proposed conceptual model.
