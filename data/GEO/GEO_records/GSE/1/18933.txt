TITLE
Biogeography of the human colorectum

ORGANISM
Bacteria

SUMMARY
We applied numerical ecology methods to data produced with a human intestinal tract-specific phylogenetic microarray (the Aus-HIT Chip) to examine the biogeography of mucosa-associated bacteria along the human colon. The microbial DNA associated with matched biopsy tissue samples taken from the cecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum of 10 healthy patients was examined. Consistent with previous studies, the profiles revealed a marked inter-subject variability; however, the numerical ecology methods of analysis allowed the subtraction of the subject effect from the data and revealed, for the first time, evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes along the colorectum: with Streptococcus, Comamonadaceae, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus in greatest abundance at the cecum, with a gradual decline in their relative abundance through to the rectum. Conversely, the analyses suggest that members of the Enterobacteriaceae increase in relative abundance towards the rectum. These differences were validated by quantitative PCR. We were also able to identify significant differences in the profiles, especially for the Streptococci, on the basis of gender. The results derived by these multivariate analyses are biologically intuitive, and suggestive that the biogeography of the colonic mucosa can be monitored for changes via cross-sectional and/or inception cohort studies.

DESIGN
10 patients, 5 males and 5 females. Four different locations along the colorectum.
