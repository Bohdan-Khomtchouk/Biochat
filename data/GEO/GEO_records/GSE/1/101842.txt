TITLE
Expression data from KSRP knockdown lung cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KSRP depleted CL1-0 cells were used to identify genes regulated by KSRP We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying metastasis and identified distinct classes of KSRP-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
CL1-0 cells stablely depleted KSRP expression were analyzed compare to scramble control cells
