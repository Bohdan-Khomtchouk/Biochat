TITLE
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) modulates lifespan of C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is formed naturally from L-cysteine in a variety of mammalian and non-mammalian cells. To date, numerous biological effects have been ascribed to H2S including control of cardiovascular, immune and nervous function. Over or under production of H2S has been observed in several disease states including hypertension and inflammation. In addition, it has been stipulated that H2S may affect the ageing process. The model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is ideally suited for assessing drug effects on lifespan since it is relatively short-lived, can be easily exposed to drugs and its genome is fully sequenced and widely annotated.

DESIGN
The global transcriptome of control nematodes (raised using standardized laboratory conditions) was compared to nematodes exposed to 100 uM GYY4137 (morpholin-4-ium 4 methoxyphenyl(morpholino) phosphinodithioate), a slow releasing H2S donor drug.
