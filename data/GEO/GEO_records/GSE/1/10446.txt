TITLE
A linear-mixed model approach to identify expressed SFPs using short oligo microarrays - Placenta vs. Fibroblast

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Background: Genome-wide detection of single feature polymorphisms (SFP) in swine using transcriptome profiling of day 25 placental RNA by contrasting probe intensities from either Meishan or an occidental composite breed with Affymetrix porcine microarrays is presented. A linear mixed model analysis was used to identify significant breed-by-probe interactions.  This dataset uses different tissue types to explore the consequences of additional sample variance. Keywords: Transcriptional profiling of porcine tissues
