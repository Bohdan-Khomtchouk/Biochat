Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A microarray study performed in the pancreatic lymph nodes of Deaf1 knock-out and BALB/c control mice to identify genes that are regulated by the transcriptional regulator Deaf1.  These experiments constitute a portion of the study described below: Abstract: Type 1diabetes (T1D) can result from a breakdown in peripheral tolerance which is controlled by peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) expression in lymph nodes.  Here, we identified a transcriptional regulator, deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1), which regulates the expression of various PTAs in the pancreatic lymph node (PLN). We found, by microarray, that Deaf1 controls the expression of ~600 genes in the PLN.  In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, we identified a wild-type form of Deaf1 (DF1) and a truncated alternatively spliced variant (DF1-VAR1) that hetero-dimerizes with and decreases the transcriptional activity of DF1. The expression of DF1 correlates with the expression of various pancreatic PTAs such as insulin, and during the onset of destructive insulitis in NOD mice, DF1 expression is downregulated, while the DF1-VAR1 expression is upregulated in the PLN.  A reduction in DF1-controlled PTA expression in the PLN, leading to decreased peripheral tolerance, could underlie the pathogenesis of NOD disease.
