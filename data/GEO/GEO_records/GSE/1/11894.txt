TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli cultured under severe zinc limitation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in parallel chemostat cultures in GGM.  In one chemostat the culture was fed adequate Zn; in the other, measures were taken to eliminate Zn from the chemostat vessel and culture medium.  Culture volume (120 ml), temperature (37 oC) and stirring speed (437 rpm) were maintained.  Steady state values for pH and OD600 were 6.9 and 0.6, respectively. After 50 hours, samples from the adequate Zn and Zn-limited chemostats were harvested into RNAprotect and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit (using the supplier’s protocol) prior to use in microarray analysis.  Biological experiments (i.e. a comparison of adequate versus low Zn in chemostat culture) were carried out three times, and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing two technical repeats for each of the three biological repeats.
