TITLE
miR101 overexpression vs. EZH2 RNAi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of genes in SKBr3 cells. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a mammalian histone methyltransferase that contributes to the epigenetic silencing of target genes and regulates the survival and metastasis of cancer cells. EZH2 is overexpressed in aggressive solid tumors by mechanisms that remain unclear. Here we show that the expression and function of EZH2 in cancer cell lines are inhibited by microRNA-101 (miR-101).
