TITLE
Genomic DNA mixture series in Allele Specific Expression study

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA of Col-0, Van-0 and their mixture at different proportion were labeled using Bioprime randon labeling kit. A total of 16ug labelled products were hybridized to AtSNPtile1. This experiment is to test whether the log allele intensity ratio efficiently detects the allelic variation within targets.

DESIGN
Templates include four Col genomic DNA replicates, four Van genomic DNA replicates, three Col and Van 1:1 mixture replicates, and one of each 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1 Col and Van mixture. Single chanel. Total 17 samples.
