TITLE
Striatum of Huntington's disease model mice [Affymetrix data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of transcriptional changes in the striatum may be an effective approach to understanding the natural history of changes in expression contributing to the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (HD). We have performed genome-wide expression profiling of the YAC128 transgenic mouse model of HD at 12 and 24 months of age using two platforms in parallel; Affymetrix and Illumina. We performed gene expression profiling on the same striatal mRNA across both platforms.
