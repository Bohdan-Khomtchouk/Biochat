TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human mesenchymal stem cells stimulated with canonical Wnt signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hMSC overexpressing activated or inactivated Wnt co-receptor LRP5 exhibit opposite phenotypes in osteogenesis and adipogenesis. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we compared gene expression profiles upon Wnt3a stimulation and aimed at those genes functionally involved in determination of differentiation fate of hMSC.

DESIGN
Total RNA from hMSC overexpressing activated LRP5 (T253) or inactivated LRP5 (T244) treated with Wnt3a condition medium for 1 hour or 24 hours was compared with those treated with control condition medium. 3 replicates per condition. The supplementary file 'GSE16186_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized data for Samples GSM406367-GSM406390.
