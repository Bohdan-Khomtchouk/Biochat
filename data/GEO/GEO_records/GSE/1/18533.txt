TITLE
Germination of Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula) Seeds under Constant and Alternating Temperature

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes were investigated for Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) seeds with a focus on the effect of constant and diurnal fluctuating temperature on dormancy and germination. Leafy spurge seeds do not germinate when incubated for 21 days at 20째C constant temperatures, but nearly 30% germinate after 21 days under fluctuating temperatures 20:30째C (16:8 h). Incubation at 20째C for 21 followed by 20:30째C resulted in approximately 63% germination in about 10 days. A cDNA microarray representing approximately 22,000 unique sequences was used to profile transcriptome changes.
