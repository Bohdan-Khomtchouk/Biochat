TITLE
Cellulose-induced regulation of Phanaerochaete chrysosporium genes

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium RP-78

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on different substrates were analyzed. Array design based on the DoE's Joint Genome Institute's v2.1 annotation. Goal is to define genes involved in cellulose degradation. Keywords: gene expression under different culture conditions
