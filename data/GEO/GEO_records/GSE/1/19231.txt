TITLE
Identification of Sfh and H-NS binding sites in the Salmonella Typhimurium genome

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
The global regulator H-NS represses transcription in gram negative bacteria. Sfh is a homologue of H-NS and is encoded by plasmid pSfR27. Sfh provides a 'stealth' function that allows pSfR27 to be transmitted to a new host without disrupting the competitive fitness of the new host We used ChIP-on-chip to profile Sfh (3xFLAG-tagged) and H-NS binding sites in Salmonella Typhimurium strain SL1344 and found that Sfh provides its 'stealth' function by targeting a sub-set of H-NS bound genes that display reduced levels of H-NS occupancy with the SL1344 chromosome upon acquisition of plasmid pSfR27

DESIGN
Identification of Sfh binding sites in strains SL1344 (pSfR27) and SL1344 hns (pSfR27) as well as identification of H-NS binding sites in strains SL1344, SL1344 (pSfR27), and SL1344 (pSfR27) sfh
