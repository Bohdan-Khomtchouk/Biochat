TITLE
Response of Blastocladiella emersonii to hypoxia, iron deprivation and geldanamycin treatment followed by hypoxia.

ORGANISM
Blastocladiella emersonii

SUMMARY
Due to its aquatic saprophytic lifestyle, the fungus Blastocladiella emersonii seems to be adapted to low aerated environments and thus can be an interesting model of study of the hypoxic stress response. Iron deprivation, a hypoxia-mimicking stimulus due to HIF-1 stabilization, and geldanamycin, that causes HIF-1 depletion by HSP90 inhibition, are helpful parameters to find an evidence of an oxygen-dependent regulatory mechanism in B. emersonii similar to the metazoan HIF-1 pathway.
