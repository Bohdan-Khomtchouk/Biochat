TITLE
Gene expression profile of zebrafish kidney side population (SP) cells

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Side population (SP) cells are identified based on their capacity to efflux of the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342, and are enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mammalian bone marrow. We recently demonstrated that SP cells were present in the teleost kidney, the main hematopoietic organ in teleosts, and were enriched for HSCs. In this analysis, to identify the regulated genes in teleost HSCs, gene expression analysis of zebrafish kidney SP cells were performed using the GeneChip Zebrafish Genome Array.
