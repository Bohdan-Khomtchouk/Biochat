TITLE
Ultraviolet induced gene expression in human basal cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data set was generated as part of Biogen Community Lab's science fair mentorship program. In brief, human basal cells (ATCC: CRL-7761, designation TE 353.Sk) were cultured to 80% confluence. After removing media, cells were treated with a titration of ultraviolet light (Biorad GS GeneLinker, 254 nm energy maximum). Media was then added and cells were grown for 24 hours. Total RNA was harvested using RLT buffer and Qiagen RNeasy kit. 5 ug of total RNA was labeled using standard Affymetrix protocols for Eukaryotic target preparation (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual Revision 4). GeneChip intensity values were scaled to 2500 RFU. Keywords = UV Keywords = ultraviolet Keywords = basal cell Keywords: dose response
