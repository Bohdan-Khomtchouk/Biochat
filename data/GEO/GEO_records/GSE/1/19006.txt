TITLE
Ad-MyD88 infected bmDCs: Control vs. Ad-MyD88 infected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Bone-Marrow derived mouse Dendritic Cells (bmDCs) infected with Ad-MyD88 vs. Ad-GFP or mock infected

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Ad-MyD88 vs. Ad-GFP vs. Mock infected cells. Biological replicates: 3 Ad-MyD88, 3 Ad-GFP, 3 mock, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
