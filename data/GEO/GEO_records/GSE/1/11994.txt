TITLE
Liver gene expression profiling of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 heterozygous knockout (Tgfbr2+/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) was predicted as a causal gene for abdominal using a novel statistical method named LCMS (Schadt et al., 2005, Nature Genetics). In order to validate this prediction, we profiled the liver tissues of Tgfbr2 heterozygous knockout mice (Tgfbr2+/-)  and their littermate wild-type (wt) controls to examine the gene expression signature as well as pathways/networks resulting from the single gene perturbation.
