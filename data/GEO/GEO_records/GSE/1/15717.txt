TITLE
Nuclear and Extranuclear Pathway Inputs in the Regulation of Global Gene Expression by Estrogen Receptors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whereas estrogens exert their effects by binding to nuclear estrogen receptors and directly altering target gene transcription, they can also initiate extranuclear signaling through activation of kinase cascades. We have investigated the impact of estrogen-mediated extranuclear initiated pathways on global gene expression by using estrpgen-dendrimer conjugates. Keywords: ligand treatment

DESIGN
MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells were treated with empty dendrimer control, E2, or Estrogen Dendrimer Conjugate (EDC) for 4 hours, and cDNA microarray analyses were carried out using Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips
