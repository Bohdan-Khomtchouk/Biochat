TITLE
Illumina expression data from LNCaP cells overexpressing either SOX4 or GFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX4 is a critical developmental transcription factor in vertebrates and is required for   precise differentiation and proliferation in multiple tissues.  In addition, SOX4 is   overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of SOX4 in cancer   progression is not well understood.  Here we have performed an expression profiling experiment of LNCaP cells either overexpressing SOX4 or GFP to identify SOX4 target genes. Keywords: Gene expression
