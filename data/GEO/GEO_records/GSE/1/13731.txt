TITLE
The meiotic transcriptome of the basidomycete fungus Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus)

ORGANISM
Coprinopsis cinerea

SUMMARY
Coprinopsis cinerea exhibits synchronised meiosis  in the gill tissue of the fungus, which is 75% meiotic.  The mushroom develops from a dikaryon, which contains two separate nuclei.  These nucleifuse in the basidia (karyogamy).  After karyogamy, the nuclei enter an extended meiotic prophase, in which pahcytene occurs at 6 hours post karyogamy (K+6).  The tetrads produced by the second meiotic division are present 12 hours after karyogamy (K+12).  To examine a comprehensive timecourse of meiosis in this organism, we took samples over a 15-hour period, 3 hours apart:  K-3, K, K+3, K+6, K+9, K+12. Keywords: time course
