TITLE
ArrayCGH mapping of the recurrent 3q26.3-q27 amplifications in lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To prospectively identify new oncogenes implicated in lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma pathogenesis, we investigated chromosome 3 aberrations in advanced tumours using arrayCGH. Chromosome 3 aberrations are indeed among the most frequent alterations in lung SCC and correlate with SCC patient's poor prognosis. We have precisely mapped regions of recurrent losses at 3p and gains at 3q25-qter in a series of lung SCC (GSE14859) amd moreover uncover 3q26.3-q27 high level amplifications in 20% of tumours. These amplicons were precisely mapped in these tumors using arraCGH with a 3q26.3 dedicated tiling array. Keywords : ArrayCGH, lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, 3q26.3, SOX2 Keywords: ArrayCGH

DESIGN
Profiling of 5 advanced (stage III) lung SCC using a chromosome 3 array providing 3q26.3-q27 tiling coverage. Replicates : each array contains three replicates per clone and each sample is hybridized to two arrays, results are subsequently averaged.
