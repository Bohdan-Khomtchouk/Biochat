TITLE
p53 pulses lead to distinct patterns of gene expression albeit similar DNA-binding dynamics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of mechanism of gene regulation in response to pulses in p53 protein level induced by gamma irradiation. To directly connect p53 pulses with gene expression, we collected time-course ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data.

DESIGN
Time course p53, H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data in MCF7 cells treated with 10Gy gamma irradiation. As well as time course RNA-Seq data in MCF7 cells expressing p53shRNA.
