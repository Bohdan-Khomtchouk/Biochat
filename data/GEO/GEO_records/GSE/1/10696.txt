TITLE
Expression analysis in A431_wt vs A431_GR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A431 wild-type (wt) cancer cell line is sensitive to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). By culturing it chronically under gefitinib, it eventually becomes resistant (A431_GR cell). We know of a few proteins involved in this mechanism of drug resistance, but a cDNA exprssion array would add information to other genes that might be involved in this resistance mechanism. We used microarrays to identify the differences in the global gene expression between A431_wt (wild-type) cells and A431_GR cells. Keywords: comparison of two cell lines
