TITLE
Characterization of microRNAs of Beta macrocarpa and their responses to Beet necrotic yellow vein virus infection [miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Beta macrocarpa

SUMMARY
Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plant development, defense and abnormal disease symptom formation. Here, 547 known miRNAs, representing 129 miRNA families, and 282 potential novel miRNAs were identified in Beta macrocarpa using small RNA deep sequencing. Through a differential expression analysis, miRNAs responding to Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) infection were identified and confirmed using a microarray analysis. In total, 103 known miRNAs, representing 38 miRNA families, and 45 potential novel miRNAs were differentially regulated, with at least a two-fold change, in BNYVV-infected plants compared with the mock-inoculated control. These differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways, and enhanced axillary bud development and plant defenses. This work is the first to describe miRNAs of the plant genus Beta and may offer a reference for miRNA research in other species in the genus. It provides valuable information on the pathogenicity mechanisms of BNYVV.

DESIGN
MicroRNAs of Beta macrocarpa and their responses to Beet necrotic yellow vein virus infection was investigated using systemic leaves of BNYVV-inoculated B. macrocarpa (15 dpi) as the experimental group and healthy plants as the control group by Two-condition experiment.
