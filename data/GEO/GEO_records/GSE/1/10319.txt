TITLE
Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157 TUV93-0 to small molecule inhibitors of TTS

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli O157 treated with small molecule inhibitors of type III secretion was determined. Four variations of the small molecule inhibitor were assessed for global changes in transcription by treating cells with 20uM of inhibitor or an equivalent volume of DMSO (inhibitor solvent). Keywords: treatment, dose, Cy3, Cy5, 2-colour
