Effect of two weeks erythropoietin treatment on monocyte transcriptomes of cardiorenal patients

SUMMARY
Patients with combined heart and renal failure, also termed the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), have high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Several key connectors between heart and kidney have been recognized, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. Monocytes are key players in the development of atherosclerosis and may act as a biosensor to detect changes in the systemic environment. Anemia, which occurs frequently in CRS, is partly due to an absolute and/or relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. Until now, EPO treatment has largely been used to treat (renal) anemia, but recent research also showed beneficial non-hematopoietic effects such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative capacities. The hypothesis of the present study was that monocyte gene expression profiles of cardiorenal patients compared to healthy controls reflect the systemic nature of CRS and are responsive to short-term treatment with Epo. The first aim was to investigate whether this short term treatment revealed non-hematopoietic EPO effects. The second aim was to address whether EPO dampens expression of genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress. Given the variable response to EPO, the third aim was to test whether baseline gene expression profiles or the acute gene expression modulation by EPO are associated with EPO resistance.
