TITLE
Molecular signatures in natural-killer (NK) cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NK-cell lymphoma shares strikingly similar molecular features with a distinct subset of gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma. Gene expression profiling of NK-cell lymphoma patient samples was performed to investigate whether molecular signatures can be used to identify entities of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with NK-cell-like features.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on NK-cell maligancies to examine extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) and aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) and well-characterized cell lines of NK- and T-cell lineages to define molecular classifiers that can distinguish ENKTL from other lymphomas.
