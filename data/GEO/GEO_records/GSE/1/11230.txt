TITLE
Localization of NsrR binding sites in the Escherichia coli genome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
NsrR is a nitric oxide sensitive regulator of transcription. In Escherichia coli, NsrR is a repressor of the hmp gene encoding the flavohemoglobin that detoxifies nitric oxide.  Several other transcription units (including ytfE, ygbA and hcp-hcr) are known to be subject to regulation by NsrR.  In this study, chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis was used to identify NsrR binding sites in the chromosome of Escherichia coli strain MG1655. Keywords: ChIP-chip
