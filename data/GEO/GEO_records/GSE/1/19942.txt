TITLE
Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H in simulated microgravity

ORGANISM
Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170

SUMMARY
In the frame of the European MELiSSA project, which aims to develop a closed biological life support system for forthcoming long term space exploration missions, the study of the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H cultivated in space related environmental conditions has started. In the present work, the bacterium was grown using two different microgravity simulators, namely the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) and the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and its response was evaluated at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels using respectively a dedicated whole-genome microarray and high-througput proteomics. At the transcriptomic level, 13 genes were found significantly induced in the RWV samples and all 13 were included in the more pronounced response of 235 induced genes of R. rubrum S1H to the RPM cultivation. On the other hand, at the proteomic level, a few common proteins were found to be differentially expressed in RWV and RPM while the RWV appeared to induce a higher number of significantly regulated proteins. However, the transcriptomic and the proteomic approaches appeared to be complementary pointing out the likely interrelation between quorum sensing, cell pigmentation and cell aggregation in R. rubrum S1H. Future studies will aim to characterize this unknown quorum sensing regulon.
