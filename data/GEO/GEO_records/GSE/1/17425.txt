TITLE
Csac growth on monosaccharides found in lignocellulose

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

SUMMARY
The co-utilization of hexoses and pentoses derived from lignocellulose is an attractive trait for in microorganisms considered for consolidated biomass processing to biofuels. This issue was examined for the H2-producing, extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (Csac) growing on individual monosaccharides (arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose and xylose), mixtures of these sugars. Based on the whole-genome transcriptional response analysis and comparative genomics, carbohydrate specificities for transport systems could be proposed for most of the 24 putative carbohydrate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the C. saccharolyticus genome.  Transcriptome contrasts for monosacchride growth showed that minimal changes were observed in some cases (e.g., 31 ORFs changed > /=2-fold for glucose/galactose) while substantial changes occurred for cases involving mannose (e.g., 363 ORFs > /=2-fold for glucose/mannose). No evidence for catabolite repression was noted for either growth on multi-sugar mixtures or in the corresponding transcriptomes.
