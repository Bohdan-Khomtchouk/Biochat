TITLE
Transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22 (RNA mapping)

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
The purpose of these experiments was to determine the 5' and 3' transcriptional termini of genes on chromosomes 21-22. Towards this end, we mapped the poly A + RNA isolated from 12 normal tissues and four cell lines. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
