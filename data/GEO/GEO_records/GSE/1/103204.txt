TITLE
The comparsion of gene expression in ALVAC- and Ad5-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of different vaccine viral vectors on gene expression in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), which were generated from isolated monocytes from 3 different donors. The goal in this study was to find the difference of gene expression in human MDDCs upon ALVAC and Ad5 vrial vectors infection.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from ALVAC- and Ad5-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, which were generated from monocytes isolated from 3 different donors, at 24 hours post-infection
