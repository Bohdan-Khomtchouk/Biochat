TITLE
Quantification of vascular lineage-specific differentiation (cell type comparison)

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis have important roles in cancer progression and chronic inflammatory diseases, but efficient therapies against these diseases have been hampered by the lack of identified vascular lineage-specific markers and growth factors. Using transcriptional profiling of matched pairs of human dermal blood vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, we first identified 236 lymphatic and 342 blood vascular signature genes. In silico analyses of the biologic pathways associated with these genes revealed lineage-specific functions for each cell type. Using a selection of 85 identified vascular lineage-specific genes, we developed a TaqMan RT-PCR-based, microfluidic card-formatted low-density microvascular differentiation array (LD-MDA) that was used to reliably identify and quantify the degree of lineage-specific differentiation in different types of endothelial cells, and to detect admixture of lymphatic endothelial cells in commercial preparations of microvascular endothelial cells. Application of Prediction Relevance Ranking and analysis of variance of LD-MDA expression profiles of 43 lesional skin samples obtained from patients with the chronic inflammatory disease psoriasis led to identification of cytokines which are significantly associated with angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis in vivo. In particular, interleukin-7 and fibroblast growth factor-12 were identified as novel (lymph)angiogenic factors. This technology provides a novel tool to quantify lineage-specific vascular differentiation and to characterize (lymph)angiogenesis in clinical samples obtained from angiogenic diseases. Keywords: Quantitative real time RT-PCR, cell type comparison
