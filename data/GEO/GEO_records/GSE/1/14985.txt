TITLE
Novel Rank-Based Statistical Methods Reveal MicroRNAs with Differential Expression in Multiple Cancer Types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data collected in this study consisted of 32 paired samples of cancerous and normal origins from 14 different patients and 8 different cancer types. Each pair of samples was taken from different parts of the same tissue in the same patient - one collected and extracted from the tumor and one collected and extracted from adjacent normal tissue. One pair from each of the breast, lymphoma and prostate tissues, 2 pairs from liver and lung tissues and 3 pairs from colon, ovary and testes tissues. 2 of the ovary and testes pairs were technical replicates. We use commercial adjacent tissue tumor-normal total RNA samples purchased from Ambion/ABI. The samples were hybridized to Agilent's miRNA microarray version 2.0. Keywords: miRNA

DESIGN
For each microarray analysis, 100ng total RNAs were labeled with Cy3 per Agilent miRNA Micorarray Systems Protocol v1.5. The labeled RNA samples were hybridized onto Agilent miRNA microarray containing 799 miRNAs(Agilent Human miRNA Microarray kit, V2) for 21 hours at 55C. The arrays were then washed at room temperature and scanned to produce the hybridization signals (Agilent miRNA Micorarray Systems Protocol v1.5). The arrays were scanned with extended dynamic range at 5 and 100% PMT using the Agilent scanner (model G2565AA Technical replicate: Sample 7, Sample 29 Technical replicate: Sample 8, Sample 30 Technical replicate: Sample 19, Sample 31 Technical replicate: Sample 20, Sample 32
