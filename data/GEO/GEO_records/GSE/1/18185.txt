TITLE
Ca2+/calcineurin/CRZ1 dependent gene expression in Magnaporthe oryzae

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
The Ca2+/calcineurin signaling pathway is a central conduit regulating growth, development, and virulence of fungal pathogens infecting plants and human. We have analyzed global gene expression profiles during Ca2+ treatment in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. An immunosuppressive drug, FK506, and the knock-out mutant of a transcription factor, MoCRZ1, were included to analyze calcineurin- and/or CRZ1-dependent gene expression, respectively. About 1,400 genes were up or down regulated by Ca2+ treatment, while about 200 genes seemed to be up-regulated in a calcineurin/CRZ1-dependent manner.
