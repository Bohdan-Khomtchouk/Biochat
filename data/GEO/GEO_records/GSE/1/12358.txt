TITLE
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type fermentation time course

ORGANISM
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052

SUMMARY
The Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type culture was monitored from exponential growth to stationary phase. During this period the culture underwent a shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. Acetone and butanol production was initiated with the onset of the solventogenic phase. Using DNA microarray changes in gene expression were examined during the transitional period.
