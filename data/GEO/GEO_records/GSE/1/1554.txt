Time course of glycine addition or withdrawal

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
+Gly 20, 40, 80: Cells were grown to early log phase (OD600 ~ 0.2) at 30oC in 1 liter of minimal B medium (Cherest, H., and Surdin-Kerjan, Y. (1992) Genetics 130, 51-58) and t=0 time point samples were harvested (250 ml). The remainder of the medium was supplemented with 10 mM glycine incubated at 30oC and samples (250 ml) harvested at 20, 40 and 80 minutes. All cells were harvested by rapid centrifugation at room temperature then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. -Gly 20, 40, 80: Cells were grown to early log phase (OD600 ~ 0.2) at 30oC in 1 liter of minimal B medium (Cherest, H., and Surdin-Kerjan, Y. (1992) Genetics 130, 51-58) supplemented with 10 mM glycine and t=0 time point samples were harvested (250 ml). The remainder of the medium was filtered and the cells were rapidly resuspended in 750 ml of pre-warmed B minimal medium, incubated at 30oC and samples (250 ml) harvested at 20, 40 and 80 minutes. All cells were harvested by rapid centrifugation at room temperature then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Keywords: time-course
