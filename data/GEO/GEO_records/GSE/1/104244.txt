TITLE
Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages: 500nM Azacitidine (Aza) + 100nM ITF-2357 vs. Mock Tx.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Aza+ITF-2357 treated bone marrow derived macrophages vs. Mock treated bone marrow derived macrophages. Aim was to elucidate the effects of epigentic drug treatment on in vitro cultured macrophages and to compare these data to in vivo treated macrophage populations.

DESIGN
Two color array representation of two-condition experiment Aza+ITF-2357 treated bone marrow derived macrophages vs. Mock treated bone marrow derived macrophages. Data are single array representation of 3 pooled bone marrow derived macrophage replicates for each condition. Michael,Topper
