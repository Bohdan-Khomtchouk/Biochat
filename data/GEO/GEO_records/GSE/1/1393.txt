TITLE
A time course microarray study of gene expression in the mouse lacrimal gland after acute corneal trauma.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examine the effect of stimulation stress produced by chemical burn to the mice cornea in the lacrimal gland over a time course (0.5 - 360 hours) in comparison with the non-stimulated control animals. Using silver nitrate applicator (silver nitrate 37.5 mg and potassium nitrate 12.5 mg,  Graham-Field,Inc.,) do two burns per eye, each with a separate applicator. For animals observed for more than 24 hours, eyes were then treated with gentamicin ointment to minimize infection. Total RNA were extracted from both burn and control eyes and were covalently coupled separately with Cy5 and Cy3 monoreactive fluors. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled RNA were hybridized to the microarray. Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with ScanArray 4000XL and image intensity data were extracted and analyzed with Imagene analysis software.
