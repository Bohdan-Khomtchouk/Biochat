TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptome of the ethanol adapted yeast and control at 10% ethanol

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, using DNA microarray analysis, we compared the comprehensive expression profiles of two yeast trains, i.e, the previously obtained ethanol-adapted yeast strain and the parental strain as control (FY834), under the ethanol stress condition (YPD medium contained 10% ethanol). As a result, we identified certain genes and functional categories of the genes that are possible involved in growth under the ethanol stress condition.
