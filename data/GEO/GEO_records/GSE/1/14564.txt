TITLE
Comparison of expression in PAM765-transgenic vs GUS-transgenic Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PAM765 encodes the secretory protein of a phytopathogenic bacterium, Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris. To investigate the influence of PAM765 expression on the transcription profile of a host plant, we identified differences in the gene expression profiles between PAM765-transgenic and GUS-transgenic Arabidopsis plants using microarray analysis.
