TITLE
Heritable DNA methylation marks associated with susceptibility to breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA Methylation analysis of 210 affected and unaffected individuals from 25 Australian families with multiple cases of breast cancer without carrying a mutation at breast cancer susceptibility genes. Genome-wide methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K platform.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 210 whole blood samples was bisulfite converted and hybridised to the Infinium HumanMethylation450K (Illumina)
