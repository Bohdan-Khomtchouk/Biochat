TITLE
Gene expression profiles of lymphatic endothelial cells after knockdown of Prox1 and/or NR2F2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) isolated from human foreskin were analyzed after siRNA-mediated knockdown of control (firefly luciferase), Prox1, NR2F2 or Prox1/NR2F2 for 48 hours.
