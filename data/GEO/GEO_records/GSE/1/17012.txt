TITLE
Translocase malfunction causes extracellular protein translocation stress ( EPTS) in Streptomyces lividans

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
The genomic and proteomic analyses of Streptomyces lividans strains deficient in the major signal peptidase SipY or in the translocase complex protein SecG resulted in a set of genes being equally regulated. These genes are apparently responsible for the common deficiencies in extracellular protein production and sporulation shared by both mutant strains, constituting a cellular response to the stress caused by the potential malfunction of the translocase complex, which we have named “extracellular protein translocation stress (EPTS)”.
