TITLE
Highly purified human cord blood-derived CD34+/- hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expressions of human cord blood-derived 18Lineage-negative (18Lin-)CD34+CD38-CD133+GPI-80+ cells (CD34+ HSCs), 18Lin-CD34-CD133+GPI-80+ cells (CD34- HSCs) and 18Lin-CD34+CD133- cells (non-HSCs) were analyzed. Results provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation of human cord blood-derived CD34+/- HSCs.

DESIGN
Thirty-four to fifty thousand 18Lin-CD34+CD38-CD133+GPI-80+, 18Lin-CD34-CD133+GPI-80+ and 18Lin-CD34+CD133+ cells were isolated from human cord blood by FACS. The data were obtained from three independent experiments.
