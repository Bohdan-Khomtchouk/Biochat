TITLE
Synergy between plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and Snail in tumoral migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Snail, a family of transcriptional repressors implicated in cell movement, has been correlated with tumour invasivity. The Plasminogen Activation system (PAs), including urokinase (uPA), its receptor (uPAR), and its inhibitor (PAI-1), also plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, either through proteolytic degradation or by non proteolytic modulation of cell adhesion and migration. Thus, Snail and PAs both influence those processes and are over-expressed in cancers. In this study we aimed to determine first whether Snail activity is correlated with PAs components expression and second how this correlation can influence tumoral cell migration.
