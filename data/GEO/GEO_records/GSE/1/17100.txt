TITLE
Gene expression associated with lentiviral expression of PRAME in normal hematopoietic progenitors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression that distinguishes hematopoietic cells that express PRAME from those that do not, normal CD34+ cells with forced PRAME expression were compared to cells without PRAME expression in culture over time (days 4, 7, 14)  using Affymetrix HU-133A microarrays

DESIGN
Normal CD34+ progenitor cells not expressing PRAME were transduced with either PRAME cDNA (no 3' utr) or a corresponding empty vector control by lentiviral vector infection.  Two replicates were performed for each condition (PRAME and control) at three experimental time points (days 4, 7, and 14 in culture).   A single-stranded linear amplification protocol was used to process total RNA (one microgram) for the microarrays. This protocols is described in detail in PMID 14706461.
