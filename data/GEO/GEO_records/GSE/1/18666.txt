TITLE
Persistent heat stress in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional changes upon persistent heat stress with emphasis on epigenetically regulated genes

DESIGN
3 week old seedling grown in vitro were exposed to 37oC for 30 h (LHS). After heat stress, plants were analyzed immediately (R0) or allowed to recover at ambient temperature for 2 days (R2).
