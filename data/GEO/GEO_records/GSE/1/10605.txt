TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Ortho-Phenylphenol on Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to Ortho-Phenylphenol, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Time course
