TITLE
Genomic architecture characterizes tumor progression paths and fate in breast cancer patients

SUMMARY
Distinct molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas have been identified, but translation into clinical use has been limited. We have developed two platform independent algorithms to explore genomic architectural distortion using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data to measure 1) whole arm gains and losses (WAAI) and 2) complex rearrangements (CAAI). By applying CAAI and WAAI to data from 595 breast cancer patients we were able to separate the cases into eight subgroups with different distribution of genomic distortion. Within each subgroup data from expression analyses, sequencing and ploidy indicated that progression occurs along separate paths into more complex genotypes. Histological grade had prognostic impact only in the Luminal related groups while the complexity identified by CAAI had an overall independent prognostic power. This study emphasizes the relationship between structural genomic alterations, molecular subtype and clinical behavior, and provides a score of genomic complexity as a new tool for prognostication in breast cancer.
