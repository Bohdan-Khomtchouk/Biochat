TITLE
mutated IGHV3-23 CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of stereotyped B cell receptors (BCR), i.e. non-random combinations of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes, complementarity-determining region-3 (HCDR3), and IGV light chains, identifies discrete clusters and represents a peculiar feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Expression of IGHV3-23 characterized a CLL subset with peculiar molecular and clinical features.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mutated IGVH3-23 vs. Mutated non-IGVH3-23. Biological replicates: 22 control replicates, 5  Mutated IGVH3-23 replicates. Refrence design
