SUMMARY
Chromatin state maps (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) from partially and fully reprogrammed mouse cell lines obtained by ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc using constitutive retroviral infection of MEFs (MCV6, MCV8, MCV8.1) or induction of lentivirus in secondary B lymphocytes obtained from iPS-derived chimeric mice (BIV8). Keywords: High-throughput ChIP-sequencing, Illumina, cell type comparison
