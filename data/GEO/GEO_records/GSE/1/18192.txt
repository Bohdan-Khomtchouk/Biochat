TITLE
Genome-Wide Expression Profiling of cultured B-CLL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increased survival of primary B-CLL cells cultured in high cell density: Evidence for activation of pathways also induced by stromal cells.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of B-CLL cells before and after three different survival-inducing culture conditions: (1) stromal cell coculture [HCo], (2) stromal cell conditioned medium [CM], (3) high cell density cultures [CD]. Controls without survival-inducing culture conditions are included [0]. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from B-CLL patients.
