TITLE
Expression analysis of dendritic cells, macrophages and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles at different time points during dendritic cell differentiation (induced by specific culture conditions) including monocytes as well as expression profiles between monocytes and completely differentiated cells (macrophages at day7 and dendritic cells at day7, respectively) were compared.  Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) were obtained by culturing elutriated monocytes with 20U/ml IL-4, 280U/ml GM-CSF and 10% FCS; monocyte-derived macrophages (MAC) were obtained by culturing elutriated monocytes with 2% AB serum.

DESIGN
Three to seven biological replicates that are derived from independent healthy donors were included. One-color based gene expression. 2 datasets: dendritic cell kinetic study and comparison of monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cells
