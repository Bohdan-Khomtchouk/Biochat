TITLE
RNAseq and ChIPseq on Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells and Sorted Mesendoderm Progenitor Cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped the enhancer and long non-coding transcriptional landscape during mesendoderm specification. Mesendodermal progenitors were sorted from differentiating ESCs according to Eomes expression. Enhancer usage was coordinated with mesendoderm-specific expression of key lineage-determining transcription factors. We demonstrated that many of these enhancers are associated with the expression of lncRNAs.

DESIGN
RNA profile of mESC and sorted mesendoderm progenitors.
