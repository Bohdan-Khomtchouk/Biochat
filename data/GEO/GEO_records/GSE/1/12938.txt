TITLE
dgpp-2 DGPP-regulated genes: Identification of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate-regulated genes in ABA signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-06_dgpp - dgpp - 2.  The specific plant phosphorylated form of phosphatidic acid (PA), diacyglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), was recently shown to be a second messenger in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. The aim of the project is to identify among the set of ABA-regulated genes the ones also regulated by DGPP and/or PA.
