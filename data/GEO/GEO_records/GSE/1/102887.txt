TITLE
Hair follicles engage in chemosensation: Olfactory receptor OR2AT4 regulates human hair growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Olfactory receptors (OR) regulate physiological cell functions beyond olfaction. Here, we show that human hair follicle (HF) epithelium engages in chemosensation: it expresses OR2AT4, whose stimulation by a synthetic sandalwood odorant (prolongs hair growth (anagen) ex vivo via increased IGF-1 production. Instead, OR2AT4-silencing inhibits hair growth. Thus, human HFs can “smell” and require OR2AT4-mediated signaling to sustain their growth, inviting novel therapeutic hair growth regulation by targeting HF chemosensation.

DESIGN
4 different donors for each experiment (Vehicle untreated vs Sandalore 500μM and Scrambled oligos vs siRNA OR2AT4)
