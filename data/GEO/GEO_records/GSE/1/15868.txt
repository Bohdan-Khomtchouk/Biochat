TITLE
Expression profiling in the Drosophila eye reveals unexpected repression of Notch signaling by the JAK/STAT pathway

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Although the JAK/STAT pathway regulates numerous processes in vertebrates and invertebrates through modulating transcription, its functionally-relevant transcriptional targets remain largely unknown. With one jak and one stat (stat92E), Drosophila provides a powerful system for finding new JAK/STAT target genes. Genome-wide expression profiling on eye discs in which Stat92E is hyperactivated, revealed 584 differentially-regulated genes, including known targets domeless, socs36E and wingless. Other differentially-regulated genes (chinmo, lama, Mo25, Imp-L2, Serrate, Delta) were validated and may represent new Stat92E targets. Genetic experiments revealed that Stat92E cell-autonomously represses Serrate, which encodes a Notch ligand. Loss of Stat92E led to de-repression of Serrate in the dorsal eye, resulting in ectopic Notch signaling and aberrant eye growth there. Thus, our micro-array documents a new Stat92E target gene and a previously-unidentified inhibitory action of Stat92E on Notch signaling. These data suggest that this study will be a useful resource for the identification of additional Stat92E targets.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles from five biological replicates of eye discs with yw (control) and GMR-upd (overexpressing JAK/STAT ligand unpaired) were compared using genome wide mRNA expression profiling by Affymetrix genechip arrays (Drosophila 2.0) and key targets were validated by clonal analysis, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real-time PCR.
