SUMMARY
The metabolic impact of the common peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma isoform 2 (PPARγ2) variant Pro12Ala in human populations has been widely debated. We demonstrate using a Pro12Ala knock-in model that on chow Ala/Ala mice are leaner, have improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profiles, and longer lifespan. Gene-environment interactions played a key role as high-fat feeding eliminated the beneficial effects of the Pro12Ala variant on adiposity, plasma lipids, and insulin sensitivity. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve changes in cofactor interaction and adiponectin signaling. Altogether, our results establish the Pro12Ala variant of Pparγ2 as an important modulator in metabolic control that strongly depends on the metabolic context.
