TITLE
Profiling antibody responses to M. tuberculosis proteins in TB suspectsâ€™ sera using full-proteome microarrays.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Understanding the immune response to tuberculosis requires greater knowledge of humoral responses.  To characterize antibody targets and the effect of disease parameters on target recognition, we developed a systems immunology approach that integrated detection of antibodies against the entire Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome, bacterial metabolic and regulatory pathway information, and patient data.  Probing ~4,000 M. tuberculosis proteins with sera from > 500 suspected tuberculosis patients worldwide revealed that antibody responses recognized ~10% of the bacterial proteome.  This result defines the immunoproteome of M. tuberculosis, which is rich in membrane-associated and extracellular proteins.  Most serum reactivity during active tuberculosis focused onto ~0.5% of the proteome.  Within this pool, which is selectively enriched for extracellular proteins (but not for membrane-associated proteins), relative target preference varied among patients.  The shift in relative M. tuberculosis protein reactivity observed with active tuberculosis defines the evolution of the humoral immune response during M. tuberculosis infection and disease.
