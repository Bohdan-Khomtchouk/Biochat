TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of NF1-haploinsufficiency in human: Coriell kindred

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common monogenic tumor-predisposition disorder that arises secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Haploinsufficiency of NF1 fosters a permissive tumorigenic environment through changes in signalling between cells; however, the intracellular mechanisms for this tumor-promoting effect are less clear. We hypothesized that the genetic effects of NF1-haploinsufficiency may be discerned by comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiling in somatic, non-tumor cells (LCLs) from NF1-affected and â€“unaffected individuals.
