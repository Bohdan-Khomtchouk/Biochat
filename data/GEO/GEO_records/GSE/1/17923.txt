TITLE
Gene Expression in White Adipose Tissue of KSR2-/- mice compared to wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to define the gene expression changes that take place in the white adipose tissue of KSR2-/- mice at 6 months of age.

DESIGN
Three wild type mice and three KSR2-/- mice were used for total RNA extraction from white adipose tissue.  The RNA from each mouse was analyzed on one Affymetrix gene chip and the differences were compared using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
