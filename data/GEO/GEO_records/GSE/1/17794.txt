TITLE
Expression data from B6C3F1 mice treated with 2-butoxyethanol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were dosed  with 2-BE (900mg/kg) or vehicle by oral gavage and sacrificied either after 4 hours of a single dose or after 7 days of daily dosing.

DESIGN
Mice were euthanased by cervical dislocation under ketamine / acepromazine (100 mg/kg / 5 mg/kg, I.P) anesthesia. The bone marrow from the right humerus, a portion of the left lateral liver lobe and half a cross-section of the spleen were harvested and the RNA was isolated from these tissues using standard Qiagen reagents. Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for GeneChip probe preparations. 44 arrays.
