TITLE
miR-140 deficiency effect on the chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse chondrocytes lacking the microRNA-140. MicroRNAs are genomically encoded small RNAs to regulate the gene expression. miR-140 shows high expression in cartilage. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-140 function in chondrocytes. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. RNA samples collected from cultured rib chondrocytes of wild-type and miR-140-/- to identify potential mRNA targets of miR-140. 2 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II and second strand cDNA was synthesized. Biotinylated antisense cRNAs was amplified and transcribed using the GeneChip expression 3’-Amplification reagent (Affymetrix). Finally, 10 µg of cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized to GeneChip (R) Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix). Microarray data were summarized by Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method and statistical analysis was performed using NIA Array Analysis ( ).
