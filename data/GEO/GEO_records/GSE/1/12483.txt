TITLE
Anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment of Rat Hippocampal Slice Cultures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The neurite outgrowth inhibitory myelin protein Nogo-A has been well studied in the context of central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease. We studied the effects of the application of neutralizing anti-Nogo-A antibodies (11C7 and 7B12) in intact CNS tissue in vitro using rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. This study had the purpose of elucidating the role of Nogo-A in the adult intact CNS and determining the consequences of its neutralization through antibody application. In vitro cultures treated with anti-Nogo-A antibody showed an elicited growth response. The results also gave indications that hippocampal circuitry might be altered due to the regulation at the synaptic and neurotransmission level.
