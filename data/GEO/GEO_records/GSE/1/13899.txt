TITLE
Quercetin supplementation and CD14+ monocyte gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Quercetin has been described to have a wide range of beneficial effects in humans, ranging from anti-carcinogenic properties to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. We tested whether a daily supplementation of quercetin leads to reproducible changes in gene expression profiles of human monocytes. Keywords: individual compound treatment
