TITLE
Involvement of 4E-BP1 in the protection induced by HDLs on pancreatic beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect pancreatic β cells against apoptosis. This property might be related to the increased risk to develop diabetes in patients with low HDL blood levels. However, the mechanisms by which HDLs protect β cells are poorly characterized. Here we use a transcriptomic approach to identify genes differentially modulated by HDLs in β cells subjected to apoptotic stimuli.

DESIGN
Tested conditions on beta-TC3 cells for 6h (in triplicates for each condition; GSK3 and GSK4 indicate two independent HDL preparations): Complete Medium + Vehicle [V] Complete Medium + HDL (prep. HDL GSK3 or HDL GSK4) [HDL] Starvation medium + Vehicle [V.S] Starvation medium + HDL (prep. HDL GSK3 or HDL GSK4) [HDL.S]
