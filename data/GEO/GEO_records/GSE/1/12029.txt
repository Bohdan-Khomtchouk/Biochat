TITLE
NFYA5, a CCAAT binding transcription factor important for drought resistance in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
NFYA5 is a transcription factor important for drought resistance.  Drought stress up-regulates NFYA5 gene expression not only at the transcriptional level but also at the posttranscriptional level by down-regulating the expression of miR169a that targets NFYA5 transcript for cleavage.
