TITLE
SNP array genomic profiling of PTCL NOS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA extracted from frozen tissue of 47 peripheral T-cell lymphomas–not otherwise specified [PTCL-NOS] was hybridized to 250k StyI SNP arrays

DESIGN
47 PTCL NOS compared to healthy reference DNA. DNA of PTCL NOS was extracted from frozen tissue blocks, DNA of healthy individual was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Array hybridization was performed according to manufacturer´s protocol.
