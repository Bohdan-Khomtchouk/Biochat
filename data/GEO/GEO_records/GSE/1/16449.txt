TITLE
Molecular Stratification of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Reveals Distinct Subtypes and Survival Patterns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors express varying gene profiles, dependent on varying genetic events. Here we analyzed a series of ccRCC tumors to show that two subtypes of  ccRCC exist based on their molecular signature. These subtypes (ccA and ccB) are identifiable by a robust set of genes representing distinct biological pathways and are correlated with patient survival post-nephrectomy. Keywords: Patient sample study

DESIGN
RNA from 48 clear cell RCC tumors specimens and 18 corresponding non-tumor samples was hybridized against a modified commercial reference RNA (Perou CM, Sorlie T, Eisen MB, et al. Molecular portraits of human breast tumours. Nature 2000;406:747â€“752) for gene expression analysis.
