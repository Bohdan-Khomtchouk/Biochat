TITLE
Mutant analysis of C. elegans small RNAs with 5p monophosphates

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These datasets profile the expression of small RNAs with 5p monophosphates and 3p hydroxyls (including miRNAs, 21U-RNAs) in young adult worms from the wt, prg-1 mutant, and fog-2 mutant backgrounds. These datasets were prepared in the Craig C. Mello laboratory using T4 RNA ligase 1. Keywords: miRNA and 21U-RNA discovery and mutant expression profiling
