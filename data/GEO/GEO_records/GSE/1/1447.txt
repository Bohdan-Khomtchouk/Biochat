SUMMARY
The SAGE libraries were built from total mRNA populations in specific tissues, cells, mutation-specific populations, and all developmental stages of C. elegans.  Tissue- and cell-specific libraries were generated from FACS-sorted cells marked by expression of specific promoter::GFP fusions Keywords = SAGE Keywords = LongSAGE Keywords = Caenorhabditis elegans Keywords = development Keywords = dauer Keywords: other
