TITLE
Circular RNA profile of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a widespread class of non-coding RNAs, which drew little attention in the past. Recently, limited data showed their promising future to act as biomarkers in human cancer, but the characteristics and functions remain largely unknown in human cervical cancer. In this study,  we demonstrated the expression profile of circRNAs in cervical squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) patients with circRNA microarray, and identified a large number of circRNAs possibly expressed in SCC.

DESIGN
5 cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissues and 5 paired-paracancerous cervical tissuses.
