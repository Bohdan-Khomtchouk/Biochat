TITLE
Host cell transcripts during malaria liver stage infection reveals a coordinated and sequential set of biological events

ORGANISM
Plasmodium yoelii

SUMMARY
After entering their mammalian host via the bite of an Anopheles mosquito, Plasmodium sporozoites migrate to the liver where they traverse several hepatocytes before invading the one inside which they will develop and multiply into thousands of merozoites. Although this constitutes an essential step in malaria infection, the requirements of Plasmodium parasites in liver cells and how they use the host cell for their own survival and development are poorly understood. To gain new insights into the molecular host-parasite interactions that take place during malaria liver infection, we have used high-throughput microarray technology to determine the transcriptional profile of P. yoelii-infected hepatocytes that were collected from P. yoelii-infected mice 24 and 40 h after infection. This in vivo microarray expression was compared with the microarray analysis of in vitro infected hepatoma cells infected with closely related rodent malaria parasite P. berghei. Differential expression patterns for host genes  identify genes and pathways involved in the host response to rodent Plasmodium parasites. Keywords: gene expression
