SUMMARY
[original Title] Comparison of expression data of primary murine melanocytes from aryl hydrocarbon deficient mice and corresponding wild-type C57BL/6 mice Melanin is produced exclusively by melanocytes and melanogenesis is the vital response to protect skin cells against Ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced DNA damage. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor, which may be involved in the physiological tanning response. Normal murine melanocytes express functional AhR. We tested gene expression in WT versus AhR-deficient mice primary murine melanocytes, isolated from the skin and cultivated for several passages.
