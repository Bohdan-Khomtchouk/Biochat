TITLE
Rat lung cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat somatic lung cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave the rat somatic lung cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the rat iPS cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between rat somatic lung cells and rat iPS cells.
