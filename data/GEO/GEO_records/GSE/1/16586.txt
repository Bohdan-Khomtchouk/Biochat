TITLE
miRNA expression in human tracheal smooth muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed miRNA expression in intact airway smooth muscle tissue to evaluate candidate miRNA for further studies.  We found 60 miRNA expressed at a detectable level in all four donors and another 118 miRNA expressed in three of the four donors.  There were 18 miRNAs with expression levels > 2-fold above normalized expression values.  These consisted of 12 described human miRNA, including let-7c, miR-16, -23b, -24, -26a, -125b, -143, -145, -200c and -205; 3 mouse miRNAs including miR-99a, -140* and -370; and 3 novel miRNA termed abi-13143, -13232 and -13268.
