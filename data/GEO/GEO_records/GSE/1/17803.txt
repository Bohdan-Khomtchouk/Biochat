TITLE
Gene expression dissection of the circadian neuronal circuit of Drosophila identifies novel circadian genes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of distinct members of a neuronal circuit has the potential to   identify candidate molecules and mechanisms that underlie the formation, organization   and function of the circuit. To this end, we report here the application of a novel method   to characterize RNAs from small numbers of specific Drosophila brain neurons, which   belong to the circadian circuit. We identified three different sets of mRNAs enriched in   different subclasses of clock neurons:  one is enriched in all clock neurons, a second is   enriched in PDF-positive clock neurons and a third is enriched in PDF-negative clock   neurons.  Moreover, we characterized 2 novel genes, Fer2 and dnocturnin, one from each   subgroup, which highlight subgroup-specific features and play important roles in   circadian rhythms. The methodology is a powerful tool not only to dissect the cellular   and molecular basis of circadian rhythms but also to molecularly characterize other   Drosophila neuronal circuits.

DESIGN
Circadican related neuronal celltypes (Tim, Pdf) or general neurons (Elav) were labeled by GFP or YFP using specific Gal4 drivers. Expression of those celltypes were profiled after manual sorting of those GFP or YFP positive cells. 3 biological replicates were collected (except adult small pdf cells).
