TITLE
Effect of hypoxia on gene expression in Grey poplar

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
The molecular responses of Grey poplar (Populus x canescens) following root hypoxia were studied in roots and leaves using transcript profiling. Grey poplar is a flooding tolerant tree species and analysis of the molecular response to hypoxia may indicate possible adaptation mechanisms to this stress.
