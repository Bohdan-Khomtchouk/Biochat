TITLE
The effect of PPARa siRNA on endothelial cells treated with fenofibrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fenofibrate is a synthetic ligand for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, but there are reports that fenofibrate affects endothelial cells in PPARa-independent manner. In order to identify PPARa-dependently and PPARa-independently regulated transcripts we generated microarray data from human endothelial cells treated with fenofibrate with and without siRNA-mediated knock-down of PPARa.
