TITLE
smRNAs in wildtype and RDR6-15 knockout Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 leaf

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This set consists of small RNAs sequenced from two replicates of wildtype and two replicates of RDR6-15 knockout Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 leaf samples. RDR6 is required for the production of tasRNAs (trans-acting small RNAS) and so tags associated with the tasRNA loci should be severely down-regulated or absent in the knockout compared to wildtype. The set can thus be used as containing known true positives for testing differential expression detection methods.

DESIGN
Examination of smRNA in 2 replicates wildtype and 2 replicates RDR6-15 knockout
