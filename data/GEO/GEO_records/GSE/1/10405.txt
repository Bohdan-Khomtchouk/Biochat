SUMMARY
Oxaliplatin is a member of the family of Pt-containing chemotherapeutic agents that also include cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin. OXA is distinguished from these two older drugs by its different spectrum of activity both in preclinical models and in clinical trials. It is the only platinum analogue to have activity in colon cancer, a disease for which this drug has now become a mainstay of therapy. It mainly forms intrastrand adducts between two adjacent guanine residues or guanine and adenine, disrupting DNA replication and transcription. OXA has been reported to be involved in the Nucleotide Excision Repair Pathway (NER), p38 kinase activation, PI3K/AKT pathway and caspases cascade activation through apoptotic intrinsic pathway. However, the downstream molecular events underlying the cytotoxic effects of this chemotherapeutic agent have not been well characterized. This study was developed in order to clarify the multifactoriality of the resistance acquisition process and to identify genes and pathways that could play a role as markers in OXA sensitivity.
