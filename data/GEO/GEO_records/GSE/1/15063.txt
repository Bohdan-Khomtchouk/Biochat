TITLE
bac2 mutant transcriptome modification during osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs08-05_bac2 - bac2-catma - We are studying the function of a gene encoding a mitochondrial basic amino acid carrier , BAC2 in Arabdopsis thaliana.This gene is expressed during osmotic and salt stresses, and dark-induced senescence. We wish to determine whether there are transcriptome modifications during osmotic stress in mutant plants (bac2) compared to wild-type plants . - Mutant and Wild-type plants were grown on grids for 7 days on plates containing MS/2 and saccharose. Plants were transferred for 24h to liquid medium containing MS/2 saccharose (untreated plants) or 0.4M mannitol MS/2 saccharose (treated plants). Keywords: gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison,wt vs mutant comparison

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
