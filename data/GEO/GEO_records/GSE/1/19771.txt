TITLE
Neonat cardiomyocytes_hypertrophy_HDAC4

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to identify targets for HDAC4, NRVM were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding beta-Galactosidase or Flag- HDAC4, and incubated in serum free or 10% fetal calf serum containing growth medium for 48 hrs.

DESIGN
NRVM were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding beta-Galactosidase (control) or Flag- HDAC4 (experiment), and incubated in serum free or 10% fetal calf serum containing growth medium for 48 hrs. 2 biological samples of each condition were analyzed.
