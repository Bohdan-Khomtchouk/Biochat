TITLE
Transcriptome uterus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
cDNA microarrays were used to identify the expression of the genes in uterus by comparison with two others regions of the oviduct not involved in the shell deposition. A total of 605 sequences specifically over-expressed were revealed. The expression of 15 of them was also confirmed using qRT-PCR, and confirmed the microarray expression. The 605 uterine transcripts corresponded to 469 and 437 different genes and proteins respectively. A global interpretation of their functions was assessed using the Gene Ontology terms and the most over-represented terms are relative to the mineral transport and transfer necessary to the calcification process. The study has revealed 53 proteins which could be secreted to be deposited in the shell to be biologically actives. The study of their functions reveals proteins known for their involvement in the biomineralization or with calcium binding properties to interact with the mineral phase during the eggshell fabric. A large group of proteins could be involved in the folding of the matrix, and a notable group of uterine secreted proteins was also identified as antibacterial to contribute to the antimicrobial protection of the egg. Finally the study revealed proteases and protease inhibitors which could play an active role in the regulation of the protein activities in the acellular uterine fluid where the eggshell is formed.

DESIGN
A balanced block hybridization design (Dye switch) was used where half of the samples were labelled with Alexa® 555 fluorescent dye and the other half with Alexa® 647. A total of 16 microarray slides were used for hybridization to 32 samples that correspond to four tissue contrast (uterus versus magnum and uterus versus white isthmus).
