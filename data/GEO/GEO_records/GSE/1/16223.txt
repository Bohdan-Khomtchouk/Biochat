TITLE
Prionic protein gene dosage is critical for maintenance of neuronal homeostasis of hippocampal circuits

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that Prnp dosage is critical for the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis since both its absence and, more relevantly, its overexpression induce higher sensitivity to kainate (KA) damage. These data correlate with electrophysiological results in freely behaving mutant mice showing an imbalance in activity-dependent synaptic processes, as determined from input/output curves, paired-pulse facilitation, and LTP studies. Gene expression profiling showed that 129 genes involved in canonical pathways such as Ubiquitination or Neurotransmission among  others were co-regulated in knockout and PrPc overexpressing mice. RT-qPCR  analysis of neurotransmission-related genes confirmed GABA-A and AMPA-Kainate  receptor subunit transcriptional co-regulation in both Prnp -/- and Tg20 mice. Our results demonstrate that PrPc is necessary for the proper homeostatic functioning of hippocampal circuits, because of its interactions with GABAA and AMPA-Kainate  receptors.

DESIGN
We performed a global transcriptome analysis of three strains that differ in their Prnp gene dose using Illumina Sentrix 6 mouse v1.1 beadarrays. We analyzed mRNA expression in the hippocampi of four individual male mice from each of three strains: 1) Tg20, with a 30 exogenous copies of the Prnp gene within a Prnp -/- background that overexpresses PrPc about 6-7 times the normal wild type levels; 2) littermates lacking the transgene and therefore carrying only the homozygous knock out Prnp -/- strain  which lacks expression of PrPc; and 3) their wild type counterparts carrying two copies of the intact Prnp gene and expressing normal levels of PrPc
