TITLE
Gene expression analysis of glioblastoma spheroid cultures II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in 10 glioblastoma spheroid cultures compared to a non-neoplastic spheroid culture isolated from the bulbus olfactorius

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 10 glioblastoma spheroid cultures was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 17 093  transcripts, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes compared to a  non-neoplastic brain spheroid culture
