TITLE
RNA-seq of regenerating blastema cells in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have carried out eukaryotic whole-genome Illumina RNA-seq of regenerating blastema cells and control undamaged wing imaginal disc cells to identify the differentially expressed genes during regeneration.

DESIGN
Ablated sample vs. Control, 3 biological replicates for each
