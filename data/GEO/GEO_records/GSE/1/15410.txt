TITLE
AB* zebrafish embryos exposed to 1 ng/mL TCDD from 1d to 5d post-fertilization.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of the response to dioxin in developing zebrafish embryos, at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-fertilization. The goal was to elucidate mechanisms by which dioxin causes toxicity in zebrafish; this dose was previously shown to induce teratogenesis.
