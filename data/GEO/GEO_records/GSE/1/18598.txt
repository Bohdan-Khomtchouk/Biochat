TITLE
Differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes, introduced with siRNA against aof2 and rfk genes, or treated with tranylcypromine

SUMMARY
Adipogenic differentiation and metabolic adaptation are initiated through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. In particular, dynamic changes in histone modifications may play central roles in the rearrangement of gene expression patterns. LSD1 (KDM1) protein, encoded by aof2 gene, is a histone demethylase, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. Since the enzymatic activity of LSD1 is FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide)-dependent, its effects on gene expression may be influenced by FAD availability. To address the importance of histone demethylation in adipogenic differentiation and function, we performed cDNA microarray in LSD1-deficient 3T3-L1 cells as well as in the cells treated with LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine (TC). FAD-synthesizing enyme, riboflavin kinase (RFK) -deficient cells were also subjected to the microarray analysis.

DESIGN
3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with  aof2- or rfk- specific siRNA or control siRNA (siGL3) . 24 hours later, cells were subjected to adipogenic induction. 24 hours later, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction. For the TC treatment, TC was added to the adipogenic induction medium.
