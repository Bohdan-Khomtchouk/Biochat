TITLE
Single cell RNA Seq data of BMDM from mouse infected with Salmonella [dilution]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-Seq method (scDual-Seq) that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes and use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we found three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.

DESIGN
a dilution series of mouse and salmonella RNA
