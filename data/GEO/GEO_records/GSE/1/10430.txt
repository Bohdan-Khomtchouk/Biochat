TITLE
MyoD-/-, Time Course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myogenic Primary Myoblast Time Course in vitro Differentiation into Myotubes for Ontario Genome Project 2004-05. The Differentiation is leaded by removing the Proliferation Medium (Ham's F10 Medium + growth factors) and feeding with Differentiation Medium (DMEM hg + 2.5% Horse serum). The expected data are: % Viability of cells; Total RNA extraction; BioAnalysis and MicroArray of Undifferentiated and Differentiated cells. Time course: 0 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days. Note that the Triplicate1 sample = MyoD-/-1999; Triplicate 2 sample = MyoD-/-p6; Triplicate 3 sample = MyoD-/-p10.
