SUMMARY
A novel method for detecting genome-wide ASM (allele-specific methylation) was developed by modification of the Affymetrix 250K StyI SNP arrays. Using this method, and the above mentioned samples, we consistently detected ASM in non-imprinted regions of the genome. Interestingly, ASM appears to be strongly correlated with the SNP sequences in cis.
