TITLE
Preâ€“and Post-training arrays/Insulin sensitivity response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment designed to identify differences in gene expression patterns in previously sedentary individuals before an endurance exercise training program. This series compares 2 groups of individuals that display high and low insulin sensitivity (SI) response (HSIR and LSIR) after 20 weeks of exercise (a 4-fold difference in SI response).  There were no differences before training for SI, sex, age, BMI or body fat in the individuals integrating the LSIR and HSIR groups. Keywords = skeletal muscle Keywords = exercise-training Keywords = insulin sensitivity Keywords: repeat sample
