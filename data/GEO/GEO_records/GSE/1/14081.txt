Hybrid_Poplar_H11-11_Leaves_Local_Stress_Response_DataSet3

ORGANISM
Populus

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x deltoides) leaves to a variety of stress treatments (insect feeding by Malacosoma disstria larvae, mechanical wounding, wounding plus the application of insect oral secretions, and methyl jasmonate spray) over a 24 hour time course. Experiments were conducted using clonal trees under greenhouse conditions at the University of British Columbia. We used the 15.5K poplar cDNA microarray platform previously described by Ralph et al. (Molecular Ecology 2006, 15:1275-1297). Differentially expressed genes were determined using three criteria: fold-change between treated and untreated control leaves > 1.5-fold, P value < 0.05 and Q value < 0.05. This study identified > 1,000 differentially expressed genes in response to insect feeding and/or treatments that mimic insect feeding damage.
