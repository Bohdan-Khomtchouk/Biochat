TITLE
Expression data from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (FA19)

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Naturally occurring mtrR mutants of gonococci displaying clinically relevant levels of antibiotic resistance are often isolated from patients and mtrR mutants have been reported to be more fit than the wild type parent strain in a murine vaginal infection model. DNA-binding proteins, such as MtrR, that negatively regulate bacterial efflux pump genes have been considered to be “local” gene regulators, although there is increasing evidence that they can directly or indirectly influence expression of other genes. To define the regulatory properties of MtrR we employed microarray analysis of isogenic MtrR-positive and MtrR-negative gonococci. Keywords: single time point
