TITLE
MNNG treated Excherichia coli reveal new up or down regulated genes belonging to the Ada regulon

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
An oligonucleotide tiling array technology is utilized to measure the entire Escherichia coli transcriptome and its transcriptional changes after induction of the adaptive response by the alkylating agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Keywords: Gene expression during the adaptive response in Escherichia coli
