TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of BA- or BL- associated murine colonic epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A huge number of microorganisms are colonized in human gut and the balance of their composition is closely related to human health. Recently, many probiotics such as bifidobacteria or lactobacilli have been introduced in our life as effective agents. However, we have not well understood their beneficial mechanisms including host-bacterial crosstalk To analyze the differences of gene expression between BA- or BL-associated murine colonic epithelium, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis.
