TITLE
Stress-induced changes in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome analyzed using whole genome tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant responses to abiotic stresses are accompanied by massive changes in transcriptome composition. To provide a comprehensive view of stress-induced changes in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome, we have used whole-genome tiling arrays to analyze the effects of salt, osmotic, cold and heat stress as well as application of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), an important mediator of stress responses.
