SUMMARY
In bacteria, two-component regulatory system (TCSs) is generally characterized by a simple phosphotransfer scheme, composed of a sensor domain (a histidine kinase) and a  response domain (a response regulator), which is responsible for detection of external stimuli. PhoP-PhoQ TCS of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a causal agent of bacterial leaf blight disease in rice, was previously shown to be negatively regulated by RaxR-RaxH, another TCS that senses population cell density as well as modulates the activity of AvrXA21,  a bacterial effector, recognized by a bacterial blight resistance gene, Xa21. In this work, whole-genome microarray was performed to analyze transcription profiling and identify member of PhoP regulon under Mg2+ and Ca2+ limited condition. This analysis revealed that PhoP governs broad cellular pathways including stress defense response, cation transportation, general metabolism, broad regulatory system, bacterial motility, and bacterial virulence. Array results provide a set of candidate genes, further biochemical pathway analysis, and signaling pathway crosstalks that need to be characterized to understand PhoP-dependent mechanisms and also suggest a putative regulatory loop between two phoP-phoQ and raxR-raxH TCSs. Implication of this analysis suggested that Xoo adopt PhoP-PhoQ system to perceive extracellular signals from certain environment such as low concentration of metal ions, and to regulate intracellular signals of other regulatory systems.
