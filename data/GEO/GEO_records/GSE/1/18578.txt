SUMMARY
We report the application of single molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput mapping of CFP1, RNA polymerase II and H3K4me3 in mouse brain. By obtaining sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide binding / chromatin-state maps for mouse brain. We find a good correlation between CFP1 binding and H3K4me3 consistent with it presence in the SetD1 histone methylatransferase complex. Mapped RNA polymerase II colocalised with the majority of CFP1 / H3K4me3 positive CpG islands but not all. This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of the genome wide distribution of a previously uncharacaterised DNA binding factor and suggests a link between DNA base composition and chromatin state.
