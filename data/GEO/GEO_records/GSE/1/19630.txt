TITLE
Genetic markers of the immune response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Infectious diseases among fish present an important economic burden for the aquaculture and fisheries industries around the world. For example, the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is known to infect farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and results in millions of dollars of lost revenue to salmon farmers. Although improved management and husbandry practices over the last few years have minimized the losses and the number of outbreaks, the risk of new virulent isolates emerging is still a looming threat to the viability and sustainability of this industry. An understanding of the host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level during the course of an infection thus remains of strategic importance for the development of molecular tools and efficient vaccines capable of minimizing losses in the eventual case of a new outbreak.  Using a 32 k cDNA microarray platform (cGRASP), we have studied various signaling pathways and immune regulated genes, activated or repressed, in Atlantic salmon head-kidney during the course of an ISAV infection. Gene expressions were measured at 5 different time-points: 6h, 24h, 3d, 7d and 16d post infection to get an overall view of changes as they occurred in time. The earliest time points showed only a few differentially expressed genes in infected fish, relative to controls, although as time progressed, many additional genes involved in key defense pathways were up-regulated including MHC type I, beta-2 microglobulin, TRIM 25 and CC-chemokine 19. During the latest stage of the infection process, many genes related to oxygen transportation were under-expressed, which correlates well with the anemia observed prior to death in Atlantic salmon infected with virulent strains of ISAV.
