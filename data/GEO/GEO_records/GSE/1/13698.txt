TITLE
12 microarrays for cis-DCE mineralization and new stress genes

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Metabolically-engineered Escherichia coli has been used previously to degrade the ubiquitous pollutant cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE), and the impact of the metabolic engineering was assessed by investigating the changes in the proteome.  Here, genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed to confirm that a strong heat shock and/or oxidative stress occurs during enhanced cis-DCE mineralization. Also, seven new stress proteins (YchH, YdeI, YodD, YodC, YgiW, YhcN, and YjaA) that were previously uncharacterized have been identified.
