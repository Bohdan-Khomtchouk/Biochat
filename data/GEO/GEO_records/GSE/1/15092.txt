TITLE
The effects of PTIP on Polycomb mediated repression in Drosophila Kc167 cells.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Kc167 cells were used to test the function of PTIP in regulating gene expression before and after loss of polycomb function.  Four condtions were tested using dsRNA knockdowns (RNAi)

DESIGN
Kc167 cells alone, Kc cells with loss of PTIP, cells with loss of polycomb and polyhomeotic, and cells with loss of PTIP, polycomb, and polyhomeotic. Performed in triplicate.
