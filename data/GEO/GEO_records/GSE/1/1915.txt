TITLE
CEA_SGF:E00014#HU_response_long-term

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of long-term response to hydroxyurea in a yeast wild-type strain (CDY59). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium containong 200 mM hydroxyurea (HU) during the indicated time (1, 2, 4 or 6 hours). Gene expression changes were analysed compared to the same strain grown in the same medium without HU. Keywords: time-course
