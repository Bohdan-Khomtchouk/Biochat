TITLE
Effects of labelling fetal MSC with MRI Particles: MGIO and Ferucarbotran

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell tracking is enabled by incubating ex vivo cells with commercially/clinically available MRI particulate label, such as ferucarbotran. However, the uptake by non-phagocytic cells, such as mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is poor, and the detection by MRI is impeded. MGIO is a new label that is efficiently taken up by MSC. The proliferation and differentiation capacity of labelled cells are usually assessed to determine cytotoxicity. In this study, we compared the global gene expression profiles of mock-labelled, ferucarbotran-labelled and MGIO-labelled fetal MSC.
