TITLE
Global transcriptomic response of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni upon exposure to serum

ORGANISM
Leptospira interrogans

SUMMARY
L. interrogans, a causative agent of leptospirosis, can survive in the environment for lengthy periods of time in between infection of mammalian hosts.  In order to identify genes involved in survival in the early spirochetemic phase of infection, we performed a transcriptional analysis of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni upon exposure to serum in comparison with EMJH medium.

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA derived from serum- and EMJH-treated L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni as experimental and control samples, respectively.  The samples were composed of 3 biological replicates with dye swap for each replicate, resulting in 6 arrays.  Direct comparisons were made between arrays of experimental and control samples using raw data pulled from two different channels for data analysis.
