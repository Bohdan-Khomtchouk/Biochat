TITLE
Identification of StpA-binding sites on the Salmonella genome

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-chip analysis to identify where the nucleoid associated protein StpA binds on the Salmonella Typhimurium genome. We identified 285 chromosomal regions bound by StpA, ranging in size from 400 to 3500 base pairs and containing 572 genes. Comparison of the ChIP data revealed that StpA displayed an identical binding profile to H-NS; all genomic regions associated with StpA were also bound by H-NS. Of the 88 StpA-dependent genes that are de-repressed in the absence of StpA, only 25 were bound by StpA, suggesting that StpA generally regulates gene expression indirectly.
