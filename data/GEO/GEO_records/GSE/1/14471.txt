TITLE
Affymetrix U133A array data for 111 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples at diagnosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of Copy Number Alterations (CNA) and Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), gene expression and resequencing of pediatric AML This study characterizes CNA and LOH, gene expression and gene sequence mutations in a representative cross-section through subtypes of pediatric AML. Keywords: Affymetrix arrays were performed according to the maufacturers directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Samples with less than 80% blasts were flow sorted prior to DNA extraction
