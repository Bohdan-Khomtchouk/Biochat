TITLE
Lubiprostone effects on small intestinal gene expression in wild type and Cftr-null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that impair function of this cAMP-regulated Cl- channel. In the small intestine, loss of CFTR function creates a dehydrated, acidic luminal environment which is believed to cause an accumulation of mucus, a phenotype characteristic of CF. CF mice have an innate immune response and impaired intestinal transit as well. We investigated whether lubiprostone, which activates the CLC2 Cl- channel, would improve the CF intestinal phenotype. Methods: Cftrtm1UNC (CF) and wildtype (WT) littermate mice on the C57BL/6 background were used. Lubiprostone (10ug/kg-day) was administered by gavage for two weeks. Mucus accumulation was estimated from crypt lumen widths in Carnoy's-fixed, PAS/AB stained sections. Luminal bacterial load was measured by qPCR for the bacterial 16S gene. Gastric emptying and small intestinal transit were assessed by gavage of rhodamine dextran. Gene expression was evaluated by Affymetrix Mouse430 2.0 microarray. Results: Crypt width in control CF mice was 700% that of WT mice (P < 0.001). Lubiprostone did not affect WT crypt width but, unexpectedly, increased CF crypt width 22% (P=0.001). Lubiprostone increased bacterial load in WT mice to 490% of WT control levels (P=0.008). Conversely, lubiprostone decreased bacterial overgrowth in CF mice by 60% (P=0.005). Lubiprostone significantly increased gastric emptying at 20 min postgavage in both WT (P < 0.001; control=57±3%, treated=81±4%) and CF mice (P < 0.001; control=48±4%, treated=75±5%). After lubiprostone small intestinal transit was significantly enhanced in WT mice (P=0.024) but the effect was not significant in CF mice (P=0.377). Among other innate immune markers, expression of mast cell genes was elevated ~20-fold in the control CF intestine and lubiprostone decreased expression to WT control levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that lubiprostone has some benefits for the CF intestinal phenotype, especially on bacterial overgrowth and the innate immune response. The unexpected observation of increased mucus accumulation in the crypts of lubiprostone-treated CF mice suggests the possibility that lubiprostone increases mucus secretion.

DESIGN
For each group (control wild type n=10, lubiprostone-treated wild type n=7, control Cftr null n=10 , and lubiprostone-treated cftr null n=8), total RNA was extracted from the entire small intestine and equal amounts were pooled for analysis.
