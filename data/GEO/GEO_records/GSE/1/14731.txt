TITLE
Expression profile between internodes 1 and 9 from high and low brix plants for sucrose content

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
The expression profile of mature internodes (In9) and immature (In1) internodes of high brix and low brix plants was compared. Internodes were collected from plants with high brix content and from plants with low brix content from Progeny 2. Progeny 2 was derived from a cross between two commercial varieties (SP80-180 x SP80-4966). Five hundred sugarcane F1 plants were field-grown. The stem sugar content from the different plants showed a normal distribution, and seven plants with extreme brix values were collected 7 and 11 months after planting. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
