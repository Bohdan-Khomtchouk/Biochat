TITLE
Temporal ChIP-on-Chip of RNA-Polymerase-II to detect novel gene activation events during photoreceptor maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase-II active regions were mapped comparing mouse neural retina tissue at age P25 and P2 to find novel gene activation predictions during maturation of photoreceptors. Over 800 predictions of increased activation were novel compared to previous mRNA expression array studies.

DESIGN
P2 and P25 mouse neural retina (C57BL6) ChIP'ed with anti-RNA-Pol-II, P25 ChIP'ed with anti-FIZ1, all normalized to input genomic DNA control. Promoter Tiling Array 1.0
