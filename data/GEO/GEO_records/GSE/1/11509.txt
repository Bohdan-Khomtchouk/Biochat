TITLE
comparison of virulence factors and expression of specific genes of UPEC and APEC in vivo and in vitro

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To gain further information of the correlation and pathogenisis of UPEC and APEC, the in vivo expression of 152 specific genes in both murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model and chicken challenge model were compared to that of UPEC U17 and APEC E058 grown statically to exponential phase in rich medium, respectively.
