TITLE
Expression data from rapamycin treatment and/or p73 knock-down in Rh30 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p73 is a p53 family transcription factor that plays critical roles during development and tumor suppression.  We analyzed p73 activity using a combination of ChIP-on-Chip and gene expression profiling, both at baseline and after treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. We generated an mTOR-p73 gene signature that predicts rhabdomyosarcoma tumor subtype and patient outcome, and is enriched for p73 target genes involved in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells were infected with lentivirus (either control or expressing one of two RNAi constructs targeting p73) for 3 d, and treated with vehicle or 40 nM rapamycin for 24 h, and then total RNA was harvested.  Experiments were performed in duplicate for a total of 8 samples.  For p73 RNAi, a different targeting construct was used for each replicate.
