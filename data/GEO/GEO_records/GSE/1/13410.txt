TITLE
Mechanism and transcriptional program of YB-1 in breast cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YB-1 controls epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by restricting translation of growth-related mRNAs and enabling expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors. We used microarrays to characterize the direct transcriptional and indirect translational regulation of mRNAs by exogenous YB-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Keywords: gene expression profiling
