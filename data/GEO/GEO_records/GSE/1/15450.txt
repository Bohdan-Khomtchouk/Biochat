TITLE
Small regulatory RNA in the bovine genome

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA and other types of small regulatory RNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Several distinct classes of small regulatory RNAs have been discovered in recent years. To extend the repertoire of small regulatory RNAs characterized in mammals and identify miRNA expressed upon viral infection we used Illuminaâ€™s ultrahigh throughput sequencing approach. Results presented in this study extend our knowledge of the biology and evolution of small regulatory RNAs in mammals and illuminate mechanisms of small RNA biogenesis and function. Keywords: Transcriptome analysis
