TITLE
Expression data for melanoma short-term cultures and cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the gene expression levels from 8 melanoma short-term cultures and 1 melanoma cell line in order to compare to expression level estimates obtained by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Melanoma short-term cultures and cell lines were propagated in vitro, and total RNA was extracted for microarray hybridization and sequencing.  The 9 Samples report the microarray hybridization results.
