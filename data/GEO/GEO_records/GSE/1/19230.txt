TITLE
The effect of sfh deletion on Salmonella Typhimurium gene expression

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium strains SL1344 (pSfR27) and SL1344 (pSfR27) delta sfh to identify 'Sfh-dependent' transcripts

DESIGN
Two condition experiment in which the transcriptomes of wild-type SL1344 (pSfR27) and SL1344 (pSfR27) delta sfh were compared to identify 'Sfh-dependent' transcripts
