TITLE
Ebp1's effect in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Therapies targeting the androgen receptor are critical for treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. We have previously demonstrated that Ebp1, a protein isolated by its ability to bind ErbB3, is a downstream effector of heregulin activated pathways and an AR corepressor. As Ebp1 is decreased in preclinical models of hormone refractory prostate cancer, we studied the ability of Ebp1 to mitigate the hormone refractory phenotype. As we previously found that Ebp1 affected the expression of some androgen receptor target genes, we sought to determine a full spectrum of genes changed using an unbiased appraoch by microarry analysis.
