TITLE
CBA/CaJ mouse cochlea gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data set is intended as a public resource documenting the identity of roughly 10,000 genes that are abundantly expressed in the mouse cochlea. The data have many uses, including for making comparisons with proteomics studies, and for comparisons of expression profiles with other mouse strains and with other species. The CBA/CaJ strain was chosen because of its lack of known vulnerabilities to premature cochlear degeneration or to extreme reactions to cochlear stresses. It may therefore be considered a “normal” mouse. No experimental manipulations were done on the mice of this study. Contamination of the results by genes expressed in the surrounding petrous bone and from those in  blood cells was minimized. Keywords: normal controls
