TITLE
Bio-electrospraying the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Bio-electrospray, the direct jet-based cell handling apporach, is able to handle a wide range of cells. Studies at the genomic, genetic, and the physiological level have shown that, post-treatment, cellular integrity is unperturbed and a high percentage ( > 70%, compared to control) of cells remain viable. Although, these results are impressive, it may be argued that cell based systems are oversimplistic. This study utilizing  a well characterised multicellular model organism, the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes were subjected to bio-electrosprays  to demonstrate that bio-electrosprays can be safely applied to nematodes.

DESIGN
The global  transcriptomic response was compared  in control nematodes (negative control),  heat shocked nematodes (positive control). and nematodes subjected to bio-electrospray.
