TITLE
Gene expression profiles following TP53 downregulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In three different ts-LT keratinocyte lines, TP53 was downregulated in four different ways. The vector constructs used for p53 abrogation were pWZL-p53DN-hygro (encoding the human p53 dominant-negative mutant Arg(175)His, pRS-p53shRNA-puro (containing a short hairpin RNA specific for p53), LZRS-E6-GFP (containing the HPV16-E6 oncogene) and the pRetrosuper miR-372. (containing the MicroRNA 372). Cells were transduced at 32°C as described above and checked for transduction efficiency by using an LZRS-GFP control. Only for miR-372 transduction efficiency showed to be below 90% and necessitated selection of positive cells by 1% blasticidin treatment for 5 days. Cells were harvested synchronously after two week culturing at 39°C.
