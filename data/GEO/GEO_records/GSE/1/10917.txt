TITLE
Preferential localization of human origins of DNA replication at the 5' end of expressed genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA replication relies on the activation of thousands of origins distributed along the genome. Their organization and the functional significance of their distribution remains unknown. To map large number of origins in human cells, we have localized the distribution of short nascent DNA using a high-resolution DNA tiling array platform covering 33.9Mb.  Results with three different cell lines reveal that origins are very closely spaced (average interval 3-5kb), and that their positions are largely conserved among the cell lines studied. Origins are non-randomly distributed, being preferentially enriched at the 5â€™-end of expressed genes and at evolutionary intergenic sequences. In MCF7 cells, a strong correlation is also found between origin positioning and histone H3K4me3 and of PolII binding to chromatin. This study provides a large scale view of the organization of DNA replication origins in human chromosomes and suggests a link between this distribution and underlying chromatin features related to chromosome structure, and gene expression Keywords: nascent strand DNA, histone, Pol-II ChIP-chip.
