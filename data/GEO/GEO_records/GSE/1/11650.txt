TITLE
Identification of targets of the protein disulfide reductase thioredoxin

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Identification of targets of the protein disulfide reductase thioredoxin using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and thiol specific differential labeling with isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT). Reduction of specific target disulfides is quantified by measuring ratios of cysteine residues labeled with the heavy (13C) and light (12C) ICAT reagents in peptides derived from tryptic digests of Trx-treated and non-treated samples. Keywords: protein, LC-MS/MS, ICAT
