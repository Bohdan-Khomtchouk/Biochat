TITLE
Altered expression of microRNAs in the myocardium of rats with acute myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important cellular components and their dysfunctions are associated with various disease. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. Although several miRNAs have been reported to be associated with AMI, more novel miRNAs are needed to be investigated to ascertain if they are associated with AMI.
