TITLE
Gene expression profiling of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs): identification of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) is characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, activation of fibroblast proliferation, and loss of normal pulmonary architecture and function. This analysis was performed to investigate the genetic backgrounds of IIP and identify potential biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis and serve as novel therapeutic target.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from lung specimens of 12 Japanese patients with chronic fibrosing IIP was profiled using Illumina Human WG-6 v3 BeadChips.
