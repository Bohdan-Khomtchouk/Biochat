TITLE
Effects of retinoids on estrogen-receptor-positive and -negative breast carcinoma cells:  mRNA profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overall study explores differential sensitivity of estrogen-receptor-positive and -negative breast carcinoma cells to retinoids via gene expression and microRNA profiling in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This Series reports results of transcriptional profiling of breast carcinoma cell lines comparing the effects of retinoic acid treatment (6 and 48 hours) on estrogen-receptor-positive (MCF7) and estrogen-receptor-negative (MDA-MB-231) cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling: Retinoic-acid-treated (1microM) vs vehicle-treated cells, two time points (6 and 48h), two cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). Two biological replicates for each condition, balanced dye design.
