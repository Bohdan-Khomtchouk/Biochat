TITLE
Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells: Control vs Tolerogenic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human dendritic cells (DC) comparing control (DC generated with GM-CSF plus IL-4) with three different treatments of tolerogenic (DC generated with GM-CSF plus IL-4 and IL-10, or IL-4, IL-10, and IL-6, or IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-b1)

DESIGN
Three two-condition experiments, control (N) vs tolerogenic DC with three different treatments. Pool of 4 indivuduals for each condition. One replicate per array.
