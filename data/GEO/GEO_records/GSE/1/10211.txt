TITLE
Airway Epithelial Cell Response to Sendai virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to establish a profile for gene expression in wild-type airway epithelial cells after paramyxoviral infection. Analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from SeV-infected primary-culture mouse tracheal epithelial cells that were maintained under physiologic conditions (air-liquid interface). Keywords: Treatment Comparison
