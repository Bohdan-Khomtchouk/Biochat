TITLE
Dkk4 and Eda regulate distinctive developmental mechanisms for subtypes of mouse hair-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dkk4 transgenic mice in wild-type background showed abnormal hair subtype formation. Gene expression profiling showed significant down regulation of hair follicle-related keratin genes and hair keratin-associated protein genes at E18.5 and P1. Keywords: development or differentiation design,genetic modification design

DESIGN
To define target genes of Dkk4 during hair follicle development, we  carried out microarray experiments with mouse back skin samples that from 4  developmental time points including E14.5, E16.5, E18.5 and P1 of wild-type and wild-type background Dkk4 transgenic mice.
