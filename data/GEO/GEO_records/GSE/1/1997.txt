TITLE
Hippocampal development in fetal alcohol exposed rats. Perrone-Bizzozero-5R01NS030255-12-3

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Study the effect of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) on hippocampal development Compare the pattern of gene expression in the hippocampus of FAE and control rats fed either an isocaloric diet or a normal diet, at post-natal day 5 of development. FAE will delay the maturation of the hippocampus Rats were fed one of three diet, a liquid diet with 5% ethanol (FAE group), an isocaloric liquid diet (Isocalorc group) or nomal lab chao (normal group) Keywords: dose response
