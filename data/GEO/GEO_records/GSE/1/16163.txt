TITLE
Meiotic time course of open chromatin as measured by FAIRE

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and meiotic processes, we used Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
