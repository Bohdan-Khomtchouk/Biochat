TITLE
Differential accumulation of small RNAs and microRNAs during ovule and fiber development in allotetraploid cotton

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To examine expression of miRNAs in cotton fiber development, we employed miRNA microarrays and compared miRNA accumulation level in cotton fibers, cotton leaves and mutant fibers.
