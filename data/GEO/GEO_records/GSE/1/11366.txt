TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of respiratory pathways in the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum

ORGANISM
Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2

SUMMARY
We compared global transcriptional patterns in Pyrobaculum aerophilum cultures with oxygen, nitrate, arsenate and ferric iron as respiratory electron acceptors to identify genes and regulatory patterns that differentiate these pathways. Keywords: Time course study with different respiratory electron acceptors
