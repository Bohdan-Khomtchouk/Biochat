TITLE
D. simulans vs. Sechellia bodies choice vs. no choice -Affymetrix

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we show that Drosophila sechellia—a specialist on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia that recently diverged from its generalist sister-species, D. simulans—has rapidly accumulated loss-of-function alleles and reduced gene expression at genes affecting olfaction, detoxification, and metabolism. While D. sechellia increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism when on its host, many more genes show reduced expression in D. sechellia.  For several functionally related genes, this decrease in expression is associated with loss-of-function alleles.  The rapid accumulation of these alleles potentially affected D. sechellia’s initial adaptation to M. citrifolia, likely contributes to D. sechellia’s poor competitive ability off of its host, and increases ecological isolation between D. sechellia and its sister species. Keywords: comparative hybridization, gene expression
