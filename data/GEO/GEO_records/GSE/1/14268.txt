TITLE
microRNA expression and opioid signaling

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To study the relationship between microRNAs and Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling, we examined microRNA expression after chronic morphine or fentanyl treatment in rat primary hippocampal neurons and in mouse hippocampus. Mouse cerebellum region was also tested as a negative control to eliminate microRNA expression changes unrelated to MOR signaling, as the cerebellum is essentially devoid of MOR.  We identified a number of microRNAs that altered their expression upon treatment with both morphine and fentanyl in the rat and mouse systems.  There were, however, some microRNAs that changed in response to morphine, or fentanyl, but not both. Keywords: Expression profiling
