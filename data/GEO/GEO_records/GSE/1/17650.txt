TITLE
Molecular characterization of Quebec Cohort of Primary Breast Cancer FFPE Tissues on the Human Cancer Panel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 97 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary breast tumors using Illumina DASL microarray technology on a Custom Breast Cancer Panel and the Illumina Human Cancer Panel. Molecular markers between the pathology defined subtypes of breast cancer were assessed to hypothesize potential therapeutic targets specific to the subtypes

DESIGN
Molecular Characterization of 97 primary breast tumor formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens including 24 triple negative (TN: ER-, PR-, HER2-), 9 HER2-positive (HER2+: ER-, PR-, HER2+), and 64 hormone receptor-positive (HR+: ER+ and/or PR+). 91 of the 97 specimens were characterized on the Illumina Human Cancer DASL Panel and 86 of 97 specimens were characterized on a custom Breast Cancer DASL Panel, 80 of these specimens were common to both the Human Cancer DASL Panel and the custom Breast Cancer DASL Panel.
