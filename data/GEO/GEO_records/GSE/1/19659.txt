TITLE
Indirect expression microarray from 5 pairs of tissues from colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5 colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and 5 paired non-tumor tissues from CRC patients were indirectly compared using a 17K cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
The total RNA from each tissue was labeled with Cy5, and the total RNAs from 11 human cell lines were labeled with Cy3 as the reference.
