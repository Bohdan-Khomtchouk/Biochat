TITLE
Down-regulation of ERBB3 by shRNA in the T47D cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERBB3 expression levels were down-regulated by shRNA. Two such stable lines were made and gene expression was measured by Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
Four types of T47D cell lines were compared: WT and shEGFP as controls, versus sh2608 and sh3293 as the ERBB3 down-regulated cells. Two replicates per cell line.
