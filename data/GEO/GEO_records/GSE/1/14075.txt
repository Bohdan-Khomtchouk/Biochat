TITLE
Response of Rhodopirellula baltica to salt shift

ORGANISM
Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the stress response of the marine Planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica after a salinity up-shift. R. baltica cultures were grown at 28Â°C in mineral media with 17.5% salinity and up-shifted to 59.9%. Samples were taken after 10, 20, 40, 60 and 300min and compared with cultures before the up-shift.
