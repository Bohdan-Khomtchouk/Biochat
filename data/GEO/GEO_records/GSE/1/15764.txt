TITLE
Comparison of whole brain expression data between selectively bred P and NP, alcohol na√Øve rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analyzed in brains of 4 male selectively-bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats (generation 63) and 3 male alcohol non-preferring (NP) rats (generation 62) that were obtained from Dr. Richard L. Bell, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.  These rats had never been exposed to alcohol.

DESIGN
Individual rats from each group were hybridized separately to individual arrays (one array per rat).  No duplicates are present.  Originally, four NP samples were analyzed, but one was dropped because of quality control standards.
