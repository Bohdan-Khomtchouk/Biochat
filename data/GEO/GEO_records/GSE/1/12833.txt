TITLE
Effect of VirR/VirS-VR-RNA regulatory cascade on the expression of chromosomal genes of Clostridium perfringens

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
The microarrays were subjected to two-color hybridization using Cy5 and Cy3 dyes incorporated in the cDNAs synthesized from total RNA samples of strains.  We compared each geneâ€™s transcription level between the wild-type (WT) strain 13 (labeled by Cy5) and the VirR-mutant strain (TS133) or VR-RNA-mutant strain (TS140) (both labeled by Cy3) on a single DNA microarray. Keywords: gene regulation in time course
