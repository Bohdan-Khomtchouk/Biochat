TITLE
Effect of wt versus mutant hsa-miR-122 overexpression on spontaneous hESC differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to determine whether overexpression of endoderm-specific miRNA may affect hESC differentiation. To this end, we analyzed the effect of lentiviral-based overexpression of liver-specific miR-122 on hESC differentiation, using genomewide gene microarrays. Stable overexpression of endoderm-specific miR-122 in hESC resulted in increased expression of a few endodermal markers in spontaneously-differentiating hESC, but had no clear effect on directing differentiation towards an endodermal fate; rather, it delayed the general differentiation of hESC.
