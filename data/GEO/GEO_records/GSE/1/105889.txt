TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the auxin/indoleacetic acid (Aux/IAA) gene family in allotetraploid rapeseed (Brassica napus L.)

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Background: Auxin/Indoleacetic acid (Aux/IAA) genes participate in the auxin signaling pathway and play key roles in plant growth and development. Although the Aux/IAA gene family has been identified in many plants, within allotetraploid Brassica napus little is known.   Results: In this study, a total of 119 Aux/IAA genes were found in the genome of B. napus. They were distributed non-randomly across all 19 chromosomes and other non-anchored random scaffolds, with a symmetric distribution in the A and C subgenomes. Evolutionary and comparative analysis revealed that 111 (94.1%) B. napus Aux/IAA genes were multiplied due to ancestral Brassica genome triplication and recent allotetraploidy from B. rapa and B. oleracea. Phylogenetic analysis indicated seven subgroups containing 29 orthologous gene sets and two Brassica-specific gene sets. Structures of genes and proteins varied across different genes but were conserved among homologous genes in B. napus. Furthermore, analysis of transcriptional profiles revealed that the expression patterns of Aux/IAA genes in B. napus were tissue dependent. Auxin-responsive elements tend to be distributed in the proximal region of promoters, and are significantly associated with early exogenous auxin up-regulation.   Conclusions: The Aux/IAA gene family were identified and analyzed comprehensively in the allotetraploid B. napus genome. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of diversification of Aux/IAA gene family and will facilitate further dissection of Aux/IAA gene function in B. napus.
