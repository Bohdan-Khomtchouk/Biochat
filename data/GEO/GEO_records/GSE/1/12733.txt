TITLE
Phenotypic profiling of adaptation to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction extends lifespan, an effect once thought to involve attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by aerobic metabolism. However, recent evidence suggests that caloric restriction may in fact raise ROS levels, which in turn provides protection from acute doses of oxidant through a process called adaptation. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, we designed a series of genome-wide deletion fitness screens to identify genes involved in adaptation to hydrogen peroxide.
