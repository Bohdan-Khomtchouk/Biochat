TITLE
Expression data from nonrandomized trial of vitamin D in Barrett's esophagus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased esophageal cancer risk.  Vitamin D controls many downstream regulators of cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.  We evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on global gene expression in patients with Barrett's esophagus. We used microarrays to assess global gene expression in Barrett's esophagus patients who received vitamin D supplementation.

DESIGN
Patients in Arm A with Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia were given vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 2 weeks.  Patients in Arm B with Barrett's esophagus with low grade dysplasia or no dysplasia were given vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 12 weeks.  In both arms, biopsies were obtained from two sites: Barrett's esophagus segment (IM) and normal squamous mucosa (NSQ) proximal to the segment at 2 timepoints: before (T0) and after (T1) vitamin D supplementation.
