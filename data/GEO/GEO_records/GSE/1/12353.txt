TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines exposed to six volatile organic compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of HL-60 cells were determined for two doses (IC20 and IC50) of three chemicals (ethylbenzene, tricholoretylene and dichloromethane) and for the IC50 doses of 3 other chemicals (benzene, toluene and o-xylene) at a 3 h time point. Assays were performed in triplicate for each chemical/dose, and individual gene-expression profiles were determined for each chemical at the tested concentration doses.
