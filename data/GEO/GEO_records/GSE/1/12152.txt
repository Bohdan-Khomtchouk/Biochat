TITLE
Genome scale transcriptome analysis of shoot organogenesis in poplar

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of transgenic plants for most species. Our aims are to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to meristem organization, and to identify regulatory genes that might be useful for improving the efficiency of regeneration during transformation. We analyzed gene expression during poplar regeneration using an Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® array representing over 56,000 poplar transcripts. Keywords: Time course
