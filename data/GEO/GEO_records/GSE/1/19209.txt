TITLE
Cold acclimation in pea

ORGANISM
Pisum sativum

SUMMARY
To understand physiological mechanisms of cold acclimation in pea, we performed a transcriptomique analysis in order to compare the response to LT treatment in two varieties, one being cold tolerant (Champagne) and the other cold sensitive (Terese).

DESIGN
For each genotype, course time d2, d5, d10 and d20 gene expression of each treatment (acclimated and non-acclimated) was compared with gene expression of d0 on slides.
