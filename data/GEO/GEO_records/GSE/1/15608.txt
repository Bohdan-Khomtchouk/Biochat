TITLE
Functional Genomics Reveals Extended Roles of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Stress Response Factor sigmaH

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
DNA Microarray based comparison of M. tuberculosis and its isogenic delta-sigmaH mutant for an extended period of time, using a diamide-stress and removal strategy (post-diamide stress or PDS) Raw data has been requested of, but not provided by, the submitter.

DESIGN
Two strains, M. tuberculosis vs delta-sigmaH mutant. At Pre-diamide (control), 0' 30' 60' 90' and 120' post-diamide stress, two biological replicates, six replicates per array
