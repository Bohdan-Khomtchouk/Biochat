TITLE
Gene expression in a Highly Tumorigenic Cells (HTC) purified from Urothelial Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarrays to compare RNA transcript expression from distinct cell populations sorted by FACS with an antibody against the 67Kd laminin receptor (67LR), and showing distinct tumorigenicity in vivo.

DESIGN
Sorted cells were derived by digesting xenografted sw 780 tumors into single cell suspensions. Differential gene expression was assessed by direct comparisons of labeled moieties, using a dye-swap design and biological replication. Hybridizations were performed on Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) Whole Human Genome DNA microarrays (hgug4112a). Three different samples were analyzed: 1) Urothelial cancer cells expressing 67LR (67LR+, BRIGHT); 2) Urothelial cancer cells not expressing 67LR (67LR-, DIM); 3) Control sorted urothelial cancer cells (BULK, containing both BRIGHT and DIM cells). In this series we provide normalized single channel intensities, aligned with the corresponding raw expression data.
