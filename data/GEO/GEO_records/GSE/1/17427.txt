TITLE
Csac growth on model substrates found in lignocellulose

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

SUMMARY
The co-utilization of hexoses and pentoses derived from lignocellulose is an attractive trait for in microorganisms considered for consolidated biomass processing to biofuels. This issue was examined for the H2-producing, extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus growing on oligosaccharides (composed of glucose and xylose) compared to monosaccharides. Based on the whole-genome transcriptional response analysis and comparative genomics, carbohydrate specificities for transport systems could be proposed for a number of the 24 putative carbohydrate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the C. saccharolyticus genome. Transcriptome analysis showed different transporters were utilized for uptake of oligosaccharides than those used for monosaccharides uptake. No evidence for catabolite repression was noted for either growth on multi-sugar mixtures or in the corresponding transcriptomes.
