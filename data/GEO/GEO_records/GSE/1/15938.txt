TITLE
S. pyogenes wild type vs. CvfA- mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
The overall gene expression of a CvfA- mutant of Streptococcus pyogenes grown in C medium was compared to that of the wild type (HSC5spc).  Stationary phase cells (8 hrs post-inoculation) were used because the gene expression of the CvfA- mutant was most different from that of the wild type at stationary phase, while the difference of gene expression between the CvfA- mutant and the wild type was negligible at exponential phase.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates (two different RNA sets extracted from the CvfA- mutant and the wild type at different day were used): 399773,399887,399888 vs. 399889,399890,399891 Technical replicates (Microarrays were hybridized with the same RNA with the same dye): 399773 and 399887; 399889 and 399890 Dye swap (Microarrays were hybridized with the same RNA but Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were swapped): 399773, 399887 vs. 399888; 399889, 399890 vs. 399891
