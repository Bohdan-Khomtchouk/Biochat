TITLE
Transcriptomic computational analysis of mastic oil-treated Lewis lung carcinomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mastic oil from Pistacia lentiscus variation chia, a blend of bioactive terpenes with recognized medicinal properties, has been recently shown to exert anti-tumor activity. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells are mastic oil-susceptible cells and were used in this work to study the effects of mastic oil at the transcriptomic level.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by array. LLC cells were treated with mastic oil or DMSO (control) for 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, or 48h. Two replicates per treatment/time point. Data were normalized using rank invariant and quantile normalization.
