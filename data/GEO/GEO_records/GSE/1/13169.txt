TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Daphnia magna, Part III: Uncovering Biomarkers for Metal and ORC exposures

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
To determine toxicant specific effects of Ordnance Related Compound (ORC) exposure we performed microarray hybridizations with RNA isolated from Daphnia magna following different ORC exposures at the 1/10 LC50.  The gene expression profiles revealed toxicant specific gene expression profiles allowed for the identification of specific biomarkers of exposure. Keywords: ecotoxicogenomic exposure study
