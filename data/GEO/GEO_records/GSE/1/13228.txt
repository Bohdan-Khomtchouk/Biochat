TITLE
Genomics-based molecular epidemiology of human clinical and feedlot cattle C. jejuni isolates in Alberta, Canada

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotide DNA microarrays were used as a platform to compare C. jejuni isolates from feedlot cattle and human clinical cases from Alberta. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed on 87 isolates (46 bovine, 41 human) obtained within the same geographical regions and time frame.  In addition, We also performed gene association analysis to determine if any genes may be differentially distributed between human and cattle sources or between clusters dominated by either human or cattle isolates (“human enriched” vs “cattle enriched”).
