SUMMARY
B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) consists of different pathological entities that are frequently characterized by distinct genetic alterations. However, the knowledge on these genetic lesions in B-NHL is still limited. In order to obtain a more comprehensive view of genetic lesions in B-NHL, we performed genome-wide analysis of copy number (CN) alterations as well as allelic imbalances using Affymetrix SNP arrays with B-NHL cases, including SNP array data were analyzed with CNAG/AsCNAR software, which enabled sensitive detection of CN alterations in allele-specific manner, and thus allelic imbalances, without depending on availability of paired normal controls. Most frequent numerical abnormalities in B-NHL were gains of chromosomes 3 and 18, although gains of chromosome 3 were less prominent in FL. Chromosomal deletions that lead to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were commonly found in 1p, 6q and 10q. High-grade amplifications and homozygous deletions frequently provide a clue to identify relevant gene targets. In our series, 12 loci of high-grade amplifications and 14 loci of homozygous deletions were identified, and helped to specify the candidate genes. These regions included, FCGR2B amplified in 5 cases of DLBCL, RERE amplified in 2 cases of FL and CDKN2A/CDKN2B deleted in 9 cases of DLBCL.
