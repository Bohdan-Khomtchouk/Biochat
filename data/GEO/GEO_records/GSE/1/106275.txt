TITLE
Alteration of the transcriptional program in dendritic cells by GOLPH2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the immune functions of GOLPH2 in dendritic cells in a comprehensive way, we performed global gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq on Illumina HiSeq 2000 in activated BMDCs from WT and GOLPH2 KO mice.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of BMDCs from WT and GOLPH2 KO mice with or without IFN-gamma and LPS stimulation
