TITLE
Chromosomal duplication in the grandifolia-D mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, tiling array data

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The number of cells in an organ is a major factor for the determination of organ size. However, genetic basis of cell number determination is not well understood. Three grandifolia-D (gra-D) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana developed huge leaves containing two- to three-fold increased number of cells of the wild type. Tiling array and microarray analysis of gra-D mutants suggested that genes found in a lower part of chromosome 4 were upregulated, suggesting the occurrence of segmental chromosomal duplications in the gra-D mutants. These region contain positive regulators of cell proliferation such as  AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and cyclin genes such as CYCD3;1.

DESIGN
genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from vegetative part of seedlings  grown in vitro. DNA from  wild type (wt, control) and the 3 grandifolia mutants (gra1-D, gra2-D and gra3-D) were submitted to tiling array hybridization.
