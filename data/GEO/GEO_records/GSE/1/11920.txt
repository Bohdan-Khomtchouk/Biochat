TITLE
Expression Profiles of Cloned Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) Lymphoid Cell Lines and a Mixed Lymphocyte Culture

ORGANISM
Ictalurus punctatus

SUMMARY
Clonal channel catfish lymphoid cell lines and mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) have proven extremely useful in examining immune responses at the cellular and molecular levels.  To date catfish cell cultures have been biologically and phenotypically characterized using a variety of techniques including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), as well as Northern and Southern Blotting.  To expand the molecular characterization of these cultures, microarray analysis was employed.  Clonal B (3B11), macrophage (42TA), and cytotoxic T cell (TS32.15 and TS32.17) lines and MLC were examined using a cDNA array containing ~ 2500 probes derived from EST libraries prepared from the 42TA macrophage cell line, a MLC, and 5 - 14 day old catfish fry.  Analysis showed that each cell line displayed a unique RNA expression profile that included a variety of immune-related genes.  Pearson correlation analysis indicated that one cytotoxic T cell line clustered with MLC, whereas a second cytotoxic T cell line was more closely associated with B cells and macrophages
