TITLE
STS107 T-cell activation at 1g vs. vg

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood leukocytes of three human donors (Donors 2, 4, and 5) were isolated from blood bank buffy-coat preparations by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, and T-cells were purified with high affinity negative selection human CD3+ T-cell enrichment columns.  The cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS with approximately 3-8 millions cells/mL at room temperature overnight.  T-cells were then either unactivated (1g 0 hr), activated (1g 4 hr) with a final concentration of 5 mg/mL Con A + 4 mg/mL anti-CD28 antibody and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, or loaded onto a RPM rotating at 60°/s (vg).  T-cells loaded on the RPM were cultured for 2 hours prior to collection or activation to allow equilibration of cells to the new environment.  After incubation, 1 mL of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate in 750 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 7, with N-lauroylsarcosine and beta-mercaptoethanol was added to lyse cells and stabilize RNA.
