TITLE
Gene expression analysis of a podocyte specific PTIP deletion in mouse glomerular preparations at 1 month of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glomerular RNA comparison between wild-type and podocyte specific deletion of the PTIP gene in 1 month old kidneys. The PTIP gene was deleted using a floxed allele and a Podocin-Cre driver strain. These mice develop protein urea by 3 months of age. This study was designed to find gene expression differences prior to the onset of the phenotype.

DESIGN
A ptip floxed allele was crossed into the Podocin-Cre expressing strain to generate ptip fl/fl homozygous mice or ptip fl/- transheterozygous mice with or without the Cre expressing transgene. Animals were genotyped and assigend into two groups: Mutants with PTIP deletion (PTIP-) with the genotype ptip fl/fl:Pod-Cre or ptip fl/-:Pod-Cre or control mice (PTIP+) with either ptip fl/fl or ptip fl/-. Note that the floxed allele produced normal levels of wild-type PTIP protein. Kidneys were excised at 1 month of age. Glomeruli enriched fractions were generated by sieving of the tissue homogenates. RNA was prepared from glomerular enriched fractions.
