TITLE
Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from mesenchymal cells of gut mesentery by Oct4/Sox2/Nanog

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background and aim: Human Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been derived from dermal ﬁbroblasts, keratinocytes and blood cells by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors.1–5 Application of this approach in human cells would have enormous potential and generate patient-specific pluripotent stem cells to accelerate the implementation of stem cells for clinical treatment of degenerative diseases. In the present study, we investigated whether genetically marked human mesenchymal cells of gut mesentery may give rise to iPS cells. Methods: We used lentiviruses to express Oct4, Sox2, Nanog in mesenchymal cells of gut mesentery, then generated iPS cells were identified in many aspects including morphology, pluripotent markers, global gene expression profile, DNA methylation status at pluripotent cell-speciﬁc genes, embryoid bodies and terotomas formation. Results: The resulting iPS cells from mesenchymal cells of gut mesentery were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, and epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-speciﬁc genes. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. DNA ﬁngerprinting showed that the human iPS cells were derived from the donor cells and are not a result of contamination.
