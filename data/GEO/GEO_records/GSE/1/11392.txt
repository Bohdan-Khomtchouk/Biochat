Pathway analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) confined to the CNS. A genome-wide gene expression comparison between PCNSL and non-CNS DLBCL was performed, the latter consisting of both nodal and extranodal DLBCL (nDLBCL and enDLBCL), to identify a “CNS signature.” Keywords: disease state analysis
