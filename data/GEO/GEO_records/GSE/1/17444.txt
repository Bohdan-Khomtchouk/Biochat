TITLE
Drosophila elevated CO2 (hypercapnia) microarray

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effects of elevated CO2 (hypercapnia) on organisms are not well known, nor are the molecular pathways by which organisms sense CO2. We have performed microarray analysis on Drosophila in order to develop a genetic model for better understanding the effects of CO2.
