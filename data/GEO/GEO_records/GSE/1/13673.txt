TITLE
Transcriptional Regulation of HL60 Neutrophil Differentiation: Promyelocyte trajectory vs. Neutrophil trajectory

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the HL60 multipotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we performed experiments that lead to two different cell fate attractors by treatments of varying dosage and duration of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The dosage and duration combinations corresponding to the two treatments were chosen by means of of cytometric measurements of CD11b, a well-known early differentiation marker, such that the two populations are poised at the same stage of differentiation. Using the selected treatment combinations, one population proceeds toward the terminally differentiated neutrophil attractor while the other population reverts back toward the undifferentiated promyelocytic attractor. We monitored the gene expression changes in the two populations after their respective treatments over a period of five days and identified a set of genes that diverged in their expression; a subset of which promotes neutrophil differentiation while the other represses cell cycle progression. By employing promoter based transcription factor binding site analysis, we found enrichment of transcription factors functionally linked to tumor progression, cell cycle, and development. Keywords: Time course, dose response
