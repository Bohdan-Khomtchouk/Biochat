TITLE
Gene expression profiles of oxaliplatin resistant colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxaliplatin resistance was induced in 2 colorectal cancer cell lines (LoVo-92, wt-p53 and LoVo-Li, functionally inactive p53) and one ovarian cancer cell line (A2780, wt-p53). Resistance was induced by weekly exposure to oxaliplatin for 4 hrs or 72 hrs with increasing concentrations for a period of 7 months.

DESIGN
After RNA isolation, 500ng of RNA of the resistant and parental cell line were linearly amplified and fluorescently labeled with either Cy3-CTP or Cy5-CTP with the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). Equal amounts (1µg) of Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP labeled samples were hybridized to Agilent 4x44K Whole Human Genome arrays (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer. Equal amounts (1µg) of Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP labeled samples were hybridized to Agilent 44K Whole Human Genome arrays (Agilent Technologies, Part Number G4112A) according to manufacturer's instructions. Microarrays were scanned using an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner, and scans were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 8.5.1). Raw expression data generated by the Feature Extraction software was imported into R using the LIMMA package in Bioconductor ( ). As overall background levels were very low, no background correction was performed. The intensity distributions within and between arrays were normalized using the quantile scaling algorithm in LIMMA. After normalization, the separate intensity channels were extracted from the ratio measurements and combined to the intensities of the reference. The parental cell line was used as reference.
