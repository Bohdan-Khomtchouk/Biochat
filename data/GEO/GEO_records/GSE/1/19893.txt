TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 35S:AtMYB102-SRDXplant under salt stress treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis transgenic 35S:AtMYB102-SRDX plant under MS medium containing 200mM NaCl for 24h. Transgenic Arabidopsis (background : Col-0) overexpressing AtMYB102 fused to an active transcriptional repression domain (SRDX) showed strong salt tolerance.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control condition (3-week old plant was transfered to MS medium for 24h) and Salt stress condition (plant was transferred to MS containg 200mM NaCl for 24h), Biological replicates: 3 control replicates and 3 salt stress condition replicates.
