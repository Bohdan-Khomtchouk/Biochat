Expression data from hyperplastic polyps and normal colonic mucosa from patients with familial and sporadic HPPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from hyperplastic polyps and normal colonic mucosa from patients with familial and sporadic hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (HPPS). We aim to characterize at a molecular level a cohort of hyperplastic lesions from HPPS patients with and without family history.

DESIGN
RNA from hyperplastic polyps and normal colonic mucosa (proximal and distal) from patients with familial and sporadic HPPS were included in this study. Total RNA was isolated from each tissue sample, quantified and its quality evaluated. cRNA preparation, hybridization and analysis of results was performed according to Affymetrix recommendations. cRNA was hybridised in the  GeneChip array (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0, Affymetrix), and the intensity was measured.
