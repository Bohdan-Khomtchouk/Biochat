TITLE
Aggressive Potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN) and mild PVYN isolates trigger different specific responses in susceptible potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato virus YNTN (PVYNTN) is one of the most devastating potato virus causing great losses in the potato production industry. PVYNTN induces severe symptoms on inoculated leaves and a disease known as potato tuber necrosis ringspot disease (PTNRD) develops on tubers. Closely related PVYN isolate induces only mild symptoms on inoculated potato leaves and no symptoms on tubers. The early response of sensitive potato cvs. Igor and Nadine to inoculation with PVYNTN and PVYN was analysed allowing identification of genes involved in severe symptoms induction. Microarray and quantitative-PCR analysis was carried out to identify differentially expressed genes after inoculation with both virus isolates. Two distinct groups of genes were shown to have a role in severe symptoms development â€“ one group of genes related to energy production and a second group of genes connected with virus spread. Earlier accumulation of sugars and decrease in photosynthesis was observed in leaves inoculated with aggressive PVYNTN isolate than in leaves inoculated with milder PVYN isolate. PVYNTN isolate was shown not to activate differential expression of antioxidant metabolism and pectinmethylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) leading to a delay in plant response and on the other hand it limited callose deposition enabling faster virus spread through the plant.

DESIGN
Each microarray was hybridized with PVYNTN inoculated sample and PVYN inoculated sample from the same biological replicate. Three biological replicates were analyzed.
