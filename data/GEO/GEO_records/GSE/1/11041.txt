TITLE
Overlapping and unique responses of E. coli to adverse conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In the present study we have determined the global gene expression and biomolecular composition in an Escherichia coli model strain exposed to ten adverse conditions (sodium chloride, ethanol, glycerol, two acids (hydrochloric acid and acetic acid), sodium hydroxide, heat (46°C) and cold (15°C) as well as ethidium bromide and the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride). The large variation in responses and few common genes illustrates the adaptation potential of E. coli and its ability to survive and colonize a wide range of environments. Keywords: gene expression study, stress response
