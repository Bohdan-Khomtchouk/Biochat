TITLE
Identification of Myc target genes in xenograft tissue derived from human lung cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All three transforming members of the Myc family play a significant role in the development of both SCLC and NSCLC. NSCLC constitutes 80% of all lung cancer, and cMyc expression is most often deregulated, compared with N-Myc and L-Myc, in this disease. Thus, although we are interested in understanding the regulation and function of the entire Myc family in all lung cancers, we focused our research on cMyc deregulation in NSCLC. To identify target genes whose regulatory regions are bound in response to deregulated cMyc in NSCLC, we analyzed mouse xenograft tumours established in immune-compromised mice from monolayer cell lines derived from primary adenocarcinoma NSCLCs. These xenografts were chosen for further study because they show a genetic profile similar to their respective primary tumour (MGH8, RVH6849, A549, MGH24). High c-myc expression positively correlates with the ability of NSCLC cell lines to form xenografts, suggesting that Myc contributes towards the ability of the cells to grow in vivo. We conducted Myc-specific ChIP-chip and the corresponding normal IgG control using the Agilent genome-wide oligonucleotide promoter arrays on 3 biological replicates, of each of the four xenograft tumours. Following pre-processing using variance-stabilizing normalization and statistical analysis using general linear models we identified a list of 2,207 genes significantly enriched for c-Myc binding.
