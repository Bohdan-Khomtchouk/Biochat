TITLE
treatment g-butyrobetaine wt col.0-Effect of carnitine on the transcriptome of A. thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-01_carnitine - treatment g-butyrobetaine wt col.0 - Effect of carnitine on the transcriptome of A. thaliana - Seedlings WT are growing in a independent way on media MS. After seven days of culture, seedling are harvested and a pull is formed from the three prelevements. Extractions of RNA will be realised on this pull. We proceed in a identical way for the test sample. Seedlings are cultivated on media MS containing butyrobétaïne 1 mM. After seven days, seedlings are harvested and extractions of RNA will be realised on this second pull. All this experiment is repeated one more time independently. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
