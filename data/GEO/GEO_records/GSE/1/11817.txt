TITLE
The MSL3 chromodomain directs a key targeting step for dosage compensation of the Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Active genes on the X chromosome of Drosophila males are upregulated by the Male-specific lethal (MSL) complex containing five MSL proteins and two non-coding roX RNAs. To probe the targeting mechanism, we have solved the structure of the MSL3 chromodomain, designed point mutations in key residues that disrupt putative methyl-lysine recognition, and tested their effect on full length MSL3 function. Transgenic males expressing these site-directed point mutants or MSL3short, a naturally occurring MSL3 form lacking the chromodomain, are unhealthy and developmentally delayed. Genomewide analyses of the binding patterns of these mutants support a two-step model: the first step is chromodomain-independent association with “chromatin entry sites” carrying GA-rich MSL recognition elements (MREs). The second step involves spreading from entry sites to the majority of active genes on the X. Either deleting or introducing point mutations in the MSL3 chromodomain disrupts this second step. In vitro studies demonstrate that chromodomain mutants have diminished interaction with recombinant nucleosomes methylated at H3K36. We propose that MSL spreading depends, to a large extent, on the integrity of the MSL3 chromodomain to interact with lysine-methylated nucleosomes.
