TITLE
The effects of dietary curcumin on colonic gene expression in TNBS-induced colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound capable of preventing chemically induced colitis in mice. We used microarray analysis to detail the global programme of colonic gene expression in BALB/c mice fed standard or 2% curcumin-supplemented diet and treated with control or TNBS (trnitrobenzene-sulfonic acid, 2 mg/mouse) enema. Keywords: Diet and disease effect.
