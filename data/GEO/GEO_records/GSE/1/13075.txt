TITLE
SIRT1 and H1AcK26 promoter-association in mouse ES cells changes upon oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Association of the (histone) deacetylase SIRT1 with promoters was assessed to determine putative SIRT1-regulated genes. Based on the observation that the SIRT1 yeast ortholog Sir2 redistributes across the yeast genome in repsonse to genotoxic stress and double strand breaks (DSBs), we investigated the impact of oxidative stress on the chromatin binding pattern of SIRT1. Oxidative stress causes a major change in SIRT1 binding that is accompanied by an inverse H1K26 acetylation pattern. H1K26 was shown to be a direct target for deacetylation by SIRT1. Keywords: ChIP-chip, stress response
