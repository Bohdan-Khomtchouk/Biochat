TITLE
Regions of acquired UPD at diagnosis of FL are associated with both overall survival and risk of transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP array analysis was performed using the Affymetrix 10K 2.0 Gene-chip array on DNA from 181 diagnostic Follicular Lymphoma (FL) patients to assess the prognostic relevance of aUPD. Genetic abnormalities were detected in 118/181 (65%) patients. Number of abnormalities was predictive of outcome; > 3 abnormalities was associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (p < 0.03). Sites of recurrent aUPD were detected on 6p (n=25), 16p (n=22), 12q (n=17), 1p36 (n=14), 10q (n=8) and 6q (n=8). On multivariate analysis aUPD 1p36 correlated with shorter OS (p=0.05). aUPD 16p was predictive of transformation (p=0.03) and correlated with poorer progression free survival (p=0.02). Keywords: Genomic analysis of FL samples
