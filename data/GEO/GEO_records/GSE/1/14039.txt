SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x deltoides) leaves to methyl jasmonate treatment over a 24 hour time course.  Experiments were conducted using clonal trees under greenhouse conditions at the University of British Columbia.  We used the 15.5K poplar cDNA microarray platform previously described by Ralph et al. (Molecular Ecology 2006, 15:1275-1297).  Differentially expressed genes were determined using three criteria: fold-change between methyl jasmonate-treated and tween-treated control leaves > 1.5-fold, P value < 0.05 and Q value < 0.05.  This study identified > 1,000 differentially expressed genes in response to methyl jasmonate treatment.
