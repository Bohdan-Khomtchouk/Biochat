TITLE
Gene expression profile of H187-63AR, an ABT-737 resistant derivative of H187

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ABT-737 is a highly potent small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 which has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies.  To identify factors which mediate ABT-737 sensitivity we created an ABT-737-resistant cell line derivative. This cell lines maintained its ABT-737 resistance in vitro and in vivo.  We isolated RNA from H187-63AR xenografts and compared their global gene expression to H187 xenografts. Keywords: Tumor comparison
