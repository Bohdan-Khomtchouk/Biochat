TITLE
Gene expression profiles from osteosarcpma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma patients with development of pulmonary metastasis have still poorer prognosis in spite of aggressive treatment. However, molecular mechanism of metastasis is still unknown. We analysed the expression levels of 54,613 probe sets in  surgical 27 samples of osteosarcoma with GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 27 fresh frozen tumour specimens. We analysed the global gene exprssion profiles of these osteosarcoma cases in order to clarify the genomic basis behind the development of pulmonary metastasis.
