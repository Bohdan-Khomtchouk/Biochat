TITLE
Effect of pH on Cadmium Toxicity in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Metals at high concentrations can exert toxic effects on microorganisms.  It has been widely reported that lowering environmental pH reduces effects of cadmium toxicity in bacteria.  Understanding the effects of pH-mediated cadmium toxicity on bacteria would be useful for minimizing cadmium toxicity in the environment and gaining insight into the interactions between organic and inorganic components of life.  Growth curve analysis confirmed that cadmium was less toxic to Escherichia coli at pH 5 than at pH 7 in M9 minimal salts medium.  To better understand the cellular mechanisms by which lowering pH decreases cadmium toxicity, we used DNA microarrays to characterize global gene expression patterns in E. coli in response to cadmium exposure at moderately acidic (5) and neutral (7) values of pH.  Higher expression of several stress response genes including hdeA, otsA, and yjbJ at pH 5 after only 5 minutes was observed and may suggest that acidic pH more rapidly induces genes that confer cadmium resistance.  Genes involved in transport were more highly expressed at pH 7 than at pH 5 in the presence of cadmium.  Of the genes that showed an interaction between pH and cadmium effects, 46% encoded hypothetical proteins, which may have novel functions involved in mitigating cadmium toxicity.
