TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells treated with extracts of R.coptidis from different growing regions vs. DMSO-treated control group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rhizoma coptidis (R.coptidis) is a widely cultivated traditional Chinese herb. Although the chemical profiles of R.coptidis have been established previously, the biological profiling of R.coptidis has not been conducted yet. Here, we collected R.coptidis varieties from four different regions as well as its analogue, Rabdosia serra (R.serra) were  and performed genome-wide biological response fingerprinting (BioReF) on HepG2 cells using a gene expression array.

DESIGN
Analysis used DMSO-treated RNA as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples treated with R.coptidis from Dayi, Lichuan, Shizhu, Yaan and R.serra from Yunnan. Indirect comparisons were made across multiple arrays with raw data pulled from different channels for data analysis and comparison to the control data.
