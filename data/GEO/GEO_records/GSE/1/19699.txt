TITLE
Gene Expression in Human Lung Type II Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal lung function relies on mature function of alveolar type II cels, which have numerous functions including to regulate ion and fluid flux, produce immune molecules, and synthesize and secrete surfactant to stabilize air spaces.  Differentiation of type II cells from precursor epithelial cells is accelerated by exposure of cultured cells to glucocorticoid and cAMP. In these studies we used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes of both fetal and adult type II cells that are regulated by glucocorticoid plus cAMP.

DESIGN
In the first series of experiments we isolated epithelial cells from fetal human lung and cultured cells for 5 days with or without hormone treatment (dexamethasone plus 8-Br-cAMP plus isobutylmethylxanthine, DCI) and then performed DNA microarray analysis. In the second series of experiments, we isolated type II cells from adult human postmortem lung and cultured cells for 5 days with or without DCI and performed DNA microarray analysis.
