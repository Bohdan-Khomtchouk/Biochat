TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana young flowers: Wild type vs. sdg2-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in young flowers (stage 8) of Arabidopsis wild type control plants and sdg2-1 mutant is performed using Aligentâ€™s Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K). A significant number of genes involved in gametophyte development are found differentially regulated in the sdg2-1 mutant.
