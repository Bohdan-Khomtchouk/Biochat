TITLE
A mesodermal gene regulatory network directed by zebrafish No tail

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarrays we have identified targets of No tail (Ntl), a zebrafish Brachyury ortholog that plays a central role in mesoderm formation. We show that Ntl regulates a downstream network of other transcription factors and identify an in vivo Ntl binding site that resembles the consensus T-box binding site (TBS) previously identified by in vitro studies. We show floating head (flh) is a direct transcriptional target of Ntl in the notochord and that TBS in the flh  upstream region are required for Ntl directed expression. Using this genome-scale data we have assembled a Gene Regulatory Network that describes mesoderm formation and patterning in the early zebrafish embryo and which predicts a role for Ntl in somite segmentation.
