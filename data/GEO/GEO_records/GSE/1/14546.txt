TITLE
Effect of PPARγ inhibition on pulmonary endothelial cell gene expression: Gene profiling in pulmonary hypertension

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The loss of PPARγ is found to be associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). We hypothesize that  PPARγ inhibition induced gene expression changes may underscore the endothelial dysfunction in the disease process. We utilized microarray analysis to determine gene expression changes in PPARγ inhibited ovine PAECs.
