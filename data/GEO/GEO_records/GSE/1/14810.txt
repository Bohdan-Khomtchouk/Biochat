TITLE
Microarray data from murine C3H/10T1/2 and 3T3 L1 adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Growing evidence indicates that PPARÎ³ agonists, such as rosiglitazone (RSG,), induce adipose mitochondrial biogenesis. Using microarrays, we systematically analyzed nucleus-encoded mitochondrial gene expression in two common murine adipocyte models, 3T3 L1 and C3H/10T1/2 adipocytes, and aimed to further establish the direct role of RSG, and capture the temporal changes in mitochondrial gene transcription during this process. Keywords: Time course in two cell types

DESIGN
Fully differentiated 3T3 L1 and C3H/10T1/2 adipocytes were treated with RSG, or DMSO vehicle for 1, 2, 4, 7, 24, and 48 hrs, and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.
