TITLE
Gene expression profile in breast cancer cell lines using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify novel molecular targets associated with TNBC progression, we initially performed transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing in breast cancer cell lines, classified as either the luminal subtype (MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75B) or basal-like subtype (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, Hs578T).

DESIGN
Total RNAs of each cell were isolated using the TRIzol reagent for RNA sequencing following manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The total RNAs were treated with DNase I, purified with miRNeasy Mini Kit and subsequently quality checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. An Illumina platform was used to analyze transcriptomes with 90 bp paired-end library. Samples were paired-end sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 using HiSeq Sequencing kits.
