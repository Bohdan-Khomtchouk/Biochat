TITLE
plp2 botrytis cinerea 2-Functional analysis of lipid acyl hydrolases in Arabidopsis antimicrobial defense

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Effects of deregulation of a lipid acyl hydrolase gene (PLP2, At2g26560) on global transcriptome upon infection by Botrytis cinerea. This deregulation affects resistance levels against fungal and bacterial pathogens, likely by perturbing the biosynthesis of oxylipins. Oxylipins are fatty acid-derived compounds (example:jasmonic acid) with diverse signaling or antimicrobial properties. - 5000 spores of Botrytis were pipetted on 4 infection sites per ault leaf. Leaf material was harvested at 0,1,2,3 days later. 3 plant genotypes were used (Col-0 ecotype): siPLP2 (RNAi-silenced),pBIN (empty pBIN-transformed),PLP2OE (PLP2-overexpressors). Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),normal vs rnai mutant comparaison,time course

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
