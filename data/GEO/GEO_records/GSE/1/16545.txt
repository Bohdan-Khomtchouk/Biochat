TITLE
Arabidopsis Argonaute4, Argonaute6 and Argonaute9 associated small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced the small RNA bound to AGO4, AGO6 and AGO9 and compared these sRNAs to other libraries isolated such as total sRNAs, ago4 mutant, drd3-1 mutant, an AGO4 D660A slicer mutant and AGO6 and AGO9 under the AGO4 promoter. Keywords: Epigenetics

DESIGN
Illumina samples: There are 17 unique samples representing 2 biological replicates of AGO6IP, 2 biological replicates of AGO9 IP, 3 biological replicates of total floral small RNAs, 1 technical replicate of total floral small RNA. 454 samples: These samples comprise 3 biological replicates of FLAG AGO4 IP.
