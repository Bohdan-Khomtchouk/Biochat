TITLE
Sodium arsenate response of wild type and slt2 deficient cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Wild type (BY4741) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and their isogenic slt2 deficient counterparts, were treated for 2 hours with sodium arsenate 100 micromolar. Control (untreated) cells were also collected. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by microarray hybridization. The data obtained from these experiments allows to determine those genes that are regulated by Slt2 activity after arsenate treatment.
