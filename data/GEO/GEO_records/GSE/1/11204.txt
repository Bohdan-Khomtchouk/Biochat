TITLE
Altered gene expression and DNA damage in peripheral blood cells from Friedreich's ataxia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, is reduced in patients with Friedreichâ€™s ataxia (FRDA).  Transcription profiling and DNA damage assays were performed on blood cells from FRDA patients.  Altered expression patterns pertained to immune response, signaling pathways, transcription, apoptosis, and genotoxic stress response pathways.  FRDA patients had significantly more mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage than a control population.  Frataxin mRNA levels correlated with age of onset and displayed unique sets of gene alterations involved in oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis.  Thus analysis of blood in FRDA patients yields insight into the nature and progression of the disease, as well as potential therapeutic approaches. Keywords: Friedreich's ataxia; frataxin; mitochondrial DNA damage; nuclear DNA damage; genotoxic stress
