TITLE
Induction of the IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway in the lungs of mice exposed to tobacco

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have examined the impact of subchronic levels of tobacoo smoke on murine lungs. We have used high density DNA microarray and analysed lung tissues from mice exposed to mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS). Our results reveal induction of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its antagonist suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS3) mRNA in smoking group. We also show that these changes are transient and are reversed completely after a period of cessation of smoking. Keywords: Toxicology, disease state analysis, biomarkers of health effects
