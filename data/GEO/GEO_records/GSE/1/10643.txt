TITLE
Transcription profiling of Arabidopsis dor mutant and wild-type plants in response to drought stress.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ATH1 GeneChip was used for gene expression analysis of wild-type plants and dor mutant under drought treatment (both the wild-type and dor plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed by completely depriving of irrigation for 10 days). Two biological repeat experiments were conducted and the raw data was analyzed applying Affymetrix GCOS software. Keywords: both the wild-type and dor plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed  for 10 days
