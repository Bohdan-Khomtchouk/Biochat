TITLE
Role of AhR in thymocyte emigration in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over-activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by TCDD in mice leads among other phenotypes to a severe thymic atrophy accompanied by immunosuppression. TCDD causes a block in thymocyte maturation and a preferential emigration of immature CD4-CD8- DN thymocytes (recent thymic emigrants) into the periphery. As part of this study gene expression profiles from DN thymocytes and thymic emigrants were generated from TCDD and solvent control mice Keywords: Affymetrix, TCDD, CD4-CD8- thymocytes, Thymus involution, thymic emigration, Ahr
