Gene expression pattern similarity and differences between hair follicles and basal cell carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hair follicles (HF) and BCCs can be regarded as ordered and disordered skin appendages respectively and may utilize similar molecular mechanisms of growth. We wanted to examine the similarities and differences in gene expression patterns between BCCs and HF to define common growth mechanisms and gene expression patterns that distinguish an ordered skin appendage from a disordered skin growth. Nodular BCCs (n= 8) and non-follicular skin epithelium (n=8) were obtained. Scalp hair follicle root sheath was micro dissected from between the sebaceous gland duct and the lower one third of the HF (n=7). Microarray analysis was performed using 21K cDNA arrays and selected genes were validated using qPCR and histochemistry staining. Two differentially expressed gene sets were identified by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) in BCC and HF verses skin epithelium respectively. Based on these two lists, we conducted multiple signaling pathway analyses. The results indicated that Notch, hedgehog, and WNT signaling pathways were involved in regulating formation of both HF and BCCs. However, Notch signaling, including tumor suppressor genes Notch 1, Notch 2, Jagged ligands (JAG 1, 2), notch signaling inhibitor NUMB, Lunatic Fringe (LFNG), Deltex proteins (DTX 1, 2) which serve as important signaling components downstream of Notch, and Notch target genes HES1 ,RBPSUHL, hairless protein and HES7, all showed selective differential activation in BCCs compared to HF. The components of the notch signaling pathway may be potential new targets in the development of new therapeutic approaches to BCCs.
