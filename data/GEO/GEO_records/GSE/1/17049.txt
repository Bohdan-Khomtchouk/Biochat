TITLE
Parasite strain-specific pathogenesis in murine infections with Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different strains of T. brucei induce different degrees of pathology in infected animals, and TREU927-infected mice display greater splenomegaly and anaemia than 247-infected mice. The analysis of differential host gene expression in infected spleens has allowed the identification of which pathways or processes are crucial in determining the progression of disease, for example IL10, LXR/RXR activation and alternative macrophage activation. We used microarray analysis to examine host gene expression between uninfected and infected mice, and between mice infected with the two trypanosome strains.

DESIGN
Mouse spleens were dissected from infected or uninfected mice 10 days post infection, when the differences in pathology criteria (hepatomegaly, red blood cell numbers, reticulocyte percentage, IL10, IFNg and Il12 levels, and splenomegaly) were the greatest. This allowed a three-way comparison, uninfected vs 247-infected, uninfected vs 927-infected, and 247-infected vs 927-infected, allowing us to analyse genes that are differentially expressed between infected and uninfected spleens, but also crucially allows the differentiation between host gene expression with pathogenic (927) and less pathogenic (247) trypanosome strains.
