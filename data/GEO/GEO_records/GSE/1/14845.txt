TITLE
A Whole Genome Approach to Characterising a Novel Immunodeficiency Disorder

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays were used to characterise a novel immunodeficiency disorder, Herbert's Syndrome.

DESIGN
Affymetrix 250K Sty arrays run through genomic DNA from peripheral blood of case and control subjects, used for DNA copy number analysis. Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays run through total-RNA from peripheral blood of case and control subjects, used for differential gene expression analysis.
