SUMMARY
Colon gene expression in human IBD. The three major clinical subsets of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) include colon-only Crohn's Disease (CD), ileo-colonic CD, and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  These experiments tested differential colon gene expression in these three types of IBD, relative to healthy control samples, and the local degree of mucosal inflammation as measured by the CD Histological Index of Severity (CDHIS). Colon biopsy samples were obtained from IBD patients at diagnosis and during therapy, and healthy controls. The global pattern of gene expression was determined using GeneSpring software, with a focus upon candidate genes identified in a recent genome wide association study in pediatric onset IBD. Data suggested that two of these candidate genes are up regulated in pediatric IBD, partially influenced by local mucosal inflammation. These experiments tested differential colon gene expression in healthy, CD, and UC samples for candidate genes identified in a recent pediatric onset IBD genome wide association study. Keywords: Single time point in CD and UC and healthy controls.
