TITLE
R1 mESC Exposed to Butyrate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of sodium butyrate exposure on mouse ESC grown without self-renewal support (I.e. without feeders or LIF) - these cells were compared to cells grown without sodium buytrate, but with added mouse LIF via Agilent whole mouse genome array

DESIGN
R1 mESC were grown under 2 conditions, with mLIF on gelatin or without LIF on gelatin for 15 passages to compare change in the RNA profile
