TITLE
Gene expression patterns under conditions of oxidative stress in Geobacter uraniumreducens

ORGANISM
Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4

SUMMARY
Previous analysis of gene transcript levels of Geobacter species in groundwater during in situ bioremediation of a uranium-contaminated aquifer detected expression of genes encoding superoxide dismutase (sodA) and cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase (cydA), proteins known to be involved in the response to oxidative stress in other microorganisms.  In order to further elucidate gene expression patterns that could be attributed to oxygen exposure, G. uraniumreducens was grown with acetate as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor in the presence of oxygen and compared to non-oxygen treated cultures.
