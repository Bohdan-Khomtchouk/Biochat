TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of Mice liver treated with Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study describes the differential gene expression analysis in murine liver following dosing with human therapeutic equivalent doses of Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine antimalarial drugs.The dosing was decided based on standard antimalarial therapy.

DESIGN
Mice (Mus musculus) belonging to control and Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine -Pyrimethamine administered groups (n=4) were sacrificed. The livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80ºC till further use. Liver samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted with TRI reagent. 25 ug of total RNA was converted into labeled cDNA using CyScribe first strand cDNA labeling kit. The Cy5 and Cy3 labeled cDNAs were resuspended in Cyscribe Hyb buffer containing 10ug/ml sheared Salmon sperm DNA and 10ug/ml Yeast tRNA. The labeled samples were hybridized to the arrays and incubated for 16-18hrs at 42ºC. Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with molecular dynamics III scanner supported with ImageQuant v5.0. Image intensity data were extracted and analyzed with ArrayVision v8.0 analysis software. Background corrected data was LOWESS normalized and log ratios were calculated using Avadis v4. Further, mean log ratios were calculated for duplicate spots. Duplicate experiment were carried out for all the dosages.
