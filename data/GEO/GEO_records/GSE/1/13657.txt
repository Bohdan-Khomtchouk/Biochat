TITLE
Salmon Spawning Migration: Metabolic Shifts and Environmental Triggers

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
A large-scale functional genomics study revealed shifting energy generating processes in white muscle during the final 1,300 km migration of wild sockeye salmon to their spawning grounds in the Fraser River, British Columbia.  In 2006, Lower Adams stock sockeye salmon ceased feeding after passing the Queen Charlotte Islands, 850 km from the Fraser River.  Enhanced protein turnover and reduced transcription of actin, muscle contractile and heme-related proteins were early starvation responses in saltwater.   Arrival to the estuarine environment triggered massive protein turnover through induction of proteasoma and lysosomal proteolysis and protein biosynthesis, and a shift from anaerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.  Response to entry into freshwater was modest, with up-regulation of heat shock proteins and nitric oxide biosynthesis.  High river temperatures resulted in a strong defense/immune response and high mortalities in 50% of fish.  Arrival to the spawning grounds triggered further up-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and proteolysis, down-regulation of protein biosynthesis and helicase activity, and continued down-regulation of muscle proteins and most glycolytic enzymes.  However, sharp up-regulation of PFK-I indicated induction of glycolytic potential at the spawning grounds.   The identification of potential environmental cues triggering genome-wide transcriptional shifts in white muscle associated with migration and the strong activation of proteasomal proteolysis were both novel findings.
