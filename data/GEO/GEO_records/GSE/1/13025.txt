SUMMARY
Halibut fed two different diets containing either fishmeal(control) or 25-30% soybean meal for 20 days. Diets compared from fish (5) at day 1, day 10 and day 20 to follow the developement of the soybean-induced enteritis. All experimental samples run against universal RNA (cDNA prepared from 1 ug of a pooled universal RNA consisting of equal amounts of RNA from five developmental stages from hatching until post-metamorphosis). Keywords: Diet comparison over a time course, experimental diet compared to a reference.
