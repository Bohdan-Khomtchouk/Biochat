TITLE
Rearrangement of CRLF2 in B-progenitor and Down syndrome associated acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal aneuploidy and translocations are hallmarks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but many patients lack a recurring chromosomal alteration. Here we report a recurring interstitial deletion of the pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL that results in the expression of a novel fusion that juxtaposes the first non-coding exon of P2RY8 to the coding region of the CRLF2  (cytokine receptor like factor 2, or thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor) gene. The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was identified in 7% of B-ALL cases, and was very common in ALL associated with Down syndrome (55% of cases) and was associated with the presence of JAK mutations. The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion results in increased expression of CRLF2, a lymphoid signaling molecule that forms a heterodimeric complex with interleukin receptor 7 alpha. These findings identify a novel recurring chromosomal alteration in B-ALL, and suggest that perturbed CRLF2-mediated signaling is a key event in leukemogenesis in these cases.

DESIGN
Profiling of tumor acquired DNA copy number alterations in 2 patients with Down syndrome associated B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Matched tumor and normal DNA was used for each array hybridization in each case.
