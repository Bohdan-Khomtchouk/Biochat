TITLE
Thrombopoietin (TPO) protects against heart damage induced by doxorubicin and infarction in rat models

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to examine the mechanism of TPO on cardiac protection against DOX damage, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to delineate the TPO cardioprotective mechanism against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy
