TITLE
Homeobox gene IRX1 is a tumor suppressor gene in gastric carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the functon of IRX1 in gastric cancer, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify gene expression changes in three samples. We constructed the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-IRX1. The pEGFP-IRX1 expression vector was transfected into SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells by Lipofectamine 2000. The IRX1 protein was mainly observed in nuclei. Naive SGC7901 and empty vector pEGFP-N1 transfected cells were used as controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were compared between parental gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and cells transfected with pEGFP-IRX1 and pEGFP-N1.
