Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This series represents the effects of OVA, tg-IL-13, and direct effects of IL-13 on airway epithelial cells. Experiment Design: Type of experiment: comparison of three related murine models of asthma, 1) Ova model, 2) tg-IL-13 model, 3) IL-13/Epi model. Two control groups were used: PBS challenged mice to control for the effects of OVA and tg-IL-13+ and STAT6-/- mice as controls for tg-IL-13 and IL-13/Epi mice. Measurements were made in each model in two types of tissue samples, whole lung and tracheal perfusate. Experimental factors: Allergen vs sham challenge, natural STAT6 expression vs transgenic expression and no expression. The number of hybridizations performed in the experiment: 50 (25 whole lung and 25 tracheal perfusate). The type of reference used for the hybridizations, if any: Pooled reference from lung (whole lung or tracheal perfusate) from untreated wildtype mice. Hybridization design: two-color hybridizations with reference design. Each individual sample was hybridized to a separate array. Quality control steps taken: 5 experimental replicates per group. RNA integrity assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Arrays with low signals, high background, or high spatial variation rejected and corresponding samples reanalyzed. URL of any supplemental websites or database accession numbers:GEO ( accession number GSE1438). ********** Samples used, extract preparation and labeling: The origin of the biological sample: homogenized whole lung from mouse and perfusate of mouse trachea. Manipulation of biological samples and protocols used: Whole lungs mechanically homogenized in 7.0 ml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for total RNA collection. Tracheas perfused with lysis buffer (Qiagen Rneasy kit) for total RNA collection. Protocol for preparing the hybridization extract and labeling: Preparation of aminoallyl-UTP labeled whole lung cDNA was performed as described [1]. Total RNA from tracheal perfusate (1.0 - 1.5 g per sample) was amplified and labeled with aminoallyl-dUTP using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion). Labeled cRNAs were coupled to Cy3 or Cy5 dyes (CyScribe, Amersham Biosciences) and purified as described [1]. Labeling protocol(s): Coupled to Cy3 or Cy5.External controls (spikes): none. ********** Hybridization procedures and parameters: Hybridizations were performed as described [1] except Ambion SlideHyb Glass Array Hybridization Buffer #1 (neat concentration) was used as hybridization buffer and hybridizations were carried out for 40 h at 55 °C.  Following hybridization, arrays were washed in 1X SSC with 0.03% SDS (wash 1), 0.2X SSC (wash 2), and 0.05X SSC (wash 3) for five minutes for each wash. ********** Measurement data and specifications: Arrays were scanned using an Axon Genepix 4000B scanner and GenePix Pro Analysis 5.0 software; laser power 100%, 10 micron resolution, PMT optimized for each array. Data from GPR files are available from GEO ( accession number GSE1438).The “print-tip loess” normalization was used to correct for within-array dye and spatial effects and single channel quantile normalization was used to facilitate comparison between arrays. No background subtraction was performed. We used functions in the library marrayNorm of the R / Bioconductor package to perform these normalizations. After normalization we determined the log2 ratio of experimental sample intensity to reference sample intensity for each probe on each array. ********** Array Design: General array design Array design name: UCSF 10Mm Mouse v.2 Oligo Array (GEO GPL1089) and UCSF Gladstone 18K Mouse v.2 Oligo Array (GPL1196) Platform type: spotted oligonucleotides (70mers) Surface and coating specification: aminosilane coated glass slides Physical dimensions of array support (e.g. of slide): 25 x 75 x 1.0 mm Number of features on the array: GPL1089: 19152, GPL1196: 18240 (including empty and duplicate features) For production protocol, see Feature information is available from GEO (GSE1438). Reporters: synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides. Sequence and annotation information available from GEO (GPL1089 and GPL1196) Method of reporter preparation: synthesized by Operon. The spotting protocols used, including the array substrate, the spotting buffer, and any post-printing processing, including cross-linking: see additional treatment performed prior to hybridization: none. ********** Reference: 1.
