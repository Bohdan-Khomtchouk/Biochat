TITLE
MicroRNAs and mRNAs differentially expressed in 5 glioblastoma spheroid cultures upon ATRA treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified microRNAs and mRNAs differentially expressed in 5 glioblastoma spheroid cultures upon ATRA treatment.

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 5 glioblastoma spheroid cultures was used to acquire microRNA expression profiles, leading to the identification of differentially expressed microRNAs between untreated and ATRA-treated cultures. In this study, a set of 5 glioblastoma spheroid cultures was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 16,651 transcripts, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes between untreated and ATRA-treated cultures by Significance Analysis of Microarray data.
