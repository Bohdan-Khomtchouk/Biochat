TITLE
Mouse primary astrocytes: LCN2 protein treated vs. control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse primary astrocytes comparing control untreated astrocytes with astrocytes treated with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 micro gram/ml). Goal was to determine the effects of LCN2 treatment on global gene expression in astrocytes. A secreted protein lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been implicated in diverse cellular processes including cell morphology and migration. We have previously demonstrated that lcn2 mediates reactive astrocytosis. In order to further understand the role of lcn2 in the CNS, astrocyte transcriptome was analyzed following LCN2 treatment. Chemokines were the major group of genes upregulated by LCN2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control untreated astrocytes vs. LCN2 protein treated astrocytes. Biological replicates: 1 control replicates, 1 treated replicates.
