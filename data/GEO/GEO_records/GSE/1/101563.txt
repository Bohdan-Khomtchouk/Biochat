TITLE
miRNA expression of Tubulocystic Renal Cell Carcinoma (TC-RCC) cases

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Eleven TC-RCC cases were selected on the basis of the criteria defined by the 2012 Vancouver Classification of Renal Neoplasia and WHO 2016 classification criteria, and re-reviewed by a panel of expert renal pathologists. Two of these cases, TC-RCC#9 and #10, had a mixed tubulocystic and papillary histology and were macro-dissected into separate PRCC and TC-RCC components. The molecular basis of TC-RCC, and miRNA expression profile, is unknown. We therefore used Affymetrix miRNA v.2. arrays to elucidate the expression of these samples
