TITLE
cDNA microarray expression profile during fiber elongation between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Sea-island cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) has superior fiber quality properties such as length, fineness and strength, while Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is characterized by high yield. To reveal features of Upland cotton and Sea-island cotton fiber cells, differential genes expression profiles during fiber cell elongation and in secondary wall deposits were established using cDNA microarray technology. This research provides a valuable genomic resource to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cotton fiber development, and may ultimately lead to improvements in cotton fiber quality and yield.
