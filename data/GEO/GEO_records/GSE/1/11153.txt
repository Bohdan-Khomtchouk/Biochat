TITLE
Hydrogenomics of the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

ORGANISM
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus

SUMMARY
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus is an extremely thermophilic, Gram-positive anaerobe, which ferments cellulose-, hemicellulose- and pectin-containing biomass to acetate, CO2 and hydrogen. Its broad substrate range, high hydrogen-producing capacity, and ability to co-utilize glucose and xylose, make this bacterium an attractive candidate for microbial bioenergy production.  Glycolytic pathways and an ABC-type sugar transporter were significantly up-regulated during growth on glucose and xylose, indicating that C. saccharolyticus co-ferments these sugars unimpeded by glucose-based catabolite repression. The capacity to simultaneously process and utilize a range of carbohydrates associated with biomass feedstocks represents a highly desirable feature of a lignocellulose-utilizing, biofuel-producing bacterium. Keywords: substrate response
