TITLE
Adenovirus vs Mock Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human bronchial smooth muscle cells were either infected with empty adenoviral type 5 vector at 40 MOI for 4 days, or Mock infected.  Each sample set was then stimulated with a mixture of 10ng/mL IL-1beta, TNF-alfa, and gamma-IFN for 20 hours prior to RNA harvest.  RNA samples were split, and the series consists of 3 slides, 2 of which are dye flipped. Keywords: parallel sample
