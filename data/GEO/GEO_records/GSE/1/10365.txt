TITLE
Expression Data from NKDxIL15tg and IL15 tg NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NK cells from NKDxIL15tg mice spleens and bone marrow were purified by FACS.  NK cells from IL15tg mice spleens were purified by FACS. Gene expression differences were analyzed to identify genes involved in NK cell development. Keywords: cell type comparison
