TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis aba2-1 mutant, cyp707a1-1a2-1a3-1 triple mutant seeds, embryo and endosperm tissues

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in aba2-1, cyp707a1-1a2-1a3-1 triple mutants seeds, embryo and endosperm tissues

DESIGN
Freshly harvested seeds were imbibed in 8.5 cm Petri dishes containing two filter papers (approximately 7 cm diameter) and 2 mL of water and harvested. Dissection of embryo and endosperm from 24-h-imbibed seeds was carried out under a stereoscopic microscope. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
