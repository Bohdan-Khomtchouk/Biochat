TITLE
Expresson of CD271 HIGH and LOW populations in melanoma cells during invasion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human engeneered skin carrying GFP positive melanoma cells  was transplanted in immunocompromised rats. 6 weeks after transplatation the engeenered skin was removed and GFP positive melanoma cells sorted for CD271 HIGH and LOW populations

DESIGN
2 rats were transplanted, the 2 tranplants were then dissected and cell isolated by digestion. Melanoma cells were sorted for GFP Functional Genomic Center University of ZÃ¼rich Switzerland for Affymetrix and data analysis
