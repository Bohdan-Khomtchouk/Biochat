TITLE
Expression data from transgenic Aire expressing pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of transgenic Aire expression on the transcriptional profile of a tissue that normally does not express Aire: pancreatic islets. The transcriptional profile of transgenic RIP-Aire27 islets was compared to non-transgenic littermate islets as well as to archival NOD thymic medullary epithelial cells (MEC) data. All data were from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice Keywords: RIP-Aire transgenic vs non-transgenic comparison
