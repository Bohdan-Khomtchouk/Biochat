TITLE
Comparison of aortic and aortic valve endothelial cells in static and shear environments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Porcine aortic and aortic valve endothelial cells were exposed to 20 dynes/cm2 steady laminar shear stress with static cultures serving as controls.  Total RNA was hybridized to Agilent Human 1 cDNA arrays and processed using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software Keywords = aortic valve Keywords = endothelial Keywords = shear stress Keywords: other
