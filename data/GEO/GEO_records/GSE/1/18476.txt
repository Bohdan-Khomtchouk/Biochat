TITLE
Gene Expression Data from U937T:PLZF-RARa Inducible Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The PLZF-RARa fusion oncoprotein is overexpressed in the t(11;17) subtype of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Gene expression microarrays were used to identify genes involved in leukemic transformation. We used microarray to detect gene expression changes induced by the PLZF-RARa fusion oncoprotein in the U937 cell line
