TITLE
Analysis of Iron Deficiency in Soybean Leaf Tissue

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify candidate genes associated with iron efficiency in soybeans.  Two genotypes, Clark (PI548553) and IsoClark (PI547430), were grown in both iron sufficient (100uM Fe(NO3)3) and iron deficient (50uM Fe(NO3)3) hydroponics conditions.  The second trifoliate was harvested for RNA extraction for the microarray experiment.  Candidate genes were identified by comparing gene expression profiles within genotypes between the two iron growth conditions. Keywords: Stress Response
