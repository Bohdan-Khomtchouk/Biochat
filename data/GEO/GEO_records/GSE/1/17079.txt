TITLE
Early CCL2 and CXCL10 chemokine expression correlates with lung pathology in Pandemic H1N1 Influenza A infection

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Background: Pandemic H1N1 influenza A is a newly emerging strain of human influenza that is easily transmitted between people and has spread globally to over 116 countries. Human infection leads to symptoms ranging from mild to severe with lower respiratory complications observed in a small but significant number of infected individuals. Little is currently known about host immunity and Pandemic H1N1 influenza infections. Methods: We examined the pathogenic potential of the pandemic influenza A vaccine strain, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), in ferrets, and characterized the host immune responses using microarray analysis. Gene expression profiles in lung tissue were compared with those from ferrets infected with A/Brisbane/59/2007. Results: Chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CXCL7 and CXCL10 along with the majority of ISGs were expressed early, correlated to lung pathology, and abruptly decreased expression in 5 days. Interestingly, the drop in innate immune gene expression was replaced by a significant increase in the expression of the adaptive immune genes for granzymes and immunoglobulins. Serum anti-pandemic influenza H1N1 antibodies were also observed on day 7, commensurate with the elimination of viral load. Conclusions: We propose that the innate phase of host immunity causes lung pathology and a delay or failure to effectively switch to the adaptive phase contributes to morbidity and mortality during severe human pandemic H1N1 influenza A infections.
