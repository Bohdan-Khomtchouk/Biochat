TITLE
circRNA expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and matched non-fibrotic plasma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used circRNA microArray analysis from Arraystar to identify differential expression of circRNA in IPF patients compared to healthy controls.

DESIGN
The plasmas were distributed into two experimental groups: control group and test group, then perform circRNAs chips by Arraystar Human circRNA Array (8Ã—15 K, Arraystar)
