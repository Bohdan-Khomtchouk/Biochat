TITLE
Gene and exon expression of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell under Mimic Hypoxia Stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were insulted with cobalt chloride to induce cell apoptosis and alternative splicing in the mimic-hypoxia environment. We use Affymetrix exon array to reveal differential expression from transcript-level and exon-level in genome-wide.
