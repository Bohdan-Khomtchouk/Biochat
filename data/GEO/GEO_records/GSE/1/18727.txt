TITLE
Gene expression profile of bone marrow with post-irradiation radioprotector

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanism of the in vivo radioprotection activity of Zn-containing heat-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (Zn-yeast), expression changes in bone marrow after whole body irradiation (WBI) with concomitant treatment of Zn-yeast were analyzed using microarray technology. Keywords: mouse, bone marrow, Zn-containing heat-treated yeast administration, gamma-irradiation

DESIGN
Zn-yeast suspension was administered i.p. into C3H mice immediately after 7.5 Gy WBI. Bone marrow from irradiated mice was extracted at 6 hours after irradiation and analyzed by microarray containing of 44,000 probes.
