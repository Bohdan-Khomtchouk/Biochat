TITLE
Disease-specific expression of host genes during downy mildew infection of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we report on the identification of Arabidopsis genes that are induced during compatible but not during incompatible interactions with the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. This set of so-called compatible specific (CS) genes contrasts the large group of defence-associated genes that is differentially expressed during both compatible and incompatible interactions. From the 17 identified CS-genes, 6 belong to the ERF family of transcription factor genes, suggesting that these ERFs have a role during compatibility. The majority of CS-genes are differentially regulated in response to various forms of abiotic stress. In silico analysis of the CS-genes revealed an over-representation of DREB1A/CBF3 binding sites and EveningElement motifs in their promoter regions. The CS-ERFs are closely related to the CBF transcription factors and could potentially bind the DREB1A/CBF3 promoter elements in the CS-genes. Transcript levels of CS-genes peak at 2-3 days post inoculation, when pathogen growth is highest, and decline at later stages of infection. The induction of several CS-genes was found to be isolate-dependant. This suggests that the identified CS-genes could be the direct or indirect targets of downy mildew effector proteins that promote disease susceptibility.

DESIGN
Compatible interaction - Arabidopsis Ler inoculated with Cala2 compared to Ler with mock inoculation with 3 biological replicates. Each biological replicate is analysed by 4 technical dyeswapped replicates. Incompatible interaction - Arabidopsis Ler inoculated with Waco9 compared to Ler with mock inoculation with 3 biological replicates. Each biological replicate is analysed by 4 technical dyeswapped replicates.
