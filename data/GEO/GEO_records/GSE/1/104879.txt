TITLE
Genomic instability induced by furfural-treated in S. cerevisiae [whole genome]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Furfural is a key inhibitor in S. cerevisiae fermentation causing serious economic loss. To understand the toxic mechanisms of furfural-induced genomic instability and phenotypic evolution, we mapped chromosomal alterations in 21 furfural-treated yeast strains by whole genome SNP microarrays at a resolution about 1kb.

DESIGN
Using whole genome SNP microarrays, we analyzed genomic alterations in 21 yeast strains treated with 2% furfural for 2h repeated for 18 generations to accumulate genomic alterations. For each generation, after furfural treatment, cells were streaked on YPDA plates and cultured at 30 degree for 2 days to form single colony for the next round furfural treatment.
