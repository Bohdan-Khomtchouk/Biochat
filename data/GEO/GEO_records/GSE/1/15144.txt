TITLE
miRNA profiling of normal mature B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling has been performed on normal mature B cells at different stages of differentiation (naive, germinal center and memory).  The main goal is to identify miRNA signatures associated with differentiation stages of normal B cells. Keywords: miRNA, normal mature B cells

DESIGN
Cells were isolated by magnetic cell sorting from tonsil tissues obtained from pediatric donors. Each phenotype is represented by 6 samples, each isolated from a different donor. The experiment does not include technical replicates.
