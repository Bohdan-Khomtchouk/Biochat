SUMMARY
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a hematopoietic malignant disease characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(15;17), resulting in the formation of the PML-RARA gene.  Here, 47 t(15;17) APL samples were analyzed with high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray (50K and 250K SNP-chips) using the new algorithm AsCNAR (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references).  Copy-number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) was identified at chromosome 10q (3 cases), 11p (3 cases) and 19q (1 case).  Twenty-eight samples (60%) did not have an obvious alteration (normal-copy-number [NC] group).  Nineteen samples (40%) showed either one or more genomic abnormalities: 8 samples (17%) had trisomy 8 either with or without an additional duplication, deletion, or CNN-LOH (+8 group); and 11 samples (23%) had genomic abnormalities without trisomy 8 (other abnormalities group).  These chromosomal abnormalities were acquired somatic mutations.  Interestingly, FLT3-ITD mutations (11/47 cases) only occurred in the group with no genomic alteration (NC group).  Taken together, these results suggest that the pathway of development of APL differs in each group: FLT3-ITD, trisomy 8, and other genomic changes.  Here, we showed for the first time hidden abnormalities and novel disease-related genomic changes in t(15;17) APL. Keywords: SNP-chip
