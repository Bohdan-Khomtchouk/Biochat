TITLE
Predator induced gene expression in tadpoles

ORGANISM
Rana pirica

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail. The tadpoles revert to a normal phenotype upon removal of the larval salamander threat.  The objective of the present study was to use our own fabricated tadpole Rana pirica cDNA microarray to profile gene expression patterns during the predation threat.
