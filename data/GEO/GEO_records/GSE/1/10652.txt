SUMMARY
Experimental Design: 1. The goal of the experiment: Age-Related Genome Expression Profiles During Hepatic Ischemia 2. Brief description of the experiment: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complication of liver surgery, transplantation and shock and differs with age.  In the present study, we sought to determine if the age-dependent response to I/R injury was related to differential gene expression during the ischemic period.  Total RNA of young (4-5 weeks) and adult (12-14 months) mice undergoing sham surgery or partial hepatic ischemia for 30, 60, or 90 minutes was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray.  Gene expression was filtered based on a change in expression of 1.5-fold relative to respective controls and then analyzed by ANOVA.  Significant differences in gene expression were observed between age groups.  In young mice, 169 genes were down-regulated, whereas adult mice had 1167 genes down-regulated.  Of these, only 28 genes were down-regulated in both young and adult mice.  Far fewer genes had increased expression during ischemia.  Sixty genes in young mice and 51 genes in adult mice were up-regulated.  Of those, none were up-regulated in both young and adult mice.  There were no distinct functional patterns of gene regulation in either age group.  The data demonstrate significant and widespread changes in hepatic gene expression during the ischemic period that may be important to the age-dependent response to I/R injury.
