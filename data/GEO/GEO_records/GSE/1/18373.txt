TITLE
Expression data of HUVEC and OVCA429 with recombinant MAGP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of signaling events contributing to the effect of recombinant MAGP2 on HUVECs and OVCA429. We used microarrays to identify the signaling events and up-regulated genes associated with MAGP2.

DESIGN
To explore the consequences of recMAGP2-induced signaling in ovarian cancer, microarrays were completed for a series of recMAGP2-treated (n=3) and untreated (n=3) HUVEC and OVCA429 cells. The supplementary files 'GSE18373_diff_exp_HUVEC.txt' and 'GSE18373_diff_exp_OVCA429.txt' contain differentially expressed genes for Samples GSM458345-GSM458350 and GSM458351-GSM458356, respectively.
