Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satellite cells play an important role in post-natal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle. They can be defined as a population adult muscle stem cells based on their self renewal capability and ability to differentiate into skeletal muscle fibers. Functional Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is essential for the process of skeletal muscle differentiation in satellite cell derived primary myoblasts. Furthermore, the biochemical function of pRb is largely associated with its ability to interact with chromatin modifying factors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases thus inhibiting transcription of target gene promoters. Hence, expression profiling of pRb null primary myoblasts and myotubes will provide a global picture of the downstream targets of pRb transcriptional regulation in relation to cell cycle control, apoptosis inhibition, and muscle differentiation.
