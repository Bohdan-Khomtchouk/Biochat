TITLE
EYA4 is a non-small cell lung cancer tumor suppressor located in the susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken to identify novel tumour suppressor genes in lung adenocarcinoma.  EYA4, located at 6q23.2 was identified as a frequently lost and hypermethylated gene in the analyzed samples.  EYA4 is underexpressed in addition to being deleted and hypermethylated.  Control of EYA4 expression by DNA methylation was assessed using 5'-azacytidine.  The role of EYA4 in apoptosis was assessed using a stable knock down of the gene which was assessed for apoptotis using FACS and qPCR.

DESIGN
Methylation profiling: 30 adenocarcinoma samples and 30 patient-matched non-malignant lung samples are included.  Non-malignant samples were used as references to identify hypermethylated probes.  For each normal/tumor pair, the sample numbers are paired but offset by one with the tumor being the lower of the two numbers.  For example, 85040001 is the adenocarcinoma tumor profile that pairs with non-malignant 85040002. Genome variation (aCGH) profiling: 30 adenocarcinoma gene dosage profiles are included.  Values presented are log2 ratios of Cy3(sample)/Cy5(diploid reference)
