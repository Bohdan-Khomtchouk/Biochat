TITLE
Analysis of the role of CggR in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and WCFS1 by transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
The level of the Central glycolytic gene regulator (CggR) was engineered in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and WCFS1 by over-expression and in-frame mutation of the cggR gene in order to evaluate its regulatory role on the glycolytic gap operon and the glyco
