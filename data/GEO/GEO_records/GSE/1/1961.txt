TITLE
Connexin43 null vs wildtype neonatal mouse HEART

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cy3-labeled cDNA obtained from four pools of three hearts of neonatal C57BL Cx43 null mice were compared to Cy3-labeled cDNA obtained from four pools of three hearts of neonatal C57BL wildtype mice through Cy5-labeled sample reference prepared at once for the entire experiment from aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary/testicles, spleen, and stomach - equal amounts from adult male and female C57BL mice. Keywords = Cx32 null vs wildtype neonatal mouse heart Keywords: parallel sample
