TBP ChIP-chip on Jurkat cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During mitosis, TATA-binding protein(TBP), which remains bound to DNA during mitosis, recruits PP2A and also interacts with a subunit of the condensin complex to allow efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin near these promoters to inhibit their compaction. These result suggest that TBP function is not only important for expression of genes transcribed bDuring mitosis, TATA-binding protein(TBP), which remains bound to DNA during mitosis, recruits PP2A and also interacts with a subunit of the condensin complex to allow efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin near these promoters to inhibit their compaction. These result suggest that TBP function is not only important for expression of genes transcribed by all three RNA polymerase during interphase, but also for transmitting the memory of gene activity through mitosis to daughter cellsy all three RNA polymerase during interphase, but also for transmitting the memory of gene activity through mitosis to daughter cells
