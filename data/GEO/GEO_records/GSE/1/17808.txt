TITLE
DnaN causes overinitiation of DNA replication

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Overexpression of DnaN causes the accumulation of origin of replication proximal DNA.

DESIGN
comparing the genome profile of cells before and after DnaN overexpression we see an increase in the amount of origin specific DNA, which is typical of replication overinitiation
