TITLE
Mili-IP, Miwi-IP, and total RNA from mouse adult testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We deep-sequenced small RNAs after immunoprecipitation of Mili or Miwi, as well as total small RNA from adult mouse testis.  The goal of this experiment is to more deeply characterize the piRNA pool from adult mouse testes, using the Illumina platform.

DESIGN
Comparison of 2 IP libraries with a non-IP library
