TITLE
Novel genes in Sitka spruce associated with wood density identified from global transcriptomic analysis

ORGANISM
Picea

SUMMARY
The current study uses a transcriptomic approach to identify genes associated with differences in wood density, that are likely to be of value as candidate genes in Sitka breeding programmes for improved wood density. Following extensive wood density analysis from a Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) field grown clonal trial, three detailed microarray studies were conducted to compare the transcriptome of cambial tissue from contrasting clonal lines with high and low wood density. Twenty five genes exhibited differential expression, reaching as high as 50 fold, in at least two of the three microarray experiments and this was verified using real-time PCR. Identified genes functioned in cell wall synthesis, transcriptional regulation and plant pathogen defence, amongst others. These results confirm the importance of previously-identified density-related genes, and highlight a number of novel genes with a putative role in wood quality. A wide range of processes influence wood density, but this study has allowed the identification of potential regulators in these pathways. Future studies may now use this information to understand the control of natural variation in wood density, and manipulate the expression of these genes to improve timber quality.
