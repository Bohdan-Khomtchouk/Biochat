TITLE
Stress-related gene expression of HK-2 cells exposed to GF/FAF HSA, GF HSA, AngII or AngII+Cand

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proteinuria is pathogenic to proximal tubular cells (PTC) and linked with progression to renal failure. Angiotensin II (AngII) is also independently involved in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury in varied kidney disease. The effects of human serum albumin (HSA) overload, AngII and candesartan, a specific inhibitor of AngII type 1 recptor, on the changes in gene protein expression stimulated by oxidative stress in PTC were assesed using cDNA microarrays. Keywords: stress response
