TITLE
Gene expression changes in the human diaphragm following cardiothoracic surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is unknown how soon the diaphragm begins to start the process of atrophy following the start of MV. We hypothesized that genes responsible for maintaining diaphragmatic contractile function, stress response, energy transduction would be altered over the course of a 5 hour cardiothoracic surgery.
