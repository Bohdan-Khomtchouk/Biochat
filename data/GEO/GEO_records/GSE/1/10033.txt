TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus strain SH1000 wildtype vs mepR

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
MepR is a substrate-responsive repressor of mepR and mepA, which encode itself and a MATE family multidrug efflux pump.  Microarray analyses of Staphylococcus aureus SH1000 and its mepR-disrupted derivative revealed changes in expression of many genes in addition to mepR and mepA, notably several involved in virulence Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, MATE efflux pump, MepR
