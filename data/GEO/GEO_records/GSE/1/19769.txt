TITLE
miRNA expression signatures for human stomach biopsy samples, H. pylori positive versus negative

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole microRNA microarray with the potential to distinguish H.pylori infection.Among the 470 human miRNAs represented on the array chip, 228 were undetectable or expressed below the background and so were eliminated, leaving 242 miRNAs for the supervised analysis. When comparing 10 H. pylori-negative and nine H. pylori-positive subjects, 55 miRNAs were deemed significantly different on the basis of microRNA arrays.

DESIGN
During endoscopy, a biopsy specimen was obtained from the gastric antrum along the lesser curvature. Biopsies of 10 H. pylori-negative and nine H. pylori-positive patients' subjects were performed.Exclusion criteria were: age < 18 or > 80 y, pregnancy, body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, cachectic state (including cancer), systemic infection, liver disease, renal impairment, use of medications effective against H. pylori during the preceding 3 months, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, and chronic corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. None of the subjects had undergone gastrointestinal surgery.
