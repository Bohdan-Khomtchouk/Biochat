TITLE
ChIP-chip from different B cell stages with Abs to H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K9,K14-diacetyl, H3K27me3 and RNA polymerase II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cell differentiation stage specific histone modifications detected within and upstream of genes that play critical roles in B cell differentation. Germinal center B cell stage specific activating histone marks in regions far upstream of the BCL6 promoter regulate BCL6 expression.

DESIGN
comparison of histone modifications of genes having a role in B cell differentiation in human primary tonsillar na√Øve B-cells and germinal center B-cells and in CL01, SUDHL16 and U266 cell lines.
