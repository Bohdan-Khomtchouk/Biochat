Post-alcoholism and post-hepatitis C cirrhosis

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to compare post-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and post-alcoholism cirrhosis gene expression profiling. By transcriptome analysis with a cDNA array virtually covering every transcript in liver, we compared transcript levels in alcoholic- , HCV-cirrhosis and control liver. A stringent selection identified a list of 70 transcripts which completely separated the 3 groups of patients (7 HCV-cirrhosis, 7 alcoholic cirrhosis and 8 control livers). In contrast, in an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) context, comparison of 10 HCV-cirrhosis, 10 alcoholic cirrhosis and the 8 control livers failed to identify such transcripts. We report that dysregulations at the transcriptional level do exist in HCC-free cirrhosis, are transiently observed prior to detectable HCC. Keywords: etiology-dependent and HCC-dependent analysis
