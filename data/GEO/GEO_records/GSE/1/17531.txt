TITLE
Distribution of macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 at gene promoters in NT2/D1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chip-on-chip experiment with NT2 wildtype cells and cells treated with shRNA for macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 The goal was to determine the genome-wide occupancy of macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 at gene promoters in undifferentiated cells
