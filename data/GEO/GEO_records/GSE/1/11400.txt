TITLE
Gene Expression Data in R26Pax3 palates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying palate development by persistent expression in R26Pax3 mice and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: palate development
