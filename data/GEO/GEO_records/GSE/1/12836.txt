TITLE
PDGF-B induces a homogeneous class of oligodendrogliomas from embryonic neural progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the generation of mouse gliomas following the overexpression of PDGF-B in embryonic neural progenitors. Comparison of our microarray data, with published gene expression data sets for many different murine neural cell types, revealed a closest relationship between our tumor cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, confirming definitively that PDGF-B-induced gliomas are pure oligodendrogliomas.
