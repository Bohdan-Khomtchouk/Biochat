TITLE
Gene expression in GLN versus PDLN in NOD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the gene expression in the two pancreatic lymph nodes: gastric lymph node (GLN) and pancreatico-duodenal lymph node (PDLN) in NOD mice. The analysis was done in an attempt to explain the preferential homing of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to the GLN after intravenous injection.

DESIGN
GLN and PDLN were excised from 4 individual 12-wk old female NOD mice and RNA was extracted after tissue homogenization in Trizol for processing onto microarray (Agilent 4x44K). Each array corresponds to one single mouse, thus this study comprise 4 biological replicates.
