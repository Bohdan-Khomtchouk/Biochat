TITLE
Gene expression profiles in Elastin (Eln+/-) mouse aorta and aortic valve tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Elastin wild type Eln+/+ and Eln+/- mouse aorta and aortic valve tissue.  In the study, we demonstrated differential gene expression in juvenile elastin deficient mouse valve tissue.

DESIGN
In the study, we hybridized RNA from Elastin wild type (Eln+/+) aorta tissue, elastin wild type (Eln+/+) aortic valve tissue, elastin (Eln+/-) aorta tissue and elastin (Eln+/-) aortic valve tissue to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
