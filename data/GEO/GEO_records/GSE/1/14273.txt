TITLE
The target genes of transcript factor ZNF191

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human embryo kidney cells comparing control HEK293 transfected with empty vectors cells with HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-ZNF191 (or ZNF191 siRNA vector). We searched for early ZNF191 target genes by using a transient overexpression and knockdown strategy in the human embryo kidney (HEK293) cells. A table of gene targets of transcription factor ZNF191 commonly identified by both strategies is appended below as a supplementary file.
