TITLE
Gene microarray analysis of mouse-brain endothelial cells exposure to Pertussis Toxin and B-oligomer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pertussis Toxin (PTX) regulated inflammatory and angiogenesis-related transcripts in endothelial cells from mouse brain(MBEC). Of ~14,000 mouse genes tracked, 34 showed altered expression in response to PTX, and most of these changes were dependent on the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the S1 subunit of the active holotoxin. More than one third of these genes have roles in inflammation and angiogenesis. Keywords: response to treatment
