TITLE
Effects of Caveolin 1 knockout in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In conjunction with other techniques, the role of caveolin-1 in lipid metabolism was assayed by comparing the gene expression of three tissues in Cav1+/+ and Cav1-/- mice. The tissues assayed were liver, adipose tissue, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) primary cell line, collected 24 hours after plating.    The MEFs were selected to give insights into the fundamental cellular functions of Cav1.    The adipose tissue and liver were selected because they are the most important tissues or organs involved the control of the lipid metabolism in mammals. Both of them were study during fasting because lipid metabolism become essential for maintaining of mammal metabolism homeostasis and tissue/organ functions in animals.

DESIGN
Pairwise comparisons of WT-KO for each of the three tissues.
