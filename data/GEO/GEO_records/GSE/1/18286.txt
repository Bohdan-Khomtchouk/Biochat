TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of (1) chemically reprogrammed iPS cells, and (2) chemical-treated cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPS cells generated with a small molecule, RepSox (RS), as well as a time-course of gene expression changes in cells treated with RS. The former was done to verify the similarity of the iPS cells with mES cells; the latter was aimed at elucidating the mechanism of drug action in the context of reprogramming.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from iPS cells compared with mES and fibroblasts; total RNA obtained from untreated cells compared with RepSox-treated cells at various timepoints.
