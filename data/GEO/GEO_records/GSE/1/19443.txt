TITLE
Blood Transcriptional Profiles of Active TB (UK Test Set Separated)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset aims to dissect the whole blood transcriptional signature by determining if elements of the whole blood signature are still present in purified cell subpopulations. We aimed to characterise the transcriptional response during TB and identify if cell subsets drove changes in whole blood cellular composition.  The aim of the experiment was to define transcriptional signatures in neutrophils, monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ cells from blood of active TB patients and healthy controls to distinguish the signature of  active TB patients from each other and from healthy controls. This will help in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis, which normally relies on culture of the bacilli, which can take up to 6 weeks, sometimes the bacilli cannot be obtained from sputum thus requiring invasive techniques obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In some cases the bacill cannot be grown from sputum or BAL.
