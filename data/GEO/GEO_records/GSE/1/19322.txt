TITLE
Expression data from C57BL/6J and MRL/MpJ hearts following acute myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Murphy Roth Large (MRL) mouse, a strain capable of regenerating right ventricular myocardium, has a high post-myocardial infarction (MI) survival rate compared with C57BL6/J (C57) mice. The biological processes responsible for this survival advantage are unknown. We compared acute post-MI gene expression in C57 and MRL hearts using microarrays and identified promising candidate biological processes underlying increased survival in the MRL.

DESIGN
Hearts from both strains were excised at different time points before or after MI for RNA extraction and hybridization to MOE430A arrays. Baseline hearts were excised from healthy mice that had not undergone the MI procedure (day 0). Infarct tissue in this case means tissue taken from the anterior-apical region that would be the infarct region in a post-MI heart. Non-infarct covers the remainder of the LV. Post-MI hearts were excised either 1 or 5 days after MI. We had successful hybridizations for 3 replicates each of C57 day 0 infarct and non-infarct tissue (6 arrays), 4 MRL day 0 infarct and non-infarct tissue (8 arrays), 4 C57 day 1 infarct and non-infarct tissue (8 arrays), 4 MRL day 1 infarct and non-infarct tissue (8 arrays), 4 C57 day 5 infarct and non-infarct tissue (8 arrays), and 4 MRL day 5 infarct and non-infarct tissue (8 arrays).
