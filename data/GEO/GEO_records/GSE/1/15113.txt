TITLE
Distinct DNA methylation profiles between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of human uterine cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray-based strategy using digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII, ligation, and PCR, was performed to assess the DNA methylation status of promoter regions in Six human cervical adenocarcinomas (ACA) and four squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Two array platforms were used; an array of 11,994 ~1.5kb PCR products from 10,445 promoter regions, and an array of 355,264 oligonucleotides for 18,212 HpaII fragments in 12,617 promoter regions. Loci near 21 genes showed significant differences between ACA and SCC. Real time PCR-based validation was performed on 13 loci using other nearby candidate methylation targets in the same promoter. Methylation patterns of eleven of these 13 linked loci concurred with the microarray results. Four loci were further studied using tissues from additional patients. Hyper-methylation of loci in PAK6 and NOGOR most strongly correlated with adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
In this project, we investigated the promoter methylation status in human cervical adenocarcinoma (ACA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to identify genes with tumor type-specific promoter DNA methylation patterns. Six ACA and four SCC tissue specimens from bulky tumor masses (clinical stage Ib2- IIb) were selected to minimize contamination from normal tissues. Another set of hybridizations was performed using an in situ synthesized high-resolution oligonucleotide microarray (NimbleGen Inc), to increase the reliability of the data. This chip was designed to cover the same promoters as the in-house microarray. Four pools of samples were used to reduce the number of arrays used. These pools consisted of two sets of three ACA samples (total of six ACA samples) and two sets of two SCC samples (total of four SCC samples).
