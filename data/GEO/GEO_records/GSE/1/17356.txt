TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer epithelial cells from African American and European American men

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
African-American (AA) men experience increased risk of developing prostate cancers as well as increased mortality following treatment as compared to European-American (EA) men. The aim of our study was to identify biological factors with potential to predispose AA men to prostate tumor progression and metastasis. High-throughput microarrays were used to investigate differences in global gene expression comparing the two groups.

DESIGN
To identify cancer-specific gene expression patterns in AA men, we established primary prostate cancer epithelial cells from 14 AA and 13 EA men. Cells were cultured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
