TITLE
Drosophila Gene Expression During Metamorphosis in Wild Type and Germline Minus Pupae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila melanogaster undergoes a complete metamorphosis, during which time the larval male and female forms transition into sexually dimorphic, reproductive adult forms. To understand this complex morphogenetic process at a molecular-genetic level, we performed whole genome microarray analyses. Genes were identified that were expressed during metamorphosis in both somatic and germline tissues of males and females.  Additionally, genes were identified that display sex-specific differences in abundance in both of these tissues at discrete times during metamorphosis. Keywords: time course; wild type; genetic modification;
