TITLE
Ovarian Cancer gene expression profiling identifies the surface of the ovary as a stem cell niche

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In contrast to epithelial derived carcinomas that arise in most human organs, ovarian surface epithelial cells become more rather than less differentiated as the malignancy progresses. To test the hypothesis that ovarian surface epithelial cells retain properties of relatively uncommitted pluripotent cells until undergoing neoplastic transformation, we conducted gene expression profiling analysis (Affymetrix, U133 Plus 2.0) of 12 ovarian surface epithelial cells and 12 laser capture microdissected serous papillary ovarian cances. We find that over 2000 genes are significantly differentially expressed between the surface epithelial and cancer samples. Network analysis implicates key signaling pathways and pathway interactions in ovarian cancer development. Genes previously associated with adult stem cell maintenance are expressed in ovarian surface epithelial cells and significantly down-regulated in ovarian cancer cells. Our results indicate that the surface of the ovary is an adult stem cell niche and that deregulation of genes involved in maintaining the quiescence of ovarian surface epithelial cells is instrumental in the initiation and development of ovarian cancer.
