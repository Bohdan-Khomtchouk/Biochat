TITLE
The Circadian Clock Gene Bmal1 Controls Thyroid Hormone-Mediated Spectral Identity and Cone Photoreceptor Function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we reveal a novel role for the circadian clock gene Bmal1 and Period2 in regulating the spatial organization of the cone opsins. Deletion of Bmal1 and Per2 have opposing effects on S-opsin expression and patterning of the cone photoreceptors is disrupted in cone specific knockouts of these genes. Using ChIP analysis we show that BMAL1 directly binds to the promoter region of the thyroid activating enzyme type II deiodinase (Dio2).

DESIGN
3 WT vs 3 Bmal1 CKO mice were compared
