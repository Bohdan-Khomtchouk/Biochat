TITLE
Chronic hyperglycemia impairs metabolic switching of human myotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle of insulin resistant individuals is characterized by lower fasting lipid oxidation and reduced ability to switch between lipid and glucose oxidation. The purpose of the present study was to examine if impaired metabolic switching could be induced by chronic hyperglycemia. Human myotubes were treated with or without chronic hyperglycemia (HG) (20 mmol/l glucose for 4 days), and the metabolism of [14C]oleic acid (OA) and [14C]glucose was studied. Acute glucose (5mmol/l) suppressed OA oxidation by 50% in normoglycemic (NG) (5.5 mmol/l glucose) cells. Myotubes exposed to chronic hyperglycemia showed a significantly reduced OA uptake and oxidation to CO2, whereas acid-soluble metabolites were increased. Glucose suppressibility, the ability of acute glucose to suppress lipid oxidation, was significantly reduced to 21%, while adaptability, the capacity to increase lipid oxidation with increasing fatty acid availability, was unaffected. Glucose uptake and oxidation was significantly reduced by about 40%. Substrate oxidation in presence of mitochondrial uncouplers showed that net and maximal oxidative capacities were significantly reduced after hyperglycemia, and the concentration of ATP was reduced by 25%. However, none of the measured mitochondrial genes were downregulated nor was mitochondrial content. Microarray showed that no genes were significantly regulated by chronic hyperglycemia. Addition of chronic lactate reduced both glucose and OA oxidation to the same extent as hyperglycemia, and this effect was specific for lactate. In conclusions, chronic hyperglycemia reduced substrate oxidation in skeletal muscle cells and impaired the metabolic switching. The effect is most likely due to an induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
