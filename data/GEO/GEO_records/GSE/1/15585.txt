TITLE
Expression data from differentiating ventral otic Epithelial Cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study of the gene expression during otic development is a source of important information for understanding the mechanism of inner ear development and subsequently create appropriate gene therapies both to prevent hearing loss and eventually to regenerate the damaged parts.This dataset contains data from temporal expression profiles in an epithelial cell line derived from the cochlear duct of a mouse inner ear at embryonic day E10.5. There are 6 time points across 14 days of in vitro differentiation in serum-free media. We used microarrays to define patterns of expression in a differentiating otic cell line. Keywords: Temporal gene expression of 14 days of differentiation in vitro.
