TITLE
Ecdysone Response Timecourse in Kc Cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Kc167 Cells were plated at 0.5x106/ml and grown at 23.50C. They were treated with 20-HE (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5x10-7M. The reference sample was total RNA isolated at 0 hr. after treatment. The experimental samples were total RNA isolated from cells treated for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours.
