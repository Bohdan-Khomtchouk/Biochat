TITLE
Microarray analysis for Streptococcus pyogenes M1-CdhA (-) mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
A total of 163 genes were found to be differentially expressed; 38 genes of them were up regulated and 125 genes were down regulated. Most notably the functional categories that were affected include Virulence genes (18 genes  11% of the total significantly differentiated genes), carbohydrate metabolism  and cell envelop realted genes ( 31, 19.1% of the total),  and aminoacid transport genes (21genes, 12.9%).  Among the virulence-related genes, the most notable one were those belong to the production of capsule, the M protein, exotoxin, NAD glycohydrolase and Streptolysin S. Some of the capsule related genes were down regulated by more than 64 fold. These results indicate that CdhA (group A Streptococcal Cell division controlling and Chain-forming cell wall hydrolase) plays an important role in the regulation of virulence.
