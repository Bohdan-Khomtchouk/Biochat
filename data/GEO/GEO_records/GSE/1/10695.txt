TITLE
Gene expression profiling of liver from dairy cows subjected to intra-mammary LPS treatment: time course

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Liver plays a profound role in the acute phase response (APR) observed in the early phase of acute bovine mastitis caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). To gain an insight into the genes and pathways involved in hepatic APR of dairy cows we performed a global gene expression analysis of liver tissue sampled at different time points before and after intra-mammary (IM) exposure to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Keywords: Time course
