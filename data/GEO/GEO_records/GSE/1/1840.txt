TITLE
Identification of central nervous system genes involved in the host response to the scrapie agent.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we identified genes differentially expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice during infection with mouse-adapted scrapie agents. We used cDNA microarrays to examine gene expression profiles at early, mid (pre-clinical) and late (clinical) time points after inoculation. Keywords = scrapie Keywords = prion Keywords = CNS Keywords = BMAP Keywords: other
