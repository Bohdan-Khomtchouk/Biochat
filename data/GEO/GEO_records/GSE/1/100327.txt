TITLE
RNA-sequencing profiles of five different pancreas cancer cell lines that were engineered to express a form of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, E47, that localizes to the nucleus in response to tamoxifen.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
E47 had been shown previously to inhibit cell cycle progression in pancreas cancer cell lines. This study was designed to identify global changes in gene expression that occurred in response to E47 with the goal of identifying molecular mechanisms involved inE47-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from No Tamoxifen (NT) and With Tamoxifen (WT) treated samples 48-72 hrs after induction of nuclear E47, sequenced and analyzed to identify candidate regulators of cell cycle inhibition that were common to all five cell lines examined.
