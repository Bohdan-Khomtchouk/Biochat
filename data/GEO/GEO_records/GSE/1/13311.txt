TITLE
Whole genome analysis of nicotine-exposed cells from the brainstem of spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar Kyoto rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The development of hypertension may be highly influenced by the use of nicotine especially in genetically susceptible subjects. In this study the effects of nicotine on gene expression of cultured cells from the brainstem of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were evaluated using whole genome microarray platforms. It was described for the first time that nicotine may act differentially on the gene expression profile of SHR and WKY. The influence of strain was present in 348 genes that were differentially expressed in SHR as compared to WKY brainstem cells independently of the nicotine treatment. 176 genes had their expression altered in both strains after nicotine exposure. Interaction between nicotine treatment and the strain was observed for the expression of 269 genes which participate of cellular pathways related to neurotrabnsmitter secretion, intracellular trafficking and cell communication. In conclusion, this study leaves a list of genes whose expression shall be better studied since they are good candidates to the phenotypic differentiation between SHR and WKY, including hypertension as well as demonstrated that alterations in the systems of intracellular trafficking and neurotransmission may be relevant to the development of hypertension.
