TITLE
The modulation of GBE50 and Lovastatin to cultured HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to investigate the modulation of GBE on cellular cholesterol metabolism which has been suggested in recent studies. To explore the molecular mechanisms gain insights into the molecular network, we used microarray to high-throughput measurement of genes concerning both spatial and temporal levels to understand the complexity and dynamics of cells in response to GBE and Lovastatin, the genes expression pattern were similar between GBE and Lovastatin treatment in HepG2 cells, the major changed genes were involved in biosynthesis of steroids and cell cycle. Cholesterol metabolism related genes were further examined by RT-PCR and western blot, showing that the cholesterogenic genes were upregulated in response to the reduction of cholesterol and were consistent with the microarray findings. Keywords: time course
