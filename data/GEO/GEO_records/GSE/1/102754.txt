TITLE
The Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Ws-2) and CLAVATA1 (clv1.12 and clv1.13) mutant transcriptomes upon the compatible interaction with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations in wild-type plants and clv mutants, 3 days after water treatment and inoculation with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis.

DESIGN
In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the wild-type Wassilewskija (Ws-2) ecotype and from two allelic clv (clv1.12 and clv1.13) mutants were treated with water, or inoculated with the H. arabidopsidis isolate Emwa1 to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at 3 days after onset of treatment.
