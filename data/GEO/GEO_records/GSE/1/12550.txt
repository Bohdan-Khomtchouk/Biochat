TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We differentiated mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells spontaneously into embryoid bodies (EBs). Gene expression of biological replicates of undifferentiated ES cells (0-day), 4-day, 8-day and 14-day EBs were measured by Affymetrix microarrays. Keywords: time course
