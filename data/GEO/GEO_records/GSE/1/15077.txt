TITLE
microRNA expression in bone marrow cells from Gfi1 deficient mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) is a zinc finger transcription factor with a SNAG amino-terminal repressor domain and is critically required for normal myelopoesis. Gfi1 is normally expressed in HSCs and induced during differentiation from CMPs to GMPs. Gfi1 loss-of-function mutation in mice and humans induces an arrest during myeloid differentiation and an absolute block to the formation mature neutrophils. This comparative microarray study was initiated to identify microRNAs which are potentially regulated by Gfi1 during granulopoiesis.
