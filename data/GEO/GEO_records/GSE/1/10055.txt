TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of 1M Regions in Medicago truncatula Using Tiling Microarrays

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We report here a transcriptonal analysis in six different organ types of a approximately 1 Mb region in legume plants barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) which is sytenic with soybean (Glycine max). We used oligonucleotide tiling microarrays to detecte transcription of over 80% of the predicted genes in both species. We detected differential gene expression in the six examined organ types. Keywords: RNA
