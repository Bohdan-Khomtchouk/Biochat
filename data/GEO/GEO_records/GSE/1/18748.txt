TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of MAPK KOs mutants under normal growing conditions (bb)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au07-10_mpk - bb - Gain insight into the function of mpk genes by characterizing the transcriptional profile of the mpk5, mpk10 and mpk11 KO mutants in comparison with that of the Arabidopsis wt plants. - Transcriptomic analysis of the double mutant bak1-4 bkk1-1 to compare its gene expression profile with that of the single mutants atmekk1 and atmpk4 and elucidate their involvement in the brassinolide signalling. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
1 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
