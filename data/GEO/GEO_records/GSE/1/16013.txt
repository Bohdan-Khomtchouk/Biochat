TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in staged Drosophila embryos, ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-seq data generated on Solexa Genome Analyzer for 6 Histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac), PolII and CBP/p300. Each factor has been studied for 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Keywords: Epigenetics For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
