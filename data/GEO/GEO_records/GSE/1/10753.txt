TITLE
A Snapshot of Copy Number Variation in the pig genome

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Recents studies in mammalian genomes have uncovered the extent of copy number variation (CNV) that contributes to phenotypic diversity, including health and disease status. Here we report the first glimpse of CNVs in the pig genome covering part of the chromosomes 4, 7, 14 and 17 already sequenced and assembled. We used a custom tiling oligonucleotide array with a median probe spacing of 409 bp to screen 12 unrelated Duroc boar founders of a vast-family material. After a strict CNV calling pipeline it was identified 40 copy number variable regions covering all the four chromosomes, with some overlapping segmental duplications and pig unigenes. This CNV snapshot analysis lays the groundwork for a better understanding of porcine phenotypes and genotypes for the identification of important economic traits.
