TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of Fat and Lean chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in the variation of the muscle glycogen content at death (estimated through the glycolytic potential, GP), a determining factor of meat quality in chicken. Gene expression profiles of Pectoralis major muscle were established using microarrays. We compared Fat and Lean chickens issued from two lines divergently selected for abdominal fatness and also differed for muscle GP. A total of 197 genes were differentially expressed between Fat and Lean pure chickens. Several of these genes were validated by qRT-PCR. For the genes with human orthologs, annotation analyses were performed and mainly revealed pathways involved carbohydrate, fatty-acid, and protein metabolism. The relationship between gene expression and meat quality has to now be validated by further e-QTL studies on the F2 population.
