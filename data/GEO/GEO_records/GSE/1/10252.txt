TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in MGAS315 and its isogenc mtsR mutant

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
RATIONALE: mtsR is a regulator of genes involved in ion aquisition in S. pyogenes that has been suggested to be involved in development of invasive infections. We wanted to identify mtsR regulon. EXPERIMENT: We compared global gene expression in wild type strain MGAS315 with expression in its isogenc mtsR mutant. Experiment was performed with bacteria in exponential (EXP) and at late exponential phase (Late EXP) grown in THY medium Keywords: strain comparison
