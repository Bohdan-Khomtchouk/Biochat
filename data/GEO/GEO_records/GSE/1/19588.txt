TITLE
Wdr5 mediates self-renewal and reprogramming via the embryonic stem cell core transcriptional network (2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The embryonic stem (ES) cell transcriptional and epigenetic networks are critical for the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal. It remains unclear whether interactions. Here we show that a core member of the Set/MLL complex, WDrepeat protein-5 (Wdr5), is a novel regulator of self-renewal and partners with Oct4 to maintain an intact transcriptional network and for efficient formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that Oct4 interacts with chromatin components and is indispensible for epigenetic regulation.  These findings suggest an integrated transcriptional and epigenetic model, mediated through Wdr5, for the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming. Differential gene expressions upon down-regulation of Wdr5 was analysed by comparing Wdr5R4 â€“dox (triplicate) and LucR +dox (duplicate) RNA samples Gene expression changes upon down-regulation of Oct4 was analysed by comparing Oct4 shRNA (duplicate) and GFP shRNA (duplicate) after 4day transfection

DESIGN
Wdr5: 5 samples are analyzed: Luciferase (Luc, 2 replicates) and Wdr5 with no dox (minusDox, 3 replicates) Oct4-GFP: 4 samples are analyzed: Oct4 shRNA (Oct4, 2 replicates) and GFP shRNA (GFP, 2 replicates)
