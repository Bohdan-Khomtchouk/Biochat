TITLE
Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba stage library

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
We identified 3418 genes transcribed at a level of at least two copies each. We identified many transcripts involved in protein translation, cell maintenance and metabolism, as expected for vegetative cells. The most highly expressed cell signaling genes include ubiquitin, smlA, and nucleotide exchange factors RasGEF F and Ras GEF G. Additionally, we identified many genes previously reported to be expressed only during later stages of development including dutA, actin8, thioredoxin3, culmination specific protein 45D, discoidin II and yelA.
