TITLE
Gene CNVs genetically mapped and linked to adaptation in spruce

ORGANISM
Picea glauca

SUMMARY
Following previous work, we extend the use of a reliable detection method to a wide progeny in white spruce in order to genetically map a maximum of inherited gene CNVs and linked those to phenotypic traits related to adaptation. We selected probes targeting 3911 genes likely in CNV in this progeny and performed genetic mapping for those harboring a 1:1 segregation. In addition, the link between gene CNVs and phenotypic variation was tested using budburst, budset and growth data for the same samples. Results: We genetically mapped 82 gene CNVs inherited from the previous generation and harboring the expected segregation ratio. This mapping allowed to delineate a few hotspots of CNV that are likely shared with other conifer species. In addition, individual-specific gene CNVs likely representing de novo variation supported the hypothesis of a purifying selection against copy losses. Finally, 29 gene CNVs were significantly associated to adaptive trait variation; 13 were located on the genetic map, including 4 located within hotspots of CNVs.

DESIGN
A total of 114 spruce descendants coming from a controlled cross were hybridized at the time with their 'mother' on a CGH array. In addition, the other parent was also compared to the 'mother'.
