TITLE
Clubroot catma-2: Deciphering the Arabidopsis mechanisms of resistance to clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra03-05_clubroot - clubroot catma-2 - Characterisation of the transcriptional changes (host genes up- and down-regulated) during the P. brassicae / A. thaliana interaction. - The objective was to identify the genes up and down-regulated between susceptible and partially resistant plants. The Arabidopsis accession Bur-0 shows partial resistance against the isolate eH of P. brassicae, whereas it is susceptible against the isolate e2. The transcriptome patterns of Bur-0 plants inoculated either by isolate e2 or isolate eH were compared at one week after inoculation. A similar comparison was done on roots. The entire experiment was repeated (biological repetition) and each comparison was performed in two independent hybridisations (technical repetition). Keywords: organ comparison
