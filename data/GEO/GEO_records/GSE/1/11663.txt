TITLE
Human cleavage stage embryos are chromosomally unstable

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embryonic chromosome aberrations cause birth defects and reduce human fertility. However, neither their nature nor incidence are known. Here, we develop a method to assess genome-wide copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity in single cells and apply it to screen blastomeres from in vitro fertilized preimplantation embryos. Complex patterns of chromosome-arm imbalances or segmental deletions, duplications or amplifications that were reciprocal in sister blastomeres were detected in a large proportion of the embryos. In addition, aneuploidies and uniparental isodisomies were frequently observed. Since these embryos were derived from young fertile couples, the data indicate that chromosomal instability is common to human embryogenesis. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation
