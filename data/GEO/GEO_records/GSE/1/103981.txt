TITLE
P68 protein inhibited the growth and invasion of glioma cells by adjusting the DUSP5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preliminary research shows that,The P68 protein was highly expressed in the glioma tissue specimen and was associated with the patient's survival.Inhibition of P68 protein expression in glioma cell lines inhibits the growth, invasion and appreciation of tumor cells.In this study, gene chip was used to search for new downstream genes DUSP5 that affect the growth of glioma.The expression of inhibition or overexpression of P68 protein in glioma cell lines was consistent with the expression of expression  DUSP5 and the effect of reduction DUSP5 on the growth of the tumor.The ability of the tumor to recover after the expression of DUSP5 expression in glioma cells was reduced,This indicates that P68 regulates the growth, increment and invasion of glioma cells.Through affymetrix  gene chip, we use 3 biological specimens.That is three SIP68 , control of the glioma cells that infect NC.Try to get P68 protein regulated downstream gene by knocking down P68 protein.

DESIGN
Two samples, 3 replicates/sample were analyzed using Gene Chip.
