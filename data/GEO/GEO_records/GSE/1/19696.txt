TITLE
Effect of Dietary Supplementation of Selenium (Organic vs. Inorganic) on Liver Gene Expression Profile in Beef Heifers

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Selenium (Se) is an essential nutrient for beef cattle health and commercial production. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the physiological responses of the animal to dietary Se supplementation, however, have not been evaluated. Furthermore, the potential effect of two chemical forms (organic vs. inorganic) of Se on gene expression by Se-sufficient cattle has not been evaluated. Microarray analysis using the GeneChip Bovine Genome Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was conducted to determine if dietary Se supplementation in organic vs. inorganic form (OSe vs. ISe) differentially affects the liver gene expression profile in growing beef heifers.

DESIGN
Sodium selenite (Prince Se Concentrate; Prince Agri Products, Inc., Quincy, IL) was used as the source of ISe form. Se-enriched yeast (Sel-Plex; Alltech, Inc., Nicholasville, KY) was used as the source of OSe form. Thirty Angus heifers (BW 393 Â± 9 kg) were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments (n = 10): Control (Ctrl) group received no dietary Se supplementation; ISe treatment group daily received dietary supplementation of Se at 3 mg/animal from ISe source; OSe treatment group daily received dietary supplementation of Se at 3 mg/animal from OSe source.  Six animals were randomly selected from each of 3 treatment groups for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
