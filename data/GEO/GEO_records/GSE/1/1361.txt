TITLE
Concurrent Versus Individual Binding of HuR and AUF1 to Common Labile Target mRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from material that had been immunoprecipitated (IP) from Hela cells using antibodies recognizing RNA-binding proteins HuR or AUF1, as well as using a control IgG1 antibody. RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of [alpha-33P]dCTP and the radiolabeled product used to hybridize human cDNA arrays. The experiment was repeated using three independent sample sets. The samples were numbered HuR-1, HuR-2, HuR-3, AUF1-1, AUF1-2, AUF1-3, IgG1-1, IgG1-2, IgG1-3. HuR represents RNA from IP reactions using an anti-HuR antibody, AUF1 represents RNA from IP reactions using an anti-AUF1 antibody and, IgG1 represents RNA from IP reactions using an anti-IgG1 antibody. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the three independent experimental datasets.
