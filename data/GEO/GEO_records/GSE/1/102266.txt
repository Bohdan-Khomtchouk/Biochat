TITLE
Stem cell-like properties of CK2β-downregulated mammary cells [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ubiquitous Protein kinase CK2 has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in a number of human tumors. This enzyme is composed of two catalytic α or α’ subunits and a dimer of β regulatory subunits whose expression levels are probably implicated in CK2 regulation. Several recent papers reported that unbalanced expression of CK2 subunits is sufficient to drive epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Herein, through transcriptomic and miRNA analysis together with comparison of cellular properties between wild type and CK2β-knock-down MCF10A cells, we show that down-regulation of CK2β subunit in mammary epithelial cells induces the acquisition of stem cell-like properties associated with CD44high/CD24low antigenic phenotype and the ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. These data demonstrate that a CK2β level establishes a critical cell fate threshold in the control of epithelial cell plasticity. Thus, this regulatory subunit functions as a nodal protein to maintain an epithelial phenotype.

DESIGN
The microarray analysis was performed with RNAs isolated from mock and ΔCK2β-derived MCF10A cells, each from two independent cell cultures (duplicates).
