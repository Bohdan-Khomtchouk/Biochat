TITLE
Regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression by synthetic drugs and exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exercise training increases endurance by inducing global gene expression changes in skeletal muscles.  The extent to which the genetic effects of exercise can be mimicked by synthetic drugs is unknown. We measured global skeletal muscle expression in sedentary and exercised mice treated with vehicle or PPARdelta ligand GW1516.  PPARdelta is a transcriptional regulator of muscle oxidative metabolism and fatigue resistance. Keywords: Pharmacology study
