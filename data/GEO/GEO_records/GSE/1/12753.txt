TITLE
Rex1/Zfp42 is dispensable for pluripotency in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We showed the function of Rex1 in mouse ES cells as well as in embryos using the conventional gene targeting strategy. Our results clearly indicated that Rex1 function is dispensable for both the maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells and the development of embryos. However, Rex1-/- ES cells showed the defect to induce a subset of the marker genes of visceral endoderm, when differentiated as embryoid body, as found in EC cells. Conclusion: Rex1 should be regarded just as a marker of pluripotency without functional significance like the activity of alkaline phosphatase.
