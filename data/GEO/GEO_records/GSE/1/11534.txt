Autoregulation of Th1-mediated inflammation by twist1 2nd part

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of repeatedly activated compared to recently activated Th1 cells to identify genes that play a role in chronic inflammatory disorders and may qualify as diagnostic or therapeutic targets; Upon activation under appropriate costimulatory conditions, naive T helper (Th) cells differentiate into Th2 or Th17 cells, each characterized by the expression of specific effector cytokines. In response to a repeated stimulation with antigen, Th cells develop a stable memory for the expression of those cytokines as well as for other secreted or membrane-associated factors. The stable memory for the expression of proinflammatory effector functions may explain the resistance of Th effector cells to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, and the inability of immunosuppression to cure chronic inflammation. The imprinting of the functional memory is based on epigenetic modifications and expression of distinct transcription factors. In this project, we compare the transcriptomes of once and repeatedly activated murine Th1 cells, to identify genes that induce and maintain the functional memory and control the persistence of pathogenic memory Th1 cells. This in turn might help to discriminate pathogenic versus protective cells in immunopathology and present novel targets for the diagnosis and therapy of chronic inflammatory disease.
