SUMMARY
The molecular processes underlying the properties of ESC are yet unknown even when it's well established that LIF/STAT3 is neccesary for the maintenance of pluripotency. Other pathways as Wnt are may be implicated in the regulation of the biological mechanisms in mESC. Work model: D3-ES cultivated with or without LIF and treated with chronic (7 days) low doses (50nM) of GSK3 Î² inhibitor (lithium). We used microarrays to detail the global profile of gene expression to identified different groups of up and down-regulated genes in the work model.
