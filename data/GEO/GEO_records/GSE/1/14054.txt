TITLE
Analysis of Ago2-associated transcripts after knockdown of Importin8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small regulatory RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) guide Argonaute (Ago) proteins to specific target RNAs leading to mRNA destabilization or translational repression. We recently reported the identification of Importin 8 (Imp8) as a novel component of miRNA-guided regulatory pathways. Imp8 interacts with Ago proteins and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), structures involved in RNA metabolism. For this micro-array dataset, we used immunoprecipitations of Ago2-associated mRNAs followed by micro-array analysis. The results demonstrate that Imp8 is required for recruiting Ago protein complexes to a large set of Ago2-associated target mRNAs allowing for efficient and specific gene silencing. Therefore, we provide evidence that Imp8 is required for cytoplasmic miRNA-guided gene silencing.
