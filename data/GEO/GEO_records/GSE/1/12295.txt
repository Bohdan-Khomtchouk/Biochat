TITLE
Class prediction models of thrombocytosis using genetic biomarkers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using custom spotted oligonucelotide platelet-focused arrays, platelet samples were compared. 48 health controls, 23 reactive thrombocytosis (RT) and 24 essential thrombocythemia (ET) samples were compared. An 11-biomarker gene subset was identified that discriminated among the three cohorts with 86.3% accuracy.
