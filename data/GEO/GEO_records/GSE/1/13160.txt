TITLE
In vivo endothelial transcriptomic responses to diesel engine exhaust are potentiated by hypercholesterolemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By means of Operon V3 microarrrays, the in vivo, aortic endothelial transcriptomic responses to chronic (30 day) whole body exposure to diesel exhaust were assessed in wild type and Apo E (-/-) mice.  The in vitro response of cultured Svec 4-10 cells exposed  to a soluble extract extract of diesel engine particulate were similarly assessed.
