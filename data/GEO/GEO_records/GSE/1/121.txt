Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Global transcript profiling to identify differentially expressed skeletal muscle genes in insulin resistance, a major risk factor for Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.  Compared gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle tissues from 18 insulin-sensitive versus 17 insulin-resistant equally obese, non-diabetic Pima Indians. Keywords: other
