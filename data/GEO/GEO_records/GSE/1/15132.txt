TITLE
Riboflavin depletion impairs cell proliferation in intestinal cells: Identification of mechanisms and consequences

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis has been applied to the cell proliferation in a human colonic cel line, Caco-2. We have shown previously that a moderate riboflavin depletion around weaning has a profound impact on the structure and function of the small intestine of the rat, which is not reversible following riboflavin repletion. In this study we have modelled riboflavin deficiency in a human cell line, shown irreversible loss of cell viability associated with impaired mitosis and identified candidate effectors of riboflavin depletion in the cell. The aim of the present study is to develop a cell culture model of riboflavin depletion and analyse its behaviour using a using a combination of cell biology approaches including microarray analysis.

DESIGN
A human colonic cell line, Caco-2, was grown in culture and treated to riboflavin depletion. Treated and untreated cells were collected at appropriate time points and isolated RNA subjected to microarray analysis.
