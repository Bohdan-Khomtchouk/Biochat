TITLE
Expression data from human colonic epithelial cells normal (N), adenoma (AD) or colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis of  laser microdissected human colonic epithelial cells can contribute to determination of disease-specific expression alterations in colonic epithelial cells and to localize the origin the expression changes measured in whole biopsy samples. Keywords: whole genomic expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from laser microdissected human colon epithelial cells and hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays
