TITLE
Characterization of the regulatory networks mediating TLR9 dependent gene activation in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CpG DNA interacts with TLR9 to stimulate a broadly protective innate immune response. This study uses bioinformatic network analysis of microarray data to identify the genes and regulatory networks triggered by CpG ODN. CpG treatment induced significant gene up-regulation (p < 0.00001) in the spleen within 30 min, peaking with the activation of > 500 genes at 3 hr, and declining progressively thereafter. There were reproducible changes in the pattern of gene expression over time. This was mediated by a small group of “major inducers” (IL1A, IL1B, TNF, IFNG) whose activity was modulated by several “minor inducers” (NFKB1, IL6, IL15, IL18, STAT1, STAT2). The subsequent decline in gene activation was mediated by “suppressors” (MYC, IL1RN, SOCS1, SOCS3, NFKBIA, IL10, FOS) that actively down-regulated gene expression and targeted both major and minor inducers. Thus, the regulation of TLR9 dependent gene activation involves multiple waves of stimulation mediated by a small number of “major” and “minor” inducers followed by the active inhibition of gene expression by “suppressors”.
