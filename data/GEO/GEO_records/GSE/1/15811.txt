TITLE
ZMYM2/FGFR1, BCR/FGFR1 or BCR/ABL1 in human cord blood CD34+ cells reveals similar but distinct gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS), also referred to as the stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome, is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that rapidly progresses into an acute leukemia. Molecularly, EMS is characterized by fusion of various partner genes to the FGFR1 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity within FGFR1. The two most common fusion genes in human EMS are ZMYM2/FGFR1 (previously known as ZNF198/FGFR1) and BCR/FGFR1. To study the transcriptional programs becoming deregulated by the FGFR1 fusion genes, global gene expression analysis on human CD34+ cord blood cells expressing either of the fusion oncogenes ZMYM2/FGFR1 and BCR/FGFR1 was performed. As a reference gene we also included the more studied BCR/ABL1 fusion oncogene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. We found that the 3 different fusion oncogenes had in common the upregulation of several genes involved in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and also other sets of genes. However, the gene expression profiles were not identical, suggesting that both the tyrosine kinase containing gene and the partner gene would affect the transcription of downstream target genes.

DESIGN
Bicistronic retroviral murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vectors expressing ZMYM2/FGFR1, BCR/FGFR1or P210 BCR/ABL1 and GFP were used. The MIG control vector expressed GFP only. Two days post transfection of human CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells, GFP-sorted cells were collected in three biological replicates and RNA was isolated immediately. RNA extraction and data analysis were performed as described (Ã…gerstam et al., submitted). In total, 12 samples were hybridized and scanned.
