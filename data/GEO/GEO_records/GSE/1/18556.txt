TITLE
A gene-expression oligo microarray for the three developmental stages of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis

ORGANISM
Ichthyophthirius multifiliis

SUMMARY
The protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) is a eukaryotic ciliate parasite of freshwater fish.  Ich causes ichthyophthiriosis or ‘white spot disease’ characterized by white cysts covering the host skin and gills. The parasite is responsible for high mortalities and severe economic losses to farmed species as well as to ornamental species of fish.  Despite the global importance of Ich, little is known about the genetic processes underlying its development and infectivity. Ich has three main life-stages, an infective theront, a parasitic trophont, and a reproductive tomont.  To compare gene expression among Ich life-stages, oligonucleotide microarrays were constructed and utilized.  All publicly-available Ich ESTs (~35K) were clustered to generate 9,129 unique consensus sequences represented as probes on custom microarrays produced in coordination with Roche NimbleGen.   To facilitate comparative genomic analysis and to potentially increase gene content through cross-hybridization, gene coding sequences of related protozoans Tetrahymena thermophila and Plasmodium falciparum were also added to the microarrays.  Gene expression was analyzed in samples taken from each of the three Ich life-stages.  The results of this study will add in the understanding of protozoan global gene regulation and biology and should aid in the development of strategies aimed at the control of this important fish parasite.
