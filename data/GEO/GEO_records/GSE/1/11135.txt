TITLE
The MILE (Microarray Innovations In LEukemia) study pre-phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An international standardization program towards the application of gene expression profiling in routine leukaemia diagnostics: The MILE study pre-phase. A total of 11 laboratories from three continents performed 204 analyses using a whole-genome expression microarray. In an effort to standardize the microarray procedure, each participating centre was equipped with identical hardware, software, and reagents. Designated study operators received intensive individual training on the sample preparation protocol. Keywords: Standardization and reproducibility of microarray analysis
