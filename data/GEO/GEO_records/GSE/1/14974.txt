TITLE
HTCC1062 glucose versus no carbon log phase

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1002

SUMMARY
The primary goal of this experiment is to examine the transcription profiles of HTCC1062 when grown in the presence or absence of D-glucose (30uM final concentration). Experiment confirmed activity of predicted glycolysis operon.
