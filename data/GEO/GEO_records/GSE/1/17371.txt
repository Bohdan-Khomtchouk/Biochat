TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in Skeletal Muscle from Obese, Diet-Sensitive and Diet-Resistant Women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle (rectus femoris) gene expression was analyzed from diet-resistant and diet-sensitive obese women undergoing clinically supervised weight-loss at a weight management clinic The goal of the study was to characterize global gene expression profiles in skeletal muscle from obese women, prior to their participation in a clinically supervised, low-calorie diet, weight management program. Following entry into the weight-loss program, subjects can be categorized as being 'diet-sensitive' or 'diet-resistant' depending on the rates of weight loss achieved. In the current study, we selected an equal number of diet-sensitive and diet-resistant subjects for comparative expression profiling

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle samples were analyzed from diet-sensitive and diet-resistant women, for a total of 12 samples. There were no replicates.
