TITLE
HeLa cells treated with V-ATPase inhibitors or with desoxyferramine compared to HeLa in DMSO or medium with low LDL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from HeLa cells treated with V-ATPase inhibitors or with desoxyferramine compared to HeLa treated with DMSO or medium with low LDL To determine which genes respond first to low concentrations of V-ATPase inhibition, we treated HeLa cells with two different V-ATPase inhibitors, bafilomycin and phenylsalicylihalamide (LX1077) at concentrations that slow cell growth by only 20%. To identify genes responding to expected effects of inhibiting the V-ATPase, expression data from inhibiting the V-ATPase was compared to that of chelating iron or incubating cells in medium with low LDL.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in HeLa cells at 6, 12 & 24 hours culture in the presence of V-ATPase inhibitors.  For each drug treatment, control cells were incubated at the same time with the same concentration of DMSO used as carrier for the drugs. HeLa cells were also treated with the iron chelator, desoxiferamine for 6 or 12 hours or with medium with low LDL for 12 hours to identify genes that respond to low iron or low cholesterol. Each timepoint and each treatment has two independent replicates. Experimental samples were compared to control samples grown on the same day.
