TITLE
Leishmania major promastigote ChIP-chip: TBP, SNAP50, acetylH3

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify likely sites of polycistronic transcription initiation in a kinetoplastid parasite.  Peaks in histone H3 acetylations were found to mark these likely sites, with TBP and SNAP50 enriched upstream of these acetylation peaks.  Acetylation peaks are greater in rapidly dividing cells than in stationary cells.
