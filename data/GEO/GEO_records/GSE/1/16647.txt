TITLE
Gene expression profiling of NCAM-deficient mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of mice lacking the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM (Ncam-/-) in comparison to wild-type mice of same age and genetic background (Ncam+/+). NCAM-deficient mice exhibit deficits in long-term potentiation and spatial learning, as well as increased intermale aggression. We performed a microarray analysis of adult NCAM-deficient mouse brains to identify molecular targets which might underly the phenotype of NCAM-deficient mice.

DESIGN
We analyzed the gene expression profiles in 2-3 months old (young adult) mouse brains, with both the Ncam-/- and the Ncam+/+ group consisting of three individuals each. Wild-type and NCAM-deficient animals had the same genetic background. RNA was prepared from total brain.
