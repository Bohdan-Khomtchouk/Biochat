TITLE
Expression data from porcine endometrial epithelial cells induced by seminal exosomes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Purpose: Seminal fluid (SF) is considered as a regulator on environment establishing in female reproductive tract of various mammal species without mechanism elucidated completely. This study aimed to identified the function of exosome isolated from SF on porcine endometrium. Methods: Total RNA profiles of porcine endometrial epithelial cells with seminal exosomes treatment (EXO.) or not (CTRL.) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using HiSeq 2500. Trimmed sequences were analyzed on the basis of the TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline based on the porcine genome and reference annotations obtained from Ensembl genome browser ( ). Results: 10916 transcripts, from which 70 genes were up-regulated and 114 genes were down-regulated with q-values less than 0.05 in EECs with seminal exosome treatment compared to those without exosome treatment. Conclusions: Through the gene ontology (GO) biological process and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis which revealed significantly enriched or decreased molecular functions, Our work demonstrated that exosomes derived from porcine seminal fluid  induced endometrial immune and inflammatory response via CCL20 and AMCFII regulation specifically, which may facilitate sperm cells survival and activation, and resulting in appropriate environment required for fertilization and even implantation.
