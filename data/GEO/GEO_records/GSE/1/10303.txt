TITLE
Differential Gene Expression Associated With Postnatal Articular Cartilage Maturation

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Chondrocyte gene expression was analyzed to study mechanisms involved in the structural and functional adaptation of articular cartilage during postnatal maturation.  Transcriptional profiling was used to compare articular chondrocytes between four neonatal and four adult horses.  Expressional differences featured matrix proteins and matrix-modifying enzymes reflecting the transition from cartilage growth to cartilage homeostasis. Keywords: articular cartilage, maturation, horse, cDNA microarray
