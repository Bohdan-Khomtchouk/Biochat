TITLE
Expression data from Non small cell lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non small cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in the western world. RNA expression profiles have been demonstrated to be associated with a specific clinical course of the disease. We used microarray analysis to capture the whole transcriptome of a series of lung cancer cell lines to extract RNA profiles associated with specific genomic lesions Keywords: steady state

DESIGN
Lung cancer cell lines were exponentially grown and harvested during this phase of exponential growth
