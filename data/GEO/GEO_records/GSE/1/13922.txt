TITLE
The effects of Mycophenolate treatment on the transcriptomes of patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was conducted in order to assess the effects of the compound Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydroxygenase (IMPDH) with a strong cytostatic effect on T-cells, on the phenotype of human carotid artery stenosis in humans in vivo. This was done at the transcriptome level by comparing the gene expression profiles of carotid endarterectomy samples from patients with carotid artery stenosis ( > 70% diameter stenosis on angiography) that were randomly assigned to treatment with MMF 1000 mg (N=9) or Placebo (N=11), respectively. MMF or placebo was given for at least 2 weeks prior to undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
