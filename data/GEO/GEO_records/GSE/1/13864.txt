TITLE
Effect of conditional deletion of S6 ribosomal protein following partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of the RPS6 gene in mouse liver results in the inhibition of 40S ribosome biogenesis and the failure of hepatocytes to enter S-phase following partial hepatectomy. This microarray experiment was designed to assess the effects of RPS6 deletion on the expression of genes involved in liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Keywords: time course, liver
