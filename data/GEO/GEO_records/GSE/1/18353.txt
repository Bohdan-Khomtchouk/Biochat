affy_duplicature_lyon_rose. Double flower phenomenon: Control of petal number in roses

ORGANISM
Rosa

SUMMARY
affy_duplicature_lyon_rose. The objective is to identify the genes involved in petal doubling in rose. In this study we are using two rosa gallica genotypes: wild-type (simple flower rose) and Cardinal de Richelieu (double flower rose), and two rosa hybrida genotypes : Souvenir de la Malmaison, which has about 110 petal, and its bud sport cultivar, Souvenir de St Anneâ€™s. In this study, we used a microarray approach to compare the transcriptome of double flower rose (CDR) versus simple flower rose (G). The objective is to identify genes whose expression is associated with the double flower phenotype. These genes are putative candidates involved in the control of petal organ number per flower. Floral buds were dissected under a microscope and pooled in eppendorf tubes. Tissue samples were harvested at the same time during 3 weeks in April 2007. Total RNA was extracted from the pools of flowers using the Plant RNA kit (Macherey Nagel), and then used to hybridize Rosa-Affymetrix microarrays. Keywords: genotype comparison
