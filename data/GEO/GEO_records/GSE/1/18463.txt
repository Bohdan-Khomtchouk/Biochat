TITLE
The effects of Hmgb1 depletion on gene expression in murine cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved non-histone chromatin component with the ability to bind and bend DNA. The protein is involved in fundamental nuclear processes including nucleosome sliding, transcription, replication, V(D)J recombination and DNA transposition. To assess the functional impact of HMGB1 on transcription we performed gene expression profile analyses of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type or knockout for the Hmgb1 gene
