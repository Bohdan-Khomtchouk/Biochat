TITLE
mRNA expression data from overexpression or inhibition of miR-340 in 451 Lu melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterizing miRNA function remains challenging due to an abundance of predicted targets and an experimental bottleneck in identifying biologically relevant direct targets. We developed a novel technique (miFAST) to identify direct miRNA target genes. Using miFAST, we confirmed several previously reported miR-340 target genes and identified five additional novel direct miR-340 targets in melanoma cells. This methodology can also be efficiently applied for the global characterization of miRNA targets.

DESIGN
miR-340 inhibited or overexpressed 451 Lu melanoma cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization onto Affymetrix microarrays.
