TITLE
Genes regulated by AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines FA6 and MiaPaCa2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have shown that AGR2 is frequently upregulated during the development of pancreatic cancer. We used microarray to look at the target genes regulated by AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines FA6 and MiaPaCa2. Keywords: gene knock-down, overexpression
