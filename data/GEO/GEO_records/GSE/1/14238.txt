TITLE
Expression data from E. coli O157:H7 growth in the absence or presence of HEp-2 epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli O157:H7 global gene expression profile is altered during growth in the presence of Hep-2 cells, relative to the absence of cells We used Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 genechips to determine gene expression changes
