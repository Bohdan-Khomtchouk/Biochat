TITLE
Mucosal Glycan Foraging Enhances the Fitness and Transmission of a Saccharolytic Human Distal Gut Symbiont: ECF mutant

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Growth of isogenic parent ('tdk strain'), 5xECF-sigma factor mutant and complemented mutant strain in the cecum of NMRI inbred mice fed a glycan-restricted, 'simple sugar' diet (35% each glucose and sucrose). Bacteria were collected from mouse distal gut 10 days after colonization.
