TITLE
Expression data for UV time course in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type and mutant strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents leads to large-scale gene expression changes. Proper transcriptional regulation is important for cells to arrest, repair damage and adjust cellular processes such as metabolism in order to survive the damaging assault. Damage-induced transcription is a highly regulated response. This study establishes a novel role for two factors, Snf1 and Rad23, in regulation of the UV-induced transcriptional response.
