TITLE
Expression data from Human seminal vesicles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human seminal plasma is a potential source of biomarkers for male reproductive disorders. A tissue-profiling analysis of the main organs participating in the secretion of this body fluid was conducted to identify tissue-specific genes along the male reproductive tract.

DESIGN
Total RNA from non pathological Human seminal vesicles were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Expression signals in seminal vesicles (present dataset), prostates (GEO; GSE7307), epidydimises (GEO; GSE7808) and testicular samples (Arrayexpress; E-TABM-130) were compared to identify genes that are detected in one of these organs only.
