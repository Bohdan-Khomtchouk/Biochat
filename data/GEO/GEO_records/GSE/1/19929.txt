TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Folsomia candida exposed to polar and apolar narcotizing compounds.

ORGANISM
Folsomia candida

SUMMARY
Narcosis or baseline toxicity is the inert toxicity of hydrophobic compounds, supposed to take place at the level of the cellular membranes. Based on the linear relationship between the  toxicity (logEC50) and the hydrophobicity (logKow), class I and II narcotizing compounds are  recognized, in which the latter group is assumed to exert additional toxic mechanisms by  hydrogen bond donor acidity by their polar groups. Chlorinated anilines, which occur  often in the environment as degradation products of certain pesticides , are considered to be  narcotizing compounds. In this study the transcriptional responses of the soil arthropod Folsomia candida are investigated upon exposure to a series of anilines with increasing chlorination. A discrimination between class1 and class2 narcotizing compound is being made.

DESIGN
Twenty-three day old Folsomia candida were exposed in LUFA 2.2 standard soil for two days to the EC50 concentrations of the following compounds: aniline, 4-chloroaniline, 3.5-dichloroaniline, 2,3,4-trichloroaniline, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroaniline, pentachloroaniline and 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene.1,2,3,4-tetrachlrobenzene was included in the experimental design as a posiitive control of a narcotic class 1 compound. Four biological replicates were used for every treatment and a dye swap was used with the Cy3/Cy5 labels. This resulted in 32 samples which were analysed in 16 hybridisations executed in an interwoven loop design. The solvent (for spiking the soil) control was used as the reference treatment in the data analysis.
