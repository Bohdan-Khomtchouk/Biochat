TITLE
Genome-wide direct targets of PIL5 (ChIP-chip analysis of PIL5)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PIL5 is a key negative regulator of phytochrome mediated seed germination and PIL5 protein is degraded by red light irradiation through phytochrome. The ChIP-chip analysis aimed to find various PIL5 direct targets in the Arabidopsis genome.
