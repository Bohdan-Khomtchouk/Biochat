TITLE
Expression data from human PBMC samples exposed to IL-12 and paired controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) is known to play a central role in adaptive and innate immunity. We employed microarray analysis of IL-12 induced gene expression to provide further insights into its effects on immune response. Keywords: Paired study of expression levels: Treated vs. Control
