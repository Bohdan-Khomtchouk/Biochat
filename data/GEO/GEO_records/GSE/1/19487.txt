Lungs of mice exposed to subtoxic doses of nano-titanium dioxide particles by inhalation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acute phase reactants serum amyloid A-1, 3 and micro RNA-135b, -449a, and -1 are induced in lungs of mice exposed to subtoxic doses of nano-titanium dioxide particles by inhalation In the present study we investigate pulmonary mRNA and miRNA profiles of mice exposed to subtoxic dose of nano-titanium dioxide particles by inhalation. We show dramatic induction of acute phase reactants, chemoattractants, immune and host defence related genes. We also demonstrate for the first time changes in miRNA profiles in the lungs in response to nanoTiO2. Keywords: Toxicology, disease state analysis, biomarkers of health effects
