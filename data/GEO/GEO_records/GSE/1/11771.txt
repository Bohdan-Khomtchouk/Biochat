TITLE
Bortezomib resistance in THP-1 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used in severel different hematological malignancies. Resistance to this drug is still poorly understood. In order get more insight in the resistance mechanism, we developed several bortezomib resistant subclones of the THP-1 monocytic/macrophage cell line. On these subclones expression arrays were performed.
