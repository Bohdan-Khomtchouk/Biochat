TITLE
Differences between CD44+/CD24- and CD44-/CD24+ subpopulation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD44+/CD24- subpopulation of normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells are suggested to have stem cell properties. The goal of this study was to identify gene expression differences between CD44+/CD24- and CD44-/CD24+ subpopulation of cells from a same cell lines. We selected MCF-10A cells, which are immortalized derived from a fibrocystic breast disease. These cells are immortalized but not transformed and express basal cell markers. Cells were from a single sort but plated into four 100 mm plates. RNA was prepared from each plate separately for the analysis.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression between 2 groups ( CD44+/CD24- and CD44-/CD24+) 4 replicates each.
