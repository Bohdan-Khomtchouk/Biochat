TITLE
Oogenesis in Solea senegalensis: Previtellogenic versus vitellogenic ovaries

ORGANISM
Solea senegalensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptionnal profile changes in ovary during the reproductive cycle of Solea senegalensis: from previtellogenic stage to vitellogenic stage obtained at different times during the annual reproductive cycle. An oligo microarray based on ESTs sequenced from S. senegalensis previously designed (Cerd√† et al., 2008, BMC genomics) was used.

DESIGN
The two stages of ovary development were directly compared using three individuals for each stage (IR-Pv-1, IR-Pv-2, IR-Pv-3 for previtellogenic individuals and IR-Vt-1, IR-Vt-2, IR-Vt-3 for vitellogenic individuals). For the experiment, the vitellogenic stage was used as the control.
