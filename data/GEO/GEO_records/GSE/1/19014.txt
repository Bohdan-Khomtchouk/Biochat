TITLE
Pyruvate carboxylase and carbon metabolism in Listeria monocytogenes

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of wild type L. monocytogenes (EGDe) and a pycA mutant strain was compared on growth in BHI. The human pathogen L. monocytogenes is a facultatively intracellular bacterium that  survives and replicates in the cytosol of many mammalian cells. The listerial  metabolism, especially under intracellular conditions , is still poorly understood. Recent  studies analyzed the carbon metabolism of L. monocytogenes by the 13C-isotopologue  perturbation method in a defined minimal medium containing [U-13C6]glucose. It was  shown that these bacteria produce oxaloacetate mainly by carboxylation of pyruvate due  to an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here we report that a pycA insertion mutant  defective in pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) still grows, albeit at a reduced rate, in BHI  medium, but is unable to multiply in a defined minimal medium with glucose or glycerol 36 as carbon source. Transcriptional profiling was performed on the pycA mutant and the wild type strain grown in BHI to get a closer insight into the effect of the pycA mutation in Listeria monocytogenes.

DESIGN
RNA from the two strains were isolated after growth in BHI and and compared using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays
