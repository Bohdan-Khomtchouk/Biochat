Expression data from in vitro-induced non-hypoxic tumour associated macrophages (TAMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Active immunotherapy is a promising strategy for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. Recently, we have reported that a vaccine using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced specific anti-endothelial immune responses in the most of immunized patients, and resulted in tumor regression in some patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors, whereas not in colorectal cancer patients. In this study, we hypothesized that non-hypoxic perivascular tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in colorectal cancer, but not in glioblastoma, might negatively alter the therapeutic efficacy of anti-angiogenic active immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we examined global gene expression profiles of non-hypoxic macrophages stimulated in vitro by soluble factors released from tumor cells of human glioblastoma U-87MG (‘brain TAMs’) or colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 (‘colon TAMs’).

DESIGN
Murine non-hypoxic TAMs were induced in vitro by incubation with soluble factors released from human cancer cell lines U-87MG ('brain TAMs') or HT-29 ('colon TAMs'), for RNA extraction and subsequent hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To evaluate homogeneous macrophage populations at different tumour developmental stages, RNA aliquots of control macrophages and TAMs obtained at five different time-points, i.e. 8h, 16h, 24h, 32h and 40h, were pooled and used for screening of differentially expressed genes. The experiments for TAMs as well as for control unstimulated macrophages were performed in triplicates.
