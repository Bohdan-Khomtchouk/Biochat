Expression data from human primary fibroblasts, endothelial and smooth muscle cells infected with Trypanosoma cruzi

SUMMARY
Trypanosoma cruzi is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that causes human Chagasâ€™ disease, a leading cause of heart failure in Latin America. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays we screened phenotypically diverse human cells  (foreskin fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells) for a common transcriptional response signature to T. cruzi. A common feature was a prominent type I interferon response, indicative of a secondary response to secreted cytokines. Using transwell plates to distinguish cytokine-dependent and -independent gene expression profiles in T. cruzi-infected cells, a core cytokine-independent response was identified in fibroblasts and endothelial cells that featured metabolic and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, amino acid catabolism and response to wounding. Significant downregulation of genes involved in mitotic cell cycle and cell division predicted that T. cruzi infection impedes cell cycle progression in the host cell.
