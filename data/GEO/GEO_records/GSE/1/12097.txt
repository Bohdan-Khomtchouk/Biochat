TITLE
antiOsLIC collar chip

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
30 collars were taken from wild type plants or antiOsLIC transgenic plants respectively. One collar from one plant only. The leaves are just sprout 2-3 cm (about 1-2 days) from the stem. For measuring the genes expression level, Wild type plants were taken as control. The developing collar from both line2 of OsLIC antisense transgenic plants and wild type were harvested at the heading stage. The position of the collar was about 1cm above the last developed collar. Total RNA was extracted from the collars using TRIzol regeant (Invitrogen, P/N 15596-018, USA) and purified by using Qiagen RNeasy columns (QIAGEN, Cat. NO. 74104). All the processes for cDNA and cRNA synthesis, cRNA fragmentation, hybridization, washing and staining, and scanning, were conducted according to the GeneChip Standard Protocol (Eukaryotic Target Preparation, Affymetrix). Poly-A RNA Control Kit and the One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis kit were used in this experiment as described in the website:
