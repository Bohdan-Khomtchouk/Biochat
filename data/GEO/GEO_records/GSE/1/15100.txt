TITLE
Gene expression in Phytophthora sojae mycelia, germinating zoospores, and during infection of soybean hypocotyls

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Total RNA extracted from Phytophthora sojae (strain P6497) and infected soybean hypocotyls (cultivar Harosoy) provided template for synthesis of cDNA probes used in the microarray hybridizations. Infected plant hypocotyls were sampled 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after inoculation. Mycelia were grown on synthetic media (H & S) or vegetable juice media (V8). Zoospores were sampled at 0 h, 2 h and 6 h after inducing encystment and germination by agitation. We used microarrays to characterize gene expression patterns in the root rot pathogen Phytophthora sojae and its host Glycine max. Keywords: infection time course, zoospore germination time course, media formulation response
