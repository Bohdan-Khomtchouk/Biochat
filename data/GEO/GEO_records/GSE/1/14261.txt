TITLE
Dexamethasone-resistant multiple myeloma cell line OPM1 treated with Dexamethasone and/or DAC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes responsible for the synergistic effect of DAC with Dex, we performed cDNA microarray analyses using cDNA prepared from Dex-resistant OPM1 cells treated with/without Dex, DAC or DAC+Dex.
