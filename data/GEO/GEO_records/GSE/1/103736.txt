TITLE
Transcriptional profile of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white vastus lateralis (WV) from BATI4KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-seq data from the brown fat and vastus muscles of mice lacking IRF4 in brown fat (BATI4KO) vs floxed littermate controls

DESIGN
Whole tissue (BAT and white vastus) was harvested from BATI4KO mice or floxed littermate controls
