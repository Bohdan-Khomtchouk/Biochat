TITLE
Lung Trafficking of Macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trafficking of monocytes into lung tissue and their differentiation into lung resident macrophages and dendritic cells is supposed to be regulated by the expression of specific gene clusters, which promote cell-cell interaction, migration and matrix degradation and the acquisition of tissue specific cellular phenotypes. Traffic related gene clusters include chemokines, integrins, and tissue-degrading matrix metallopeptidases, for all of which members have been shown to be functionally important. A complete picture, however, of the gene clusters that are regulated during in vivo migration and differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes under non-inflammatory conditions has not been obtained yet. Currently, adaptive changes of cellular phenotypes cannot be directly assessed by cell fate mapping during the slow trafficking of mononuclear phagocytes to lung tissue under steady-state conditions. Therefore, as an alternative approach to gain a better insight into the genetic programs that drive the mononuclear phagocyte migration and differentiation processes, the transcriptomes of circulating monocytes were compared with their lung tissue mononuclear phagocyte progeny.
