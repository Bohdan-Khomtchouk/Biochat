TITLE
Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array expression profiling of 41 human breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis under normal culture conditions (RPMI-10%FBS) and at optimal cell densities.

DESIGN
We have analysed 41 samples, of which OCUB-F and OCUB-M are from same tumor. Tha data were processed by analysing the expression of core level exons and transcript assignments are based upon hg18 genome build up.
