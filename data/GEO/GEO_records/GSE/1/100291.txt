TITLE
FOXP2's impact on the primate transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription repressor FOXP2 is a crucial player in nervous system evolution and development of humans and songbirds. In spite of its relevance, the FOXP2-controlled network and its functional implications are only partially understood. Therefore, we analyzed the transcriptomes of human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) stably overexpressing human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset FOXP2 cDNAs. Clones carrying empty vector served as a standard of baseline expression. All conditions were represented by two biological replicates (A, B), each. By comparing expression levels (bases which map per kb of exon model per million mapped bases) across the different conditions we were able to identify genes with differential expression in clones overexpressing human FOXP2 relative to each other condition.

DESIGN
Examination of expression profiles in SH-SY5Y clones that were alternatively transfected with different primate FOXP2 cDNAs
