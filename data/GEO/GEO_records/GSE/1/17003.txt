TITLE
Gene expression analysis of HEK293T cells after CHMP5 gene modulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in HEK293T cells after CHMP5 gene modulation.

DESIGN
In this study,  HEK293T cells, silenced  for CHMP5 using sh-CHMP5  was compared to genome wide expression changes when compared to cellular transfections with a  sh-luciferase control by Significance Analysis of Microarray data. Further, overexpression of CHMP5 using the vector pCMV_CHMP5 was compared to cellular transfections with an empty vector pCMV in the cell line HEK293T
