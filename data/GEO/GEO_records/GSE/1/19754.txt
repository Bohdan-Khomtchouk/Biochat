TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish mononuclear myogenic cells (zMNCs) during myogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of zebrafish mononuclear myogenic cells (zMNCs) during myogenic differentiation. The main goal is to identify the similarities of zMNC myogenic differentiation with that of mammalian myoblast differentiation. Critical time points were used to identify a switch from the activity of cell proliferation genes to myogenic structural genes.

DESIGN
15-20 adult zebrafish dorsal skeletal muscles were isolated at each of 6 distinct time points (day 0, day 1, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14) in replicates.
