TITLE
Repeatability and comparability of microRNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared repeatability and comparability of microRNA microarray using 5 different platforms. and compared microarray data generated from five different microRNA microarray platforms with quantitative RT-PCR. Our data suggested that the most accurate and repeatable methods for microRNA expression profiling are Agilent and Toray, and the numbers of detected microRNA at Toray are more than at Agilent. Keywords: repeatability, comparability, microRNA, microarray
