TITLE
Whole genome sequening of Drosophila melanogaster from different microclimates at 'Evolution Canyon'

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced the genomes of 32 isofemale fly lines from two divergent microclimates at 'Evolution Canyon' in Israel (16 fly lines from each microclimate).

DESIGN
We sequenced the whole genomes of single male flies from each of the 32 isofemale fly lines from 'Evolution Canyon'.
