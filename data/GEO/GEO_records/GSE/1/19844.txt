affy_xoo_rice-Transcriptomics-based identification of Xoo strain BAI3 Talc targets in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
affy_xoo_rice - affy_xoo_rice - The Bacterial Leaf Blight disease of rice is due to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. As for many pathogenic bacteria, it relies on a type 3 secretion system that is devoted to the injection of type 3 effectors into the eukaryotic host cell. These proteins are meant to suppress host basal defense responses and/or mimic some host regulatory function promoting bacterial survey in the plant. We are interested in the functional analysis of a subgroup of Xoo T3Es, that are specialized in host cell transcriptome remodelling. These effectors, therefore called TAL for Transcription Activator-Like proteins (also named AvrBs3/PthA-like), are often key virulence factors essential to Xoo pathogenicity such as the effector protein Talc of african Xoo strain BAI3. Our goal is to understand its function during disease development, by identifying rice host genes that are being directly up- or down-regulated by Talc. To that end, we aim at performing Affymetrix transcriptomic analysis, comparing leaf samples of a susceptible rice line inoculated with Xoo to leaves challenged with a Talc-deficient mutant and water-treated leaves. Highly induced genes are likely to be Talc primary targets and therefore potentially good susceptibility gene candidates.-The goal of the experiment is to identify the rice genes up- or down-regulated by the type III effector Talc from Xoo African strain BAI3, upon the inoculation of susceptible rice leaves 24 hours post-infection. To that end, the experimental design includes the inoculation of Nipponbare rice leaves with the virulent Xoo strain BAI3, that will be compared to Nipponbare rice leaves inoculated with a talc K.O. mutant strain and water.
