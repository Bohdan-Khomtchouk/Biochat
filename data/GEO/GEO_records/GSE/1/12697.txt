TITLE
Trap-80-dependence of TNF-alpha-induced genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In fibroblasts, p65-dependent genes can be sub-divided, depending on whether they are Trap-80-dependent or -independent.  To examine the generality of this grouping, we performed a microarray analysis of wild-type and Trap-80 knock-down fibroblasts, before and after stimulation of NF-kappaB activity using TNF-alpha.
