Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression patterns between weight control and regaining weight subjects

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: This work aimed at identifying and characterizing differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression patterns between subjects succeeding weight control against subjects regaining weight 6 months after a low calorie diet program. Methods: Weight-reduced obese subjects from 8 European countries were randomized into 4 diets differing in protein and glycemic index. In addition to the anthropometric and plasma parameters, SAT biopsies were taken at the beginning (CID2) and the end (CID3) of the weight maintenance intervention. Pan-genomic cDNA microarrays were used to define SAT gene expression profiles at both CID2 and CID3 of 22 subjects succeeding weight maintenance (successful subjects; mean weight change= -2.6 ± 1.2 kg) and 22 subjects regaining weight (unsuccessful subjects; mean weight change= 3.9 ± 1.3 kg) among the 4 dietary arms. Results: Differences in SAT gene expression patterns between successful and unsuccessful groups were mainly due to weight variations rather to differences in diet macronutrient composition. An ANCOVA analysis with total energy intake at CID3 as covariant led us to the definition of 1339 differential genes. Functional analysis of differential genes showed that cellular growth and proliferation, inflammation, cell death, cancer, cellular function and maintenance were the main biological processes involving these differential genes.
