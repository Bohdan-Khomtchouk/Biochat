TITLE
Response of Rhodopirellula baltica to heat shock

ORGANISM
Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the stress response of the marine Planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica after a temperature up-shift. R. baltica cultures were grown at 28°C and then shifted to 37°C. Samples were taken after 10, 20, 40, 60 and 300min and compared with cultures before the up-shift (28°C). Time series experiment, whole genome array
