TITLE
Thyroid Hormone (TH) Controls The Remodeling Of The Pancreas And The Liver, Part B

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Thyroid hormone (TH) controls the remodeling of the pancreas and the liver.  TH-induces dedifferentiation of the exocrine pancreas to a progenitor state (Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. 105, 8962-8967 (2008)) and it remodels the endocrine pancreas (Dev. Biol. 328, 384-391 (2009)). The redifferentiated frog pancreas resembles closely the pancreas of other typical vertebrates. Two pancreas arrays were carried out. The first one studied gene expression changes at different developmental stages of Xenopus laevis during metamorphosis. The second array studies gene expression changes at varying times after the addition of TH to premetamorphic tadpoles. Keywords: co-expression design,development or differentiation design,reference design,time series design

DESIGN
Overall design: Thyroid hormone (TH) controls remodeling of the liver. The microarray was carried out to identify changes in gene expression at different stages of development during metamorphosis.  This is part 2, done on the 22K Xenopus platform version 1. This dataset was from livers of Xenopus tadpoles (NF52, NF62, and NF66). Each was made in triplicate. Samples in all 3 parts of the study received the same thyroid hormone levels.
