TITLE
LEAFY-GR time-course experiment in callus

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Callus derived from 35S:LFY-GR plants was treated with dexamethasone- or was mock-treated for 0,2,4,6,8,10,12, or 22 hours. Four biologically independent sets of samples were generated and RNA probes derived from these samples were co-hybridized to a cDNA array enriched for flower-specific transcripts. The data were analyzed with Rosetta Resolver as described in Wagner et al. (2004). Keywords: time-course
