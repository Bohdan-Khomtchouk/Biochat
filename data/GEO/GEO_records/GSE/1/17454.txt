TITLE
Identification of transcription factor CEH-14 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for CEH-14 at L2 stage, which is required for specification of the AFD thermosensory neurons and for normal thermotactic behavior.
