TITLE
Global transcriptional activity in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency and lineage specification from embryonic (ES) cells are largely unclear. Differentiation pathways may be determined by the targeted activation of lineage specific genes or by selective silencing of genome regions during differentiation. Here we show that large fractions of the ES cell genome are transcriptionally active and undergo global silencing as cells differentiate. Normally silent repeat regions are active in ES cells and tissue-specific genes are sporadically expressed at low levels. Whole genome tiling arrays demonstrate widespread transcription in both coding and non-coding regions in pluripotent ES cells whereas the transcriptional landscape becomes more discrete as differentiation proceeds. The transcriptional hyperactivity in ES cells is accompanied by disproportionate expression of chromatin-remodeling and the general transcription machinery, but not histone modifying activities. Interference with several chromatin remodeling activities in ES cells affects their proliferation and differentiation behavior. We propose that global transcriptional activity is a hallmark of pluripotent ES cells that contributes to their plasticity and that lineage specification is strongly driven by reduction of the actively transcribed portion of the genome.
