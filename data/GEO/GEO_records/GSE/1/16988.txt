TITLE
Expression profile of cell lines overexpressing miR-520g

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primitive neuro-ectodermal tumours (PNET) of the supratentorial region are rare, highly malignant embryonal brain tumours affecting young children. We recently highlighted the importance of a microRNA cluster housing miR-520g. We utilized the Illumina HumanWG-6 v3 R2 and HumanHT-12 v3 R2 Expression BeadChip platforms to profile the effects of miR-520g on gene expression. Keywords: gene expression, pediatric brain tumour, microRNA

DESIGN
We stably transfected human neural stem cells with miR-520g or pcDNA plasmid. They were cultured under differentiating conditions and subsequently harvested for microarray analysis. We performed two independent experiments with at least two technical replicates each. Non-normalized data for Samples GSM425301-GSM425312 are available in the supplementary file 'GSE16988_GPL6884_non-normalized_data.txt'; non-normalized data for Samples GSM425313-GSM425318 are available in the supplementary file 'GSE16988_GPL6947_non-normalized_data.txt'.
