TITLE
Maize gene expression during infection with Ustilago maydis strain SG200∆fox1

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Ustilago maydis is a plant-pathogenic fungus that establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host Zea mays. The biotrophic interaction is initiated upon host penetration, and involves expansion of the host plasma membrane around hyphae, which is thought to facilitate the exchange of nutrients and virulence factors. Transcriptional regulators involved in the establishment of an infectious dikaryon and penetration into the host have been identified, however, regulators involved in the post-penetration stages remained to be elucidated. In the study we report the identification of an Ustilago maydis forkhead transcription factor, Fox1, which is exclusively expressed during biotrophic development. Deletion of fox1 results in reduced virulence and impaired tumour development in planta. Δfox1 hyphae induce plant defences including the overproduction and accumulation of H2O2 in and around infected cells. This oxidative burst acts as an intercellular signal, which elicits a specific host defence response phenotypically represented by the encasement of proliferating hyphae in extensions of the plant cell wall. Maize microarrays experiments were performed to identify genes involved in the observed plant defence responses on leaf tissue infected with U. maydis strain SG200∆fox1 4 dpi.
