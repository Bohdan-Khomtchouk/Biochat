ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The series is composed of thirty hybridizations for analysis of differentially expressed genes in normal placenta tissues from patients with normal labor and placenta tissues from patients with severe preeclampsia. Patients tissues samples were obtained from (Vasilis. Total RNA extraction was performed by using the MagNa Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). Keywords: Gene expression study, Disease state
