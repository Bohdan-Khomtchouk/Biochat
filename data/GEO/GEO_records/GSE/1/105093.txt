TITLE
Whole-Genome Methylation Profile of Fibroblast-Derived Isogenic Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The paper reports data on measuring whole-genome DNA methylation using an Illumina 450K Methylation BeadChip platform for isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of a healthy donor and a PARK-associated Parkinson's disease patient via integrating (lentiviral transfection) and non-integrating (Sendai virus infection) reprogramming. Data on whole-genome methylation of neurons generated by differentiation of the iPSCs were also presented. The iPSCs were reprogrammed using the four Yamanakaâ€™s factors: OCT4 (POU5F1), SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC. The data evidence that there are no significant differences in whole-genome methylation of iPSCs produced by various methods.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
