TITLE
Divergent transcription from active promoters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we describe a novel class of short RNAs and high-resolution ChIP-Seq data that together indicate widespread divergent transcription at mammalian promoters and suggest the existence of novel regulatory mechanisms concerning both initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II.
