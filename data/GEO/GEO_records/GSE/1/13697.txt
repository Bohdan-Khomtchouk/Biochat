TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in an Animal Model of Cortical Dysplasia-IRRADIATED GROUP

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cortical Dysplasia (CD) is the histopathological substrate in almost half of all drug-resistant epilepsy. Little is known about the gene expression profile of CD. As such information may help target therapeutics more effectively, our aim was to perform a gene expression analysis of an animal model of cortical dysplasia induced by in utero irradiation. THIS SERIES (GSE13697) INCLUDES ALL (AND ONLY) EXPERIMENTAL SAMPLES--I.E. IRRADIATED/CORTICAL DYSPLASIA (9).
