TITLE
P13 cortex RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To estimate transcripts levels in P13 mouse neocortex. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites.  We used HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native Argonaute (Ago) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain.  This produced two simultaneous datasets—Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites—that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNA-target mRNA interaction sites.  We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain.  Here we include the expression data obtained from dissected P13 mouse neocortex. These data are used for in silico CLIP simulation for normalization of Ago HITS-CLIP tags and also for selecting transcripts expressed in P13 mouse cortex.

DESIGN
RNA from the neocortex of 3 wild type P13 CD1 mice.  One array per biological replicate.
