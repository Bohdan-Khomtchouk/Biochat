TITLE
Molecular Dissection of Pea Shoot Apical Meristem

ORGANISM
Pisum sativum

SUMMARY
Knowledge about an organismâ€™s cell and tissue-specific transcriptional repertoire is essential for understanding the gene regulatory circuits that control key developmental events.  The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is responsible for development of all the above ground parts of plants.  Our understanding of SAM at the molecular level is far from complete.  The present work investigates the global gene expression repertoire of SAMs in the garden pea (Pisum sativum).  To this end, 10,346 EST sequences representing 7611 unique genes were generated from pea SAM cDNA libraries.  These sequences, together with previously reported ESTs, were used to construct a 12K oligonucleotide array used to identify genes exhibiting differential SAM expression, as compared to the axillary meristem, root apical meristem, and non-meristematic tissues.  We identified a number of genes that are predominantly expressed in specific cell layers or domains of the SAM, and thus are likely components of the gene networks involved in stem cell maintenance and initiation of lateral organ primordial cells.  In situ hybridization confirmed the spatial localisation of some of these key genes within the SAM.  Our data also indicate the diversification of some gene expression patterns and functions in legume crop plants.
