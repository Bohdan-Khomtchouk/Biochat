TITLE
Esophageal keratinocyte invasion after loss of E-cadherin and TGF receptor type II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers as patients present at late stages of disease. Frequent gene alterations include the loss of E-cadherin and TGFb receptor type II. The goal of this study was to establish a model of esophageal cancer by introducing dominant-negative mutants of E-cadherin and TGFb receptor II. To analyze the functional consequences and gene expression chages induced by E-cadherin and TGFb receptor type II loss in esophageal cancer.
