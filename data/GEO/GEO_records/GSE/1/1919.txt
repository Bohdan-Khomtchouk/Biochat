SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory joint disease of unknown etiology and pronounced inter-patient heterogeneity. To characterize RA at the molecular level and to uncover key pathomechanisms, we performed whole-genome gene expression analyses. Synovial tissues from rheumatoid arthritis patients were compared to those from osteoarthritis patients and to normal donors. Keywords: disease state analysis
