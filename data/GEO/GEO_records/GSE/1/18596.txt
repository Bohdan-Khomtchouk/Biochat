TITLE
RNAs expression profiling in a resistant and a susceptible grapevine cultivar to Plasmopara viticola

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Plasmopara viticola (Berk. and Curt.) Berl. and de Toni is the agent of the destructive disease known as grapevine downy mildew, for the control of which intensive fungicide treatments are required. Natural sources of resistance are available in several wild Vitis species, which are being used in traditional breeding approaches. However, molecular switches, signals and effectors involved in resistance are poorly understood. In this paper we report a microarray analysis of early transcriptional changes associated to P. viticola infection in both susceptible Vitis vinifera and resistant Vitis riparia plants (12 and 24 h post inoculation). To provide a biological basis to the choice of time points for transcriptome analyses, we performed microscopic examinations of infected tissues at 12, 24, 48 and 96 hpi.  Data suggest that resistance in V. riparia is mainly a post-infectional event and involves a large reprogramming of host metabolism. Transcripts of signal transduction-related genes are specifically and often strongly accumulated in response to infection. Well known defence genes also show marked transcript increases, especially  pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10 and stylbene synthases, and genes related to an hypersensitive reaction. On the other hand, V. vinifera mounts a much weaker transcriptional response, involving mainly defence genes,  not effective enough in preventing pathogen infection.
