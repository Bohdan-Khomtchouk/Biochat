TITLE
Substantial equivalence in transgenic barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
In this study, possible adverse effects of transgene expression in field-grown barley were assessed in relation to the influence of genetic background and to the impact of interaction with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi. The deposited microarray data originate from a parallel transcript profiling, metabolome profiling and metabolic fingerprinting approach with the wild type cultivars Golden Promise (GP) and Baronesse (B) as well as barley transgenics with i) seed-specific expression of (1,3-1,4)-ß-glucanase (GluB) being introgressed from the Golden Promise (GP) into the cultivar Baronesse (B) and ii) ubiquitous expression of codon-optimized Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase (ChGP).  Our conclusion from the results is that cultivar-specific differences and even the presence of few introgressed alleles exceed the effects on transcriptome and metabolome caused by transgene expression. Mycorrhization was shown to have more prominent effects on the metabolome than on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Hordeum vulgare plants were cultivated in the field in 2007 at Giessen Experimental station (165m elevation over NN, 1540h sunshine and 650mm precipitation per year in average) in replicated blocks, each consisted of eight 0.8 m × 0.5 m plots in which genotypes were randomly distributed and half of the plots were pretreated with Amykor® (containing the arbuscular fungi Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae). Ten pools of leaf material of at least 10 leaves per pool were sampled in the middle of the light period four months after planting. Two replicates of each genotype were subjected to microarray analysis.
