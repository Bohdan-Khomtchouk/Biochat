TITLE
Small RNAs subcellular distribution in breast cancer and normal cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detect the small RNAs subcellular distribution in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and normal cell line MCF-10A.

DESIGN
Each cell line, we detected the nuclear and cytoplasmic small RNAs expression intensity; and then we could get the nuclear-cytoplasmic-ratio.
