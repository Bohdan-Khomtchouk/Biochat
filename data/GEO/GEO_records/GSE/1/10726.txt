TITLE
Expression data from skin of epithelial activated beta-catenin mutant mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Î²-catenin signaling is required for hair follicle development, but it is unknown whether it is sufficient to activate expression of hair follicle genes in embryonic skin. To address this we profiled gene expression in skin dissected from E14.5 KRT14-Cre Ctnnb1(Ex3)fl/+ embryos carrying an activating mutation in epithelial beta-catenin, and control littermate embryos. Keywords: Genetic modification
