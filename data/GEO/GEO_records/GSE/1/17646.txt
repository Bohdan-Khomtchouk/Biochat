TITLE
Identification of Recurrence-Related microRNAs in the Bone Marrow of Breast Cancer Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA microarray analysis was performed to compare microRNA levels in bone marrow from 4 breast cancer patients with recurrent disease and 4 patients without recurrence.

DESIGN
To achieve this goal, we used microRNA microarray analysis to compare microRNA expression in bone marrow from breast cancer patients with and without disease recurrence.
