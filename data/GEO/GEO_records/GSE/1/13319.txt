Comparison of Human and Rat Uterine Leiomyoma: Identification of a Dysregulated mTOR Pathway

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are benign tumors of the uterine myometrium that significantly affect up to 30% of reproductive-age women. Despite being the primary cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for up to 200,000 procedures annually, the etiology of leiomyoma remains largely unknown.  Due to the lack of an effective medicinal therapy for these tumors, this disease continues to have a tremendous negative impact on womenâ€™s health. As a basis for understanding leiomyoma pathogenesis and identifying targets for pharmacotherapy, we conducted transcriptional profiling of leiomyoma and unaffected myometrium from humans and Eker rats, the best characterized preclinical model of leiomyoma. A global comparison of mRNA from leiomyoma versus myometrium in human and rat identified a highly significant overlap of dysregulated gene expression in leiomyoma.  An unbiased pathway analysis using a method of gene set enrichment based on the Sigpathway algorithm detected the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as one of the most highly upregulated pathways in both human and rat tumors. Activation of this pathway was confirmed in both human and rat leiomyomata at the protein level via Western.  Inhibition of mTOR in female Eker rats with the rapamycin analog WAY-129327 for 2 weeks decreased mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in tumors, and treatment for 4 months significantly decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and size. These results identify dysregulated mTOR signaling as a component of leiomyoma etiology across species and directly demonstrate the dependence of these tumors on mTOR signaling for growth in the Eker rat. Modulation of this pathway warrants additional investigation as a potential therapy for uterine leiomyoma. Keywords: Disease State Analysis: Animal Model Validation
