TITLE
High-Resolution DNA Binding Specificity Analysis of Yeast Transcription Factors

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying rRNA processing gene regulation during heat shock.  PBF1 is YBL054W (TOD6) and PBF2 is YER088C (DOT6).
