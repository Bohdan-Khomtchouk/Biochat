TITLE
MG1655 temperature O2 response normalized data Tavazoie

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Microarray transcriptional profiling was utilized to observe the global cellular state correlates of the physiological responses to temperature and oxygen changes.  We provide evidence for the existence of correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the co-occurrence of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal-tract. Keywords: time course
