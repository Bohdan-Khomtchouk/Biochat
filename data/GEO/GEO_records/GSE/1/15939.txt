TITLE
Transcript profiling in LTR mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
STN7-dependent phosphorylation of an as yet unknown thylakoid protein triggers the signaling events associated with the  long-term acclimatory response (LTR). The LTR-associated signaling events regulate the expression of photosynthesis-related genes on the post-transcriptional level (nucleus), as indicated by transcript profiling in LTR mutants.

DESIGN
5 µg of total RNA of two to three biological replicates of the different pools (10 plants each pool) of rosette leaves of 4-week-old Col-0, Wassilewskija, stn7-1, psad1-1, stn7-1 psad1-1, psae1-3 and stn7-1 psae1-3 plants was processed and hybridized to a GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array using the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix); psad1 (2 replicates) psad1 stn7 (3 replicates) Col-0 (3 replicates) Ws (2 replicates) psae (2 replicates) psae stn7 (2 replicates) stn7 (3 replicates)
