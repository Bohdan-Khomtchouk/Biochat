TITLE
Expression data from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

ORGANISM

We used microarrays to determine global gene expression in primary tumor tissues (ESCC) and matched normal tissues (adjacent normal esophageal mucosa)

DESIGN
Paired primary ESCC tumor and normal tissues were compared (n=5).
