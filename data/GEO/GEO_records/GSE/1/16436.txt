TITLE
Transcriptomes of covR/S mutant strains of S. pyogenes

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi

SUMMARY
Two covR mutant derivatives of parental strain MGAS2221 were recovered from mice experimentally infected with MGAS2221 and shown to differ in terms of the number and concentration of secreted proteins.  One of the covR mutant strains had a secretion phenotype identical to a covS mutant strain, while the other had a secretion phenotype identical to a constructed covR mutant strain.  To further investigate the potential differences between the two covR mutant strains we performed expression microarray analysis.
