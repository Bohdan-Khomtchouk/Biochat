TITLE
Microcystin Genomic Effects on Zebrafish Larvae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were obtained from the Zebrafish Research Facility maintained in the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at the University of Tennessee.  Fish husbandry, spawning, and experimental procedures were conducted with approval from the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #1690-1007).  Water for holding fish and conducting experiments (hereafter referred to as fish water) consisted of MilliQ water (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with ions added: 19 mg/L NaHCO3, 1 mg/L sea salt (Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt, Mentor, OH), 10 mg/L CaSO4, 10 mg/L MgSO4, 2 mg/L KCl.  Embryos were obtained by spawning adult fish with no history of contaminant exposure.  Fertilization of embryos took place at the same time (± 15 min.), such that larvae used in experiments were of similar age at the time of exposure.  All activities (maintenance of adult fish, spawning, and experiments) were conducted in an environmental chamber with a temperature of 27± 1 ºC and 14:10h light:dark photoperiod.
