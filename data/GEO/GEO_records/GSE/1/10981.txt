TITLE
Effect of dietary immunostimulation in gills and intestine of rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The effect of dietary immunostimulation in the portals of entry, intestine and gills, of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), was investigated using a salmonid-specific microarray platform enriched with immune-related genes. IS-diet feeding significantly changed transcriptomic expression profiles: larger reduction rather than induction was observed, with significant changes in genes and functional GO categories related to remodeling processes and antigen presentation.  The results revealed that one of the main effects of IS-diets in trout is the increase of genes involved in antigen recognition in epithelial cells of gills. Keywords: gills, intestine, immunostimulats, transcriptomic response, ISH, trout
