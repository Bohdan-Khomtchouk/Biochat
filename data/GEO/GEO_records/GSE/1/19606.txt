TITLE
ArrayCGH of Trichoderma reesei strains QM9123, QM9414, NG14 and RutC-30

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Trichoderma reesei is the main industrial producer of cellulases and hemicellulases used to depolymerize biomass in many biotechnical applications. Many production strains in use have been generated by classical mutagenesis. In this study we characterized genomic alterations in hyperproducing mutants of T. reesei by high-resolution comparative genomic hybridisation tiling array. We carried out aCGH analysis of four hyperproducing strains (QM9123, QM9414, NG14 and RutC-30) using QM6a genome as a reference. ArrayCGH analysis identified dozens of mutations in each strain analyzed.

DESIGN
2.1 million oligonucleotide probe custom aCGH (HD2 format, RocheNimblegen) was designed according to T. reesei strain QM6a genome v2.0 ( ). 14 samples are included in this set; 3 replicates of each strain (except two replicates of QM9123) were analyzed (four mutant strains and QM6a control strain for self-hybridization)
