TITLE
Changes in gene expression resulting from expression of MN1 in human CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reintroduction of CEBPA in MN1-overexpressing hematopoietic cells prevents their hyper-proliferation and restores myeloid differentiation. Forced expression of MN1 in primitive mouse hematopoietic cells causes acute myeloid leukemia and impairs all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced granulocytic differentiation. Here, we studied the effects of MN1 on myeloid differentiation and proliferation using primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells, lineage depleted mouse bone marrow cells, and bipotential (granulocytic/monocytic) human AML-cell lines. We show that exogenous MN1 stimulated the growth of CD34+ cells, which was accompanied by enhanced survival and increased cell cycle traverse in cultures supporting progenitor cell growth. Forced MN1 expression impaired both granulocytic and monocytic differentiation in vitro in primary hematopoietic cells and AML cell lines. Endogenous MN1 expression was higher in human CD34+ cells compared to both primary and in vitro differentiated monocytes and granulocytes. Microarray and real time RT-PCR analysis of MN1-overexpressing CD34+ cells showed down regulation of CEBPA and its downstream target genes. Re-introduction of conditional and constitutive CEBPA overcame the effects of MN1 on myeloid differentiation and inhibited MN1-induced proliferation in vitro. These results indicate that down regulation of CEBPA activity contributes to MN1-modulated proliferation and impaired myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic cells

DESIGN
Human BM derived CD34+ cells (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) were expanded for 2 days and transduced with MSCV-IRES-GFP or MSCV-MN1-IRES-GFP retrovirus for another 2 days. One day later RNA was isolated from GFP+/CD34+ FACS-sorted cells using Trizol (Sigma) and samples were subjected to micro array analysis following Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the GeneChip Human U133 Plus 2.0 array
