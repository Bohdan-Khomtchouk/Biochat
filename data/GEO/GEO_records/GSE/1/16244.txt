TITLE
seed specific genes-Establishing the network of seed gene expression and analysis of its biodiversity

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp3_tri33-arabidoseed - seed specific genes - WP3 : Biodiversity of seed traits : state of the art - This experiment aimed to identify the genes expressed in the seeds vs siliques (easiest to harvest), and to know if the expression pattern of the whole silique could provide a valuable information. Keywords: organ comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
