TITLE
Widespread over-expression of the X chromosome in sterile F1 hybrid mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a reciprocal cross of Mus musculus and M. domesticus in which F1 males are sterile in one direction and fertile in the other direction, in order to associate expression differences with sterility.
