TITLE
Expression Profiling of HL-60 Cells Stimulated by ATRA and DMSO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stimulation of HL60 progenitor cells with either DMSO (1.25% v/v) or atRA (10E-07M) resulted in their differentiation into neutrophils within six days. Gene expression profiles across 12 600 genes were measured for the differentiation processes induced by DMSO and atRA at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 18 h and daily thereafter until day 7 using oligonucleotide DNA microarrays. Keywords: time course, differentiation, cell fate transitions
