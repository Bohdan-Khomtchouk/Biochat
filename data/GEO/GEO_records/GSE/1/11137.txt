SUMMARY
Titin is a striated muscle-specific giant elastic protein and largely responsible for the generation of the diastolic force in the cardiac myocyte. Cardiac titin undergoes developmental changes in isoform expression during the course of cardiac development. At present, at least five size classes of titin isoforms (N2B and N2BA-A1, A2, N1, N2) have been identified using SDS agarose gel electrophoresis. The larger titin isoform N2BAs gradually decreased with ages, in contrast, the smaller titin isoform N2B increased in normal cardiomyocyte, and cardiac myocytes containing a higher proportion of the smaller titin isoform N2B have stronger passive tension than that with a lower proportion of the larger titin isoform N2BAs. Recently we found an autosomal dominant mutation which caused totally opposite cardiac titin isoform expression as compared to developmental stages. The larger total titin isoform N2BA increased in mutant rat cardiac myocytes with ages instead of the smaller cardiac titin isoform N2B. For the moment, mechanism of titin isoform switch is still unknown, therefore, the mutant rats will give us nevol sight to elucidate the titin splicing mechanism. Keywords: Titin isoforms, autosomal dominant mutation
