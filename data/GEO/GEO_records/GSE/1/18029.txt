TITLE
Global profiling of gene expression in A signal mutants of Myxococcus xanthus

ORGANISM
Myxococcus xanthus

SUMMARY
In response to starvation Myxococcus xanthus initiates a developmental program that culminates in the formation of fruiting bodies inside which the rod-shaped cells differentiate to spores. Fruiting body formation depends on intercellular communication and two intercellular signals are known, the A-signal and the C-signal. Five genes have been identified which are required for A-signal synthesis. To begin to understand the function of the genes required for A-signal synthesis, we have analysed gene expression in the asgA and the asgB mutant. Keywords: Vegetative cells of WT (DK1622) and AsgA mutant (DK5057) and AsgB mutant (DK4398)

DESIGN
3 biological replicates each; normalized ratios to vegetative cells of  DK1622 (wt) Cy5
