TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of green spotted puffer fish gills in response to environmental calcium changes

ORGANISM
Tetraodon nigroviridis

SUMMARY
This study aims to understand the molecular adaptation mechanisms of fish gills to environmental Ca2+ changes. Using SuperSAGE, we compared the gene expression profiles of T. nigroviridis gills transferred from natural brackish water (10 ppt salinity,2.9 mM Ca2+)  to artificial brackish water with control (2.9 mM), low (0.01 mM) or high (10 mM) Ca2+ concentrations for 2 or 12h.

DESIGN
To obtain SuperSAGE tags, we followed the original protocol described by Matsumura and colleagues (Matsumura et al. 2003) with some modifications. The SuperSAGE ditags were directly sequenced with by high throughput pyrosequencing (454 LifeSciences).
