TITLE
Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei in the human brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed comprehensive DNA methylation analysis in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei obtained from the human prefrontal cortex. This revealed that neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei manifest qualitatively and quantitatively distinctive DNA methylation patterns.

DESIGN
Profiling methylation pattern using methylated DNA enriched fraction by MethylCollector vs unmethylated DNA enriched fraction by McrBC treatment. Bar files (see Sample supplementary files) were generated by MAT software and contain MAT scores in each probe.  Three bed files (see supplementary files linked below) contain high quality methylated regions in the neuronal, non-neuronal, or both fractions. After the consideration of effect of restriction enzymes, they are extracted based on the commonly methylated regions in all the relevant samples and that MAT score p values < 0.0001 in each sample.
