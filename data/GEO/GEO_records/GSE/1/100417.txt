TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of WT versus HEB-/- hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine genome-wide changes in mRNA expression, we performed RNA-Seq on HEB-/- and WT hESCs. There were 274 significant changes in mRNA expression (p < 0.05) between HEB-/- and WT hESCs; 126 transcripts were lower and 148 transcripts were higher

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of  wild type (WT) and HEB-/- hESCs were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
