SUMMARY
Cervical cancer develops from pre-cancerous high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions harbouring a transforming infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), which is characterised by p16INK4a overexpression. Since it takes one or more decades for these pre-cancerous lesions to progress to invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), it is obvious that they are heterogeneous in terms of duration of existence and progression risk. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) of 46 p16INK4a immuno-positive CIN2/3 lesions to determine whether this heterogeneity is reflected in their chromosomal profiles. Chromosomal profiles of CIN2/3 lesions were related to those of invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and promoter methylation of the CADM1 gene, a tumour suppressor gene known to be functionally involved in the tumorigenic phenotype of cervical cancer cells. Frequent alterations found in CIN2/3 lesions included gains located at chromosome 1, 3, 7 and 20 and losses located at 4, 11, 16, 17 and 19. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two subsets of CIN2/3 lesions, chromosomal profiles of one of which closely resembled invasive SCCs. Gains of 1, 3q and 20 were characteristic for CIN2/3 lesions with chromosomal signatures resembling carcinomas. In addition, dense promoter methylation of the CADM1 gene was significantly more frequent in these CIN2/3 lesions (p=0.004). No chromosomal alterations were detected in one p16INK4a positive and five p16INK4a negative CIN1 lesions. These findings suggest that biomarkers associated with gains at chromosomes 1, 3q and 20 are potential hallmarks of advanced p16INK4a positive CIN2/3 lesions with a high short-term risk of progression.
