TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of maize leaf at heading stage in response to water-deficit stress

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Periods of soil water deficit could occur at any time during the crop season, but maize is particularly sensitive to water stress around flowering time. At this time the stress usually causes remarkable yield loss. Heading time, which is just before tassel flowering, is one of the most important stages that maize productivity would be affected severely if plants encounter water stress. The whole-genomic gene expression changes of maize plants in response to water deficit stress at this stage have not been studied. The present work utilized an Arizona Maize Oligonucleotide Array Version 1.9ï¼Œwhich was consisted of A and B slides carrying with a total of 57,452 maize 70-mer oligonucleotides, was used to monitor gene expression profile changes in maize leaves subjected to 1 day and 7 days water-deficit stress respectively at the heading stage. Keywords: stress response
