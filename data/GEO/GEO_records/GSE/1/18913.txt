TITLE
siRNA-mediated Egr-3 knockdown in VEGF-treated HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with Egr-3 siRNA under the VEGF treatment for 0,1, and 4 h. Egr-3, a member of early growth response family, is  immediately and dramatically induced by VEGF in HUVEC, which regulates expression of many genes related to endothelial activation.

DESIGN
Total 21 samples were derived from triplicate arrays of VEGF-treated si-Control-transfected cells and duplicate arrays of each of the VEGF-treated si-Egr-3-transfected cells.
