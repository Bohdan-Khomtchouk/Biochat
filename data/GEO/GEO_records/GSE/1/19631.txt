TITLE
Global changes in gene expression in response to miR-200 overexpression in 4TO7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 4TO7 cells stably overexpressing miR-200s or CDH1. We observe a dramatic shift in the gene signatures when miR-200s (cluster 2; miR-200c/141, or both clusters) are overexpressed relative to controls. However, cluster 1 overexpression (miRs-200b/a/429) alone or CDH1 overexpression does not induce global changes in gene expression to levels observed for cluster 2 (miR-200c/141) or both clusters together.

DESIGN
One cell line (4TO7) cells: four different overexpression experiments, Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Clusters 1+2, CDH1, and respective controls, Puro vec, Hygro vec, Puro+Hygro vec and Puro vec. Each experiment has two biological replicates. Total, 16 samples.
