TITLE
Tumor T3 Sectors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The following CGH experiments were conducted on four sectors (S1-S4) from a single primary ductal carcinoma tumor (T3).

DESIGN
The genomic DNA from each tumor sector was labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to an 85K Bgl2 ROMA Microarray.  A normal reference male fibroblast was labeled with Cy3 as a control.  Samples were dye-swapped and the experiments were conducted in color-reversal.  The value data repesents a log ratio of the mean of two dye-swapped samples
