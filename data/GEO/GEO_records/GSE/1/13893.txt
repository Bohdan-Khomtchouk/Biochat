TITLE
Dynamic response of annexin A11-associated gene expression to cisplatin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Based on a time-course study of cisplatin response in ovarian cancer cells with/without suppression of annexin A11 expression using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a set of differentially expressed genes associated with annexin A11 expression and patterns of gene expressions in response to cisplatin exposure. Keywords: human ovarian cancer cell lines
