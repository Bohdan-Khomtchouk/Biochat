TITLE
E. coli K12 Bw25113/pCA24N-hha with 2 mM IPTG vs BW25113/pCA24N with 2 mM IPTG

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
gene expression profiles by overexpressing Hha from pCA24N-hha using 2 mM IPTG induction in BW25113 wild type suspension cells in LB medium at 37C relative to BW25113 carrying the empty vector plasmid in the same test conditions. Keywords: overexpression, gene expression profiles
