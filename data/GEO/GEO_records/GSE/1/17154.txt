TITLE
Gene expression studies in apparently normal, paired normal and malignant gastric tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of apparently normal gastric tissue (obtained from patients undergoing gastric surgery for Non-gastric cancers), paired normals (obtained from the same stomach as the gastric cancer but confirmed by frozen section not to harbour any tumour cells) and gastric cancer, with an intent to identify genes involved in the malignant transformation of normal gastric mucosa and to identify genes which can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis and potential targets for treatment Identification of novel prognostic markers using microarray gene expression studies. Keywords: Patient tissue samples

DESIGN
Two-dye experiments using Universal control RNA (Stratagene) and RNA from tissues. Biological replicates: Apparently Normal = 5; Paired Normal = 20; Gastric cancers = 24. One replicate per array.
