TITLE
Differential expression in lung and lymph node of pigs with high and low responses to infection with PRRSV

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
One hundred Hampshire by Duroc crossbred pigs (HD) and 100 NE Index line pigs (I) were infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and evaluated for resistance/susceptibility. Controls (100/line) were uninfected littermates to infected pigs. Viremia (V), weight change (WTΔ), and rectal temperature at 0, 4, 7, and 14 days post-infection (dpi) were recorded. Lung, bronchial lymph node (BLN), and blood tissue were collected at necropsy (14 dpi).  Infected pigs were classified as low or high responders to PRRSV based on the first principal component (PC) from principal component analyses of all variables. Low responders to PRRSV (low PRRSV burden) and their uninfected littermates were assigned to low (L) class.  High responders to PRRSV (high PRRSV burden) and their uninfected littermates were assigned to high (H) class.  Infected pigs in the L-class had high WTΔ, low V, and few lung lesions; H-class pigs had low WTΔ, high V, and many lung lesions. RNA was extracted from lung and BLN tissue of the seven highest and seven lowest responders per line and from each of their control littermates. A control reference design was used and cDNA from each reference sample tissue was prepared from pooled RNA extracted from two control pigs from each line whose infected littermates had a PC value of 0. Design variables in data analyses were line (I vs HD), class (H vs L), treatment (infected vs uninfected controls), and slide/pig as error.
