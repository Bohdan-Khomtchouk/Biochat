TITLE
Expression data from mouse collecting duct cell, mpkCCD, in response to a peptide hormone vasopressin analog, dDAVP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vasopressin is the major hormone that regulates renal water excretion.  It does so by binding to a receptor in renal collecting duct cells, triggering signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the abundance, location, and activity of the water channel protein aquaporin 2.  We took an advantage of quantitative large scale proteomic technologies and oligonucleotide microarrays to quantify steady state changes in protein and transcript abundances in response to vasopressin in a collecting duct cell line, mpkCCD clone 11 (Yu et al. PNAS 2009, 106:2441-2446).  This cell line originally developed by Alan Vandewalleâ€™s group recapitulates vasopressin-mediated AQP2 expression and phosphorylation as seen in native colleting duct cells.

DESIGN
The mpkCCD cells were grown on membrane supports to permit polarization.  Once transepithelial resistance reached 5kohm per centimeter square and higher, the cells were exposed to the vasopressin V2 receptor analog, dDAVP, at a physiological concentration, 0.1nM, for 5 days.  Control experiments were done with cells exposed to vehicle alone.  Total RNA was harvested and processed for transcript expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.  Each experimental treatment, vehicle and dDAVP, was repeated 3 times.
