TITLE
Identification of RNAs that are physically and functionally associated with RNase P

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Numerous RNAs copurify with RNase P and are affected by temperture sensitive mutations in conserved residues with the essential RNA and protein subunits.  Specifically, RNase P physically interacts with ribosomal protein mRNAS and the intron-encoded box C/D snoRNAs. Keywords: RNA copurification, temperature sensitive mutants
