TITLE
Preconception Urinary Phthalate Concentrations and Sperm DNA Methylation Profiles among Men Undergoing IVF Treatment: A Cross-Sectional Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To answer the question of whether preconception phthalate and phthalate replacements associated with sperm differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among men undergoing in-vitro fertilization, genome-wide DNA-methylation profiles of 48 human sperm samples were generated by  bisulfite-based Illumina 450K BeadChip arrays. The sperm DNA methylation is then correlated with urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations.

DESIGN
A cross-sectional study of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and sperm genomic DNA methylation generated from Illumina 450K. The sperm was from participants recruited from an IVF and the urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations are measured via mass spec. Please note that [1] the 'Exposure_Matrix.csv' contains the data used for analysis and necessary for differentiating samples and [2] the'readme_for_Exposure_Matrix.txt' contains the column header information.
