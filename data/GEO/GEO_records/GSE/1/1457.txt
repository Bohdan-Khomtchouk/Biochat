TITLE
CxVB3 infection and cardiac function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male, adolescent A/J mice (4-5 week old) were either infected (IP) with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3; 105 pfu) or PBS. CVB3 is a cardiotropic virus which leads to cardiac inflammation and fibrosis within 9 days after IP injection. We wanted to know how the virus would impact long term cardiac function, and whether changes in cardiac function could be associated with cardiac transcriptional regulation. At days 3, 9 and 30 days post-infection, hearts were imaged with 2D echocardiography (Sonos 5500, Philips). Briefly, mice were anesthesized subcutaneously with ketamine (0.45mg/kg) and xylazine (0.03mg/kg). Mice were placed in a dorsal recumbency position and the following systolic and diastolic measurements were taken (N=5 heart beats) using an S-12 (12MHz; Sonos 5000, Philips) probe: parasternal long axis, and short axis at the level of the mitral valve and papillary muscles. Measurements were utilized for calculation of wall thickness and functional parameters. Then, heart tissues were flash frozen (N=4 mice/group except CVB3 infected 30 day samples N=2) for hybridization to Affymetrix MG U74Av2 arrays. Keywords: time-course
