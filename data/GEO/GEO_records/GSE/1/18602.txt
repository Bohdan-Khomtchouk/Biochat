TITLE
Microglia in ischemic brain injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microglia are resident CNS immune cells that are active sensors in healthy brain and versatile effectors under pathological conditions. Cerebral ischemia induces a robust neuroinflammatory response that includes marked changes in the gene expression and phenotypic profile of a variety of endogenous CNS cell types (astrocytes, neurons, microglia) as well as an influx of leukocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages, T-cells) from the periphery. Many molecules and conditions can trigger a transformation of “resting” (or surveying) microglia to an “activated” (alerted/reactive) state. Here we review recent developments in the literature that relate to microglial activation in the experimental setting of in vitro and in vivo ischemia. We also present new data from our own laboratory demonstrating the direct effects of in vitro ischemic conditions on the microglial phenotype and genomic profile. Emphasis is placed on the role of specific molecular signaling systems such as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in regulating the microglial response in this setting. We then review histological and recent novel radiological data that confirms a key role for microglial activation in the setting of ischemic stroke in humans. We discuss recent progress in the pharmacological and molecular targeting of microglia in acute ischemic stroke. Finally, we explore how recent studies on ischemic preconditioning have increased interest in preemptively targeting microglial activation in order to reduce stroke severity.

DESIGN
12 arrays, 4 experimental groups, 3 replicates in each group, CN is control normoxia, CH is control hypoxia, TN is TLR4 knockout normoxia, TH is TLR4 knockout hypoxia.
