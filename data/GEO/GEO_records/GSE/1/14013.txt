TITLE
Sex biased gene expression in 17 weeks old chicken (ovary, testes)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Sex chromosomes are characterized by a non-random content of genes with preferential expression in one sex. The mechanisms which are responsible for this phenomenon are, however, largely unresolved. To elucidate selective forces shaping the Z chromosome gene content in chicken, we analyzed microarray data from adult and embryonic gonads (the latter already available in GEO Series GSE8693).
