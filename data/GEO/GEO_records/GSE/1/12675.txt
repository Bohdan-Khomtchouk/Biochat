TITLE
Hypoxia effect on embryonic hearts of Tibetan Chicken, Dwarf Recessive White Chicken and Shouguang Chicken

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Adaptation to hypoxia is a complicated and important physiological course for organisms, but the genetic mechanism underlying the adaptation is not fully understood yet. Tibetan Chicken (T), an indigenous chicken breed in China which inhabit in high areas with an altitude above 2,900 meters. Shouguang Chicken(S) and Dwarf Recessive White Chicken (DRW), two lowland chicken breeds, were used as control groups. The heart was the first functional organ to develop during the embryonic development. Furthermore, the heart is an efficient energy converter utilizing the most appropriate fuel for a given environment. Therefore, GeneChipÂ® Chicken Genome Array was employed to identify the differentially expressed genes in embryonic hearts of Tibetan Chicken and two lowland chicken breeds in both hypoxic and normoxic incubating environments with a genome wide profile. Keywords: stress response
