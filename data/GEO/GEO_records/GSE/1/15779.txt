TITLE
Gene expression analysis of pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genome-wide gene expressions of iPS stem cell with controls, both stem cells and parental cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of stem cell differentiation. Keywords: Expression profiling by array, count

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 9 iPS stem cell, 4 stem cells, and 3 somatic cells. 2 replicates for most of them.
