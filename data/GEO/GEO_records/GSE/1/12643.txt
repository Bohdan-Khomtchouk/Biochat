TITLE
Transcription profiling of myotubes from patients with type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based studies of skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes and high-risk individuals have demonstrated that insulin resistance and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis co-exist early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes independent of hyperglycaemia and obesity. It is unknown whether reduced mitochondrial biogenesis or other transcriptional alterations co-exist with impaired insulin-responsiveness in primary human muscle cells from patients with type 2 diabetes. Results: No single gene was differently expressed after correction for multiple testing, and no biological pathway was differently expressed using both approaches for global pathway analysis. In particular, we found no evidence for differential expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Consistently, there was no difference in mRNA levels of genes known to mediate the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis, PPARGC1A and NRF-1, or in mitochondrial mass between diabetic and control myotubes.
