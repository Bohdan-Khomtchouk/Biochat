TITLE
Atf1-mediated active gene response to H2O2 challenge.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Here we present the study on ChIP-chip mapping of the genomic binding sites for Sty1, Atf1, and the Atf1's binding partner Pcr1; the genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the atf1 and pcr1 strains in response to H2O2; and the phenotypic assessment of ~90 Atf1/Pcr1-bound or unbound genes for growth fitness under H2O2 conditions. ChIP-chip analysis shows that Atf1 and Pcr1 binding sites are overlapped in the genome and constitutively present before H2O2 stress. On the other hand, Sty1 recruitment primarily occurs at the Atf1/Pcr1 binding sites and is induced by H2O2. We found that Atf1/Pcr1 is clearly responsible for the high-level transcriptional response to H2O2. Furthermore, phenotypic assessment indicates that among the H2O2-induced genes, Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes exhibit a higher likelihood of functional requirement for growth fitness under the stress condition than the Atf1/Pcr1-unbound genes do. Notably, we found that the Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes regardless of their responsiveness to H2O2 show a high probability of requirement for growth fitness. .
