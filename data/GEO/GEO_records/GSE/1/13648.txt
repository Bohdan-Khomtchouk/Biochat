TITLE
Global identification of yeast chromosome interactions using genome conformation capture

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the global chromosomal interaction map for exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using Genome Conformation Capture. Interactions between chromosomes were identified within a population of yeast cells growing exponentially in a semi-defined medium containing glucose. The series contains the sequences of the ligated restriction fragments that identified the interactions.
