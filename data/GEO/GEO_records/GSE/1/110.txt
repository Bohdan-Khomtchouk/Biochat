TITLE
Bovine Glomerular and Aortic Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
SAGE libraries were prepared from mRNA of cultured bovine glomerular and aortic endothelial cells. Cells both cell lines were positive for acetylated LDL uptake and vWF expression, and were proven to be free of non-endothelial cells.  Cultures were studied at passage 9-10. The cells were confluent, cultured in parallel, under identical conditions. Cells were plated on gelatin coated cell culture plastic in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and streptomycin/penicillin. The last medium change was 48 hours prior to mRNA harvest. Keywords = endothelial, glomerular, kidney, aorta, Keywords: other
