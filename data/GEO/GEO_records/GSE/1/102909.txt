TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptomics following immunization with TLR-adjuvanted nanoparticle vaccine in rhesus macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) aim to disrupt malaria parasite development by targeting antigens expressed in the mosquito midgut and are considered an integral element of malaria eradication efforts. Here, we used non-human primates to demonstrate that immune responses to Pfs25, the leading TBV candidate, can be improved using unconjugated Pfs25 encapsulated in PLGA-based synthetic vaccine particles (SVP[Pfs25]) delivered subcutaneously, compared to the multimeric form, Pfs25-EPA administered intramuscularly. Pfs25-EPA given with the toll-like receptor (TLR)-based adjuvant GLA-LSQ induced robust Ab responses, but SVP[Pfs25] adjuvanted with GLA-LSQ or SVPs containing CpG or R848 increased Ab titers, Pfs25-specific plasmablasts, circulating memory B cells, and plasma cells in the bone marrow. Animals receiving R848 or CpG showed particularly strong type I IFN polarized innate activation, which correlated with increased Ab half-life. Only SVP[Pfs25] induced detectable Pfs25-specific CD4 Th1 and Tfh cells, correlating with improved Ab avidity. Collectively, multiple aspects of the responses elicited to Pfs25 indicate that the nanoparticle technology combined with TLR agonists is a promising platform for TBVs.

DESIGN
Four groups of rhesus macaques (n=6/group) were immunized with nanoparticles adjuvanted with nanoparticles containing CpG or R848 or the liposomal adjuvant GLA-LSQ. Whole blood was collected prior to and 24 hours after immunization and gene expression profiles were compared to cellular activation as determined by flow cytometry and cytokine production in plasma.
