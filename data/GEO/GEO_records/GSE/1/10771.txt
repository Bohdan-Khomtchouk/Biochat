TITLE
Norway Spruce Cultured Cells Chitosan

ORGANISM
Picea

SUMMARY
Conifer-specific responses to elicitation with the chemical elicitor chitosan have been investigated using a transcriptome analysis in Norway spruce using a cell suspension culture system that has been previously described (Phillips, Walter et al. 2007). This study has demonstrated that the early events following chitosan elicitation include calcium mediated signaling and an oxidative response that have not previously been described in intact trees. Keywords: stress response
