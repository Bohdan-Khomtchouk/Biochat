TITLE
The SaeR/S Gene Regulatory System is Essential for Innate Immune Evasion by Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Coxiella burnetii

SUMMARY
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is problematic both in hospitals and the community. Currently, we have limited understanding of mechanisms of innate immune evasion used by S. aureus. To that end, we created an isogenic deletion mutant in strain MW2 (USA400) of the saeR/S two-component gene regulatory system and studied its role in mouse models of pathogenesis and during human neutrophil interaction. In this study, we demonstrate saeR/S plays a distinct role in S. aureus pathogenesis and is vital for virulence of MW2 in a mouse model of sepsis. Moreover, deletion of saeR/S significantly impaired survival of MW2 in human blood and after neutrophil phagocytosis. Microarray analysis of genes influenced by saeR/S demonstrated SaeR/S of MW2 influences a wide variety of genes with diverse biological functions. These data shed new insight into how virulence is regulated in S. aureus and associates a specific staphylococcal gene-regulatory system with invasive staphylococcal disease.
