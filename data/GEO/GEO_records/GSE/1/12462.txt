TITLE
miRNA* loading on Ago2

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In flies, microRNAs (miRNAs) are synthesized as a short imperfect duplex, where the miRNA is paired to another small RNA, dubbed the " miRNA* " . Usually, miRNA*s are degraded in the last steps of miRNA maturation, but we found evidence that some of them can be loaded on the Ago2 protein.
