SUMMARY
Malignant cells show major disruptions in DNA methylation profiles which manifest as aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation of gene promoters as well as global genomic hypomethylation. To date, many genes with aberrant promoter hypermethylation have been identified in essentially all forms of cancer including cell cycle regulators, DNA repair genes, genes associated with apoptosis, hormonal regulation, detoxification, metastasis, angiogenesis, and many others We developed an effective high-resolution approach for mapping genome-wide, and cancer-specific DNA methylation profiles. We have used this approach to provide first genomic DNA methylation profiling in human paediatric osteosarcoma tumours
