TITLE
Genome-wide comparison of EpiSC lines derived from fertilized (FT) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide comparison of gene expression between EpiSC lines derived from fertilized (FT) embryos and somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT) embryos. EpiSC lines were derived from fertilized and somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos and cultured until 15 to 20 passages. RNA was then extracted in order to compare transcriptomic profiles.
