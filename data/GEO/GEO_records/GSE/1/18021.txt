TITLE
Budding yeast cohesin (Mcd1) distribution in mitotically arrested cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
genomic localization of the budding yeast cohesin complex was mapped in mitotically arrested cells by Mcd1 ChIP followed by hybridization to high-density tiled microarrays

DESIGN
Cells were synchronized first in G1 and then released into media containing the microtubule poison nocodazole. Cells were fixed and processed for ChIP once arrested as large-budded cells. Immunoprecipitated DNA and total genomic DNA not subjected to immunoprecipitation were competitively hybridized to Nimblegen whole genome arrays.
