TITLE
Global gene expression profile of primary human leukemic blasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to define the global gene expression profile of primary leukemic blasts from patients with different forms of myeloid leukemia and different FAB subtypes. Here we report the global gene expression profile of 2 patients with AML FAB M5, 2 patients with AML FAB M7, 3 patients with Down syndrome AML FAB M7 and 3 patients with Down syndrome transient leukemia.

DESIGN
Leukemic blasts were FACS sorted by their immunophenotype and expression profiles were generated by microarray.
