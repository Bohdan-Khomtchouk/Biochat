TITLE
E. coli K-12 hha hns: pCA24N-hnsK57N vs pCA24N-hns biofilm

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The global regulator, H-NS, controls genes related to stress response, biofilm formation, and virulence expression by recognizing the curved DNA and silences gene transcription acquired from lateral gene transfer.  Here, we rewired H-NS to control biofilm formation using protein engineering.  One H-NS variant, H-NS K57N was obtained to reduce biofilm formation 10-fold compared to H-NS wild-type. Whole-transcriptome analysis (BW25113 hha hns / pCA24N-hns K57N vs. BW25113 hha hns / pCA24N-hns) revealed that H-NS K57N represses biofilm formation through the interactinon with other nucleoid proteins, Cnu and StpA.  Remarkably, H-NS K57N enhanced the excision of defective prophage Rac while H-NS wild-type represses it, and H-NS controlled only Rac excision among E. coli prophages.  These results imply that the repression of Rac excision is one of the silencing manner for foreign genes by H-NS.  Also, the prophage excision not only led to the change of biofilm formation but also resulted in cell lysis through the expression of toxin protein HokD with reduced viability, which are important for cell physiology in response to the change of environmental conditions.  Hence, H-NS regulatory system may be evolved easily with specialized functions in terms of biofilm formation, prophage control, and cell lysis.
