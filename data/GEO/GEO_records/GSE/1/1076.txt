TITLE
5.0 mg/kg MeHg exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this time course pregnant CD-1 (outbred) dams were exposed to MeHg as monomethylmercuric chloride intraperitoneally on 9 d.p.c. The test dose of 5.0 mg/kg MeHg was selected as a dose with an estimated 20% increased risk for encephalopathy in term fetuses, with no evidence of maternal toxicosis. Sampling intervals ranged from 1.5h to 24.0h post-exposure. All measurements were on RNA from the embryonic forebrain (prosencephalon) using contemporous control embryos as a reference.
