TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of genes induced by thrombin at 2 hour and 8 hour in human aortic smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human aortic smooth muscles are quiesced for 24 hours followed by treatment with thrombin for 2 hours and 8 hours in presence or absence of cyclosporin A (10 micromolar) to analyze the effect of thrombin on expression pattern of various genes in presence of cyclosporin A.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from control and 2 hour or 8 hour of thrombin treatment
