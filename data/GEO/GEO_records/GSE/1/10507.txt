TITLE
Physiological and Transcriptional Responses of Nitrosomonas europaea to Toluene and Benzene Inhibition

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
The effects of the aromatic hydrocarbons benzene and toluene on Nitrosomonas europaea, a nitrifying bacterium that plays an important role in the removal of nitrogen from wastewater treatment plants, were studied in batch reactors.  Exposure to 20  M toluene and 40  M benzene resulted in a 50% reduction in nitrifying activity after 1 h.   However, Affymetrix microarray experiments detected no significant changes in gene expression in toluene exposed cells.  Cells exposed to benzene were found to up-regulate a gene cluster (NE 1545 - NE 1551).  This gene cluster appears to be involved with fatty-acid metabolism, lipid and membrane protein biosynthesis.  TEM experiments reveal that cells exposed to benzene decrease the thickness of their membrane and the membrane becomes more structured. Keywords: stress response, benzene, toluene
