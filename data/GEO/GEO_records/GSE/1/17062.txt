TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse glioma-initiating cell-like cells (GICs) and non-GICs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify factors involved in glioma-initiating cells (GICs), we compared gene expression between GIC-like cells and non-GICs.

DESIGN
Neural stem cells (NSCs) were transfected with pCMS-EGFP-HRasL61 and pBabe-neo by electroporation and cultured in 0.5 mg/ml neomycin. The GFP-positive stable NSCs (NSCL61s) were purified by flow cytometry. Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
