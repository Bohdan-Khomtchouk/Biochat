SUMMARY
Smoke released from burning vegetation functions as an important environmental signal promoting the germination of many plant species following a fire . It not only promotes the germination of species from fire-prone habitats, but several species from non-fire-prone areas also respond, including some crops. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of smoke-water led to the identification of a highly active butenolide compound, 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one. Several hypotheses have arisen regarding the molecular background of smoke and butenolide action. Contrary to the efforts to unravel the mode of action of smoke, the mechanism is still largely unknown. In this paper we demonstrate that although smoke-water and butenolide treatment of maize kernels results in a similar physiological response, the gene and protein expression patterns are quite different. Treatment with smoke-water enhanced the ubiquitination of proteins and activated protein-degradation-related genes. This effect was completely absent from butenolide-treated kernels, in which a specific aquaporin gene was distinctly upregulated. These findings indicate that other bioactive compounds present in smoke-water may act together, leading to accelerated protein turnover. The results highlight the importance of protein degradation and aquaporins in the seed germination process. Besides their obvious use in the sustainable agricultural practice, smoke and butenolide can be used in studies to gain further insight into the transcriptional changes during germination.
