Critical role for very-long chain sphingolipids in invariant natural killer T cell development and homeostasis

SUMMARY
The role of sphingolipids (SLs) in the immune system has come under increasing scrutiny recently due to the emerging contributions that these important membrane components play in regulating a variety of immunological processes. The acyl chain length of SLs appears particularly critical in determining SL function. Here we show a role for very-long acyl chain SLs (VLC-SLs) in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell maturation in the thymus and homeostasis in the liver. Ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) null mice, which lack VLC-SLs, were susceptible to a hepatotropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which is due to a reduction in the number of iNKT cells. Bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that hematopoietic-derived VLC-SLs are essential for maturation of iNKT cells in the thymus, whereas parenchymal-derived VLC-SLs are crucial for iNKT cell survival and maintenance in the liver. Our findings suggest a critical role for VLC-SL in iNKT cell physiology.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA profiles of 3-4 month old wild type (WT), WT iNKT cell transfered and CerS2-/-mice, infected or not with LCMV were generated by deep sequencing. Several replicateswere included and pocessed using the MARS-seq protocol  (Jaitin et al. 2014 Science.343:776-9) and sequencing in the Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument
