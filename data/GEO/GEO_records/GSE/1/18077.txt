TITLE
Arabidopsis lyrata small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequences from Arabidopsis lyrata leaves, as isolated from a single sample of rosette leaf tissue.  These data were analyzed to 1) examine microRNA processing accuracy in A. lyrata and 2) to examine patterns of 24nt siRNA accumulation in A. lyrata.

DESIGN
A single small RNA library from rosette leaf tissue was analyzed using an Illumina Genome Analyzer.
