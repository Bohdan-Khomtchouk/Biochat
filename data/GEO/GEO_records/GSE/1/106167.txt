TITLE
miRNAs analysis of Sika deer antler at different stages (15 d and 60 d)

ORGANISM
Cervus nippon

SUMMARY
Deer antlers are amazing natural appendages that grow faster than any other known mammalian bone. Antler growth occurs at the tip and is initially cartilage, which is later replaced by bone tissue. However, little is known regarding the precise role of cooperation between cell lineages and functional genes in regulating antler growth, and molecular mechanisms responsible for rapid growth remain elusive. In this study, we use an RNA-Seq approach to identify miRNA expression patterns during antler growth.

DESIGN
2 samples
