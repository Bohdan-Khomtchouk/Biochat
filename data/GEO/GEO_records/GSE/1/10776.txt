TITLE
Expression profiles of Embryonic stem cells derived from normal fertilization and parthenogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the imprinting loci, we designed microarray analysis on the parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells and normal embryos. We could predict 217 imprinting domains associated with embryo development and maternal imprinting. Keywords: Cell type comparison
