TITLE
Potential forensic application of DNA methylation profiling for identical twin identification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 12 paired monozygotic twin samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in 12 paired monozygotic twin samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 24 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
