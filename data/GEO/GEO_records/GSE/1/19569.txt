TITLE
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and GCR2 deletion strain

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and GCR2 deletion strain. Impact of the transcription factor Gcr2p on mRNA expression was investigated in the corresponding deletion strain in exponentially growing glucose minimal medium batch cultures.
