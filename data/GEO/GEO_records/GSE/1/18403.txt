TITLE
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in FEAT transgenic mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mice (n= 40) overexpressing FEAT in the thymus, spleen, liver, and lung developed malignant lymphoma (47.5%, 19/40) and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) (35%, 14/40).  Notably, HCC arose in half (13/26) of the male transgenic mice, indicating a strong male predilection similar to human HCC.  Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) suggested that HCC in FEAT transgenic mice recapitulates human hepatocarcinogenesis.
