TITLE
Comparison of DNA methylation profiles in diploid and transformed tetraploid MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We propose that tetraploidy induces epigentic changes including DNA methylation due to the abnormal chromatin in the cells. To test our hypothesis, we employed methylated CpG island recovery assay (MIRA) assisted microarray to determine the DNA methylation profiles in both diploid and tetraploid cells.

DESIGN
First, we conducted a methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA). Briefly, we enriched for methylated CpG islands with methylated DNA binding proteins, MBD2/MBD3L1. The pulled down DNA fragments containing CpG islands and input DNA fragments were amplified with real-time PCR. After labeling, they were hybridized to CpG island promoter array. Data were collected and analyzed.
