TITLE
Expression data from Rb family (Rb, p130 and p107) deficient Hematopoietic stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Rb family in HSCs results in a severe phenotype, such as enhanced proliferation and increase in stem cell number. In addition, HSCs were higly mobilized but failed to transplant. Rb family deficient mice rapidly exhibit a myeloproliferative disease with eosinophilic characteristics. Meanwhile, the lymphoid compartment was severely decreased, due to high apoptotic activity in this lineage. Keywords: unpaired WT versus Rb family deficient KLS
