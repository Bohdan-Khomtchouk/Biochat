TITLE
Gene expression in aerial parts of rice-Arabidopsis Os-LBD37 FOX plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Aerial parts of the rice-Arabidopsis FOX (Full-length cDNA overexpressor) lines K16331 and K19624 harboring the rice FL cDNA of LBD37 (Os-LBD37) were analyzed. LBD37 belongs to the plant- specific LOB- (Lateral Organ Boundary) domain family proteins first characterized in Arabidopsis. Results point towards an involvement of the rice LBD37 ortholog of Arabidopsis in nitrogen metabolism- related processes.

DESIGN
K16331 (T2) and empty vector control plants (T2) were grown for 18 days on solid MS- medium supplemented with 20mg/l Hygromycin. For each hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, 2 independent plants for K16331 were used. Homozygote K19624 (T3) and empty vector control plants (T3) were grown for 18 days on solid MS- medium. For each hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, 1 plant was used.
