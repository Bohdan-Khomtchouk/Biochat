TITLE
Transcript profiling of WT and Nxf2 KO post-natal day 21 testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In euakryotes, mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytsoplasm. NXF2 is highly expressed in the mouse male germ cells.  We are interested in its function in spermatogenesis, espically in the nuclear RNA export in the testis. To this end, we made Nxf2 mutant mice by gene targeting. In an attempt to identify the mRNA substrates of NXF2, we perform the microarray experiments on testes. We used microarrays to check the expression profiles of the Nxf2 WT and KO 21d testes on C57BL/6 background.
