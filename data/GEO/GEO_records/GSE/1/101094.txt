TITLE
LncRNA/mRNA expression  in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and mached non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the lncRNA and mRNA expression profile in PDAC and matched non-tumor tissues, we uesed lncRNA microArray analysis form Arraystar to examine the expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs in PDAC and matched non-tumor tissues.

DESIGN
human tissues from PDAC surgery were distributed into two experimental groups: tumor tissue group and matched non-tumor tissues group, then perform lncRNAs chips by Arraystar Human lncRNAs chip (Arraystar)
