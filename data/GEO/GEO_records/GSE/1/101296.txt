TITLE
Arabidopsis inflorescence stems: wild type vs sgr1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wild type and sgr1 of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. Candidate genes which were down-regulated in sgr1 relative to wild type were identified.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 2 replicates for each experiments and dye swapped for each sample
