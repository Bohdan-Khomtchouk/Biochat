TITLE
Expression from C. elegans L4 animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Nutrient-driven O-GlcNAcylation of key components of the transcription machinery may epigenetically modulate gene expression in metazoans. Knockouts of the O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes in C. elegans are viable and fertile, allowing a global analysis of the impact of GlcNAcylation. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of the O-GlcNAc cycling mutants confirmed dramatic deregulation of genes in these key pathways. As predicted, the O-GlcNAc cycling mutants show phenotypically altered lifespan and susceptibility to UV stress.

DESIGN
Similarly aged L4 animals (20) staged by degree of vulval development were hand picked.  Wild type and mutant animals were collected and total RNA isolated for gene expression analysis
