TITLE
Ctr9 Promoter Region Binding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of Paf1C in mouse ESCs, we generated an ES cell line stably expressing a location and affinity purification (LAP)-tagged Ctr9 fusiuon protein using the bacterial astificial chromosome (BAC)-based TransgeneOmics approach. To investigate whether pluripotency and lineage control genes differentially regulated upon Paf1C depletion are direct targets of the Paf1C, we analyzed the binding of the Ctr9-LAP fusion protein by ChIP-chip and identified 2175 promoter regions that were bound by Ctr9. The supplementary bed file contains promoter regions bound by Ctr9. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
GFP-tagged Ctr9 ChIPed with GFP vs. mock in  BAC-transgenic mouse ESCs.
