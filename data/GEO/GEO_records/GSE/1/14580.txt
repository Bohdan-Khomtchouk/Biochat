TITLE
Mucosal gene signatures to predict response to infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) with over 60% of patients responding to treatment and up to 30% reaching remission. The mechanism of resistance to anti-TNF-alpha is unknown. This study used colonic mucosal gene expression to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment in UC. Keywords: drug response
