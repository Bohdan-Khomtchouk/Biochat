TITLE
Sprouting process in potato tuber

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Dormant/sprouting bud or eye tissue was collected from field grown Russet Burbank tubers using melon baler. These tubers after harvest washed with 5% Clorox, dried and stored at room temperature and allowed to sprout. Tissue samples were collected from dormant and sprouting eye at different physiological stages (based on length of the sprout) of sprouting. RNA was extracted using a hot phenol method and treated with DNAse. RNA extracted from different stages of sprouting potato tubers was used as query samples. RNA collected from non-sprouting eyes of potato tubers was used as reference samples  Information on RNA samples. Plant species: S. tuberosum CV Russet Burbank. Tissue harvested: Tissue was harvested from the dormant/sprouting bud/eye using ½ inch melon baler. Time points:  Dormant eyes –Stage 1 Initiating buds/sprouts – Stage 2 Sprouts (1/8 inch) – Stage 3 Sprouts (1/4 inch) – Stage 4 Sprout callus (1/4 inch) – Stage 5 Sprouts (1/2 inch) – Stage 6. Growth conditions: Field grown. Replicate information:  Biological replicates; A, B and C Keywords: Direct comparison
