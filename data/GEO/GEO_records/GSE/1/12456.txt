TITLE
Transcripts regulated by elevated DKF-2 (WT background)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was used to determine why DKF-2 (protein kinase D) deficiency and surfeit caused hypersensitivity and resistance, respectively, to a bacterial pathogen (P. aeruginosa 14). The studies show that DKF-2 contributes to C. elegans innate immunity by inducing expression of > 75 genes that protect against pathogenic bacteria. Keywords: Induced imune response
