TITLE
Exposure of Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma cell lines SKGT4 to deoxycholic acid (DCA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The involvment of bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) in gastro-esophageal reflux disease and subsequent Barrett’s metaplsia has been postulated. This study examines gene expression induced by exposure to DCA in esophageal cells and may be utilised in cross-comparisons with data derived from gene expression studies of Barrett’s esophagus and associated adenocarcinoma.
