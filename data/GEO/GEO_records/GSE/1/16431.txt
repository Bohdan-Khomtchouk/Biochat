TITLE
Methylketone Biosynthesis in Tomato F2 Segregant Populations

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Genetic analysis of interspecific populations derived from crosses between the wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites f glabratum, which synthesizes and accumulates insecticidal methylketones (MKs) such as 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone in glandular trichomes, and Solanum lycopersicum (cultivated tomato), which does not, demonstrated that MK metabolism in the wild species can be attributed to several loci. Comparative trascriptome analysis of the glandular trichomes of F2 segregants bulked into low- and high-MK plants identified several genes whose transcripts were either more or less abundant in the high-MK plants.
