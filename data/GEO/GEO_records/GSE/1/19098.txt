TITLE
Expression data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a function of cell adhesion and VEGF exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis is tightly regulated by both soluble growth factors and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM).  While cell adhesion via integrins has been shown to be required for growth factor signaling and downstream angiogenesis, the effects of quantitative changes in cell adhesion and spreading against the ECM remain less clear. Examining changes in global gene expression in limited versus high adhesion contexts in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we demonstrated a VEGF-induced upregulation of genes associated with vascular invasion and remodeling when cell adhesion was restricted, whereas cells on highly adhesive surfaces upregulated genes associated with a proliferative response.

DESIGN
HUVECs were cultured on micropatterned islands of fibronectin or allowed to spread fully for 2 hrs and then stimulated with 50ng/ml VEGF or no growth factor for 18 hrs in starve media.  Sample RNA from three biological replicates was extracted and prepared for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
