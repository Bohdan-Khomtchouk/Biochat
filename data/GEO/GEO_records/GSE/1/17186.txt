TITLE
Human B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goals/objectives: to identify various gene expression in B cell subsets derived from human PBMC and cord blood

DESIGN
Sample: human PBMC and human cord blood Cell subsets: memory B cell (CD20+CD10-CD27+), naive B cell (CD20+CD10-CD27-), CD21lo transitional B cell (CD20+CD10+CD27-CD21lo), CD21hi transitional B cell (CD20+CD10+CD27-CD21hi) Number of sample: PBMC (pooled from 2 donors), cord blood (pooled from 2-3 donors) Number of repeats: 2 Microarray: Affymetrix HU133Plus2 RNA extraction: Trizol (Invitrogen) RNA preparation/hybridization: All according to affymetrix protocol
