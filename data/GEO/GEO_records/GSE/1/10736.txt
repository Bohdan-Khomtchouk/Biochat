TITLE
Exon and junction microarrays detect widespread mouse strain- and sex-bias expression differences

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
71 liver RNA samples from three mouse strains - DBA/2J, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ - were profiled using a custom-designed microarray monitoring exon and exon-junction expression of 1,020 genes representing 9,406 exons.  Gene expression was calculated via two different methods, using the 3'-most exon probe ( " 3' gene expression profiling " ) and using all probes associated with the gene ( " whole-transcript gene expression profiling " ), while exon expression was determined using exon probes and flanking junction probes that spanned across the neighboring exons( " exon expression profiling " ).  Widespread strain and sex influences were detected using a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) regardless of the profiling method used.  However, over 90% of the genes identified in 3' gene expression profiling or whole transcript profiling were identified in exon profiling, along with 75% and 38% more genes, respectively, showing evidence of differential isoform expression. Overall, 55% and 32% of genes, respectively, exhibited strain- and sex-bias differential gene or exon expression. Keywords: Grouped
