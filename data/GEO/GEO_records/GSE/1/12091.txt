TITLE
Profiling gene expression in HeLa cells  by hsa-mir-26b overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples from three biological replicates in which the hsa-mir-26b was overexpressed in HeLa cells  were profiled by gene expression. As negative control, we used total RNA samples from HeLa cells transfected with cel-mir-67 Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)
