TITLE
microRNA expression profiling in human medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A high throughput microRNA expression profiles was performed in human primary medulloblastoma specimens and relative controls to investigate microRNA involvement in medulloblastoma carcinogenesis. Medulloblastoma is an aggressive brain malignancy with high incidence in childhood. MicroRNA expression analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to identify candidate molecules playing an important role in a large number of malignancies. A high throughput microRNA expression profiles was performed in human primary medulloblastoma specimens and relative controls to investigate microRNA involvement in medulloblastoma carcinogenesis. Keywords: RT-PCR
