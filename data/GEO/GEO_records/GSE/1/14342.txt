TITLE
Combined gene expression and network analyses and the role of the RNAP II C-Terminal Domain in mitotic segregation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit in DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is essential for mRNA syntheses, coordinating an astounding array of protein-protein interactions. In yeast, mutations that separate established functional units of the CTD result in pleiotrophic effects, producing slow growth phenotypes and the accumulation of abnormally large cells.  In general, the downstream pathways for such CTD related phenotypes are uncharacterized and probably highly complex.  We also observed that a sizeable fraction of CTD mutants retain multiple buds on parent cells and are elongated relative to wild-type yeast.  FACScan analyses revealed a trend toward increased DNA content over multiple rounds of growth, indicating that insertions into the normal tandemly repeated CTD result in aneuploidy. To begin to address the role of the CTD in such complex changes in cell structure and behavior, we applied an integrated approach using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genome Database (SGD) and microarray data. We were able to identify candidate genetic networks that could explain chromosome missegregation and related phenotypic traits in CTD mutants. These networks provide links between CTD-associated proteins and kinetochore function, control of cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms, and expression of cell wall and membrane components.
