TITLE
Identification of genes responsive to ultrasound in human leukemia U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, the effects of non-thermal low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the gene expression in human lymphoma U937 cells were investigated using by an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Six hours after LIPUS treatment (0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min), apoptosis (14±3.8%, mean±SD) with minimal cell lysis was observed. At 3 h post-treatment, LIPUS down-regulated 193 genes and up-regulated 201 genes by > 1.5-fold. Keywords: ultrasound, gene expression, Human lymphoma U937 cell
