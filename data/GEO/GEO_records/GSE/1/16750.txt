TITLE
Aortic gene expression profile of rats exposed in utero to maternal diabetes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Epidemiologic studies have clearly identified modifications of fetal environment as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases and of metabolic syndrome in adulthood. In our experimental model, rats exposed to maternal diabetes develop a volume-dependent hypertension as early as 6 month of age. In order to determine if the development of hypertension results from an abnormal vascular fetal programming, gene expression profile of thoracic aorta were studied in adult rats exposed in utero to maternal hyperglycemia.

DESIGN
10 samples total (including 5 dye swaps)
