TITLE
Whole-genome resequencing of T-DNA insertion lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Whole-genome resequencing of eight transcription factor mutants and one wild-type, in order to verify the T-DNA insertion site and its uniqueness.

DESIGN
Nextera whole-genome library and paired-end sequencing, to find the T-DNA insertion site(s)
