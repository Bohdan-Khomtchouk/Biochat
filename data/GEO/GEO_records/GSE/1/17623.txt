TITLE
The kinase TNIK is an essential activator of Wnt target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt signalling maintains the undifferentiated state of intestinal crypt/progenitor cells through the TCF4/ß-catenin activating transcriptional complex. In colorectal cancer, activating mutations in Wnt pathway components lead to inappropriate activation of the TCF4/ß-catenin transcriptional program and tumourigenesis in the gut epithelium. The mechanisms by which TCF4/ß-catenin activate key target genes are not well understood. Using a proteomics approach, we identified Tnik, a member of the Germinal centre kinase family, as a Tcf4 interactor in the proliferative crypts of mouse small intestine. Tnik is recruited to promoters of Wnt target genes in mouse crypts and in Ls174T colorectal cancer cells in a ß-catenin dependent manner. Depletion of TNIK and expression of TNIK kinase mutants abrogated TCF-LEF transcription, highlighting the essential role of the kinase activity in Wnt target gene activation. siRNA depletion of TNIK followed by expression array analysis demonstrated that TNIK is an essential and exclusive activator of Wnt induced transcriptional program. As an essential component in the TCF4/ß-catenin activator complex, the kinase TNIK may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells: Wnt3A vs control medium (CM) induction for 4, 7 and 9 hours; si-TNIK vs si-control after Wnt3A induction at 4 and 7 hours (2 biological replicates for 7 hour time point); dyeswap for each experiment (i.e. 12 arrays in total).
