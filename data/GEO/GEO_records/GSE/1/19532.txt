TITLE
Screening of genes involved in chromosome segregation in meiosis I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prophase I of male meiosis involves dynamic chromosome segregation processes during early spermatogenesis, including synapsis, meiotic recombination, and cohesion. Genetic defects in genes participating in these processes consistently cause reproduction failure in mice. To identify candidate genes responsible for infertility in humans, we performed expression profiling of mouse spermatogenic cells undergoing meiotic prophase I.
