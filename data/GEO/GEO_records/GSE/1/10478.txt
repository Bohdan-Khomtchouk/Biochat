TITLE
Curative and beta cell regenerative effects of alpha1 antitrypsin treatment in autoimmune diabetic NOD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed the gene expression analysis of the Normal, Diabetic and AAT treated NOD mice to elucidate the transcriptional changes induced by AAT. This will assist in identifying the biological processes / pathways involved in curative mechanism of AAT. Keywords: alpha1 antitrypsin treatment
