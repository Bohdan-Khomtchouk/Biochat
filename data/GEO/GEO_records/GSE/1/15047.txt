TITLE
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (expression analysis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (CNE1, CNE2, and HONE1) expression patterns against an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69.

DESIGN
This study was done to screen genes consensually overexpressed in NPC. NP69 was used as normal control. The microarray analyses were done in a same batch.
