TITLE
Yeast response to TFM exposure over time (YPD)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
This time course microarray experiment was performed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the global gene expression alterations due to 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) exposure  over time. In this experiment,  yeast grown in standard, glucose-containing media were treated with 0.05mM TFM over a four hour period.
