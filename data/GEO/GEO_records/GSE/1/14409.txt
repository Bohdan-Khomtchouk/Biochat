TITLE
Ago2 associated gene transcripts in two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to identify miRNA targets in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. By immunoprecipitation of wild type Ago2, it is expected to pull down the Ago2 associated gene transcripts. Through microarray analysis, the Ago2 associated gene transcripts identified are expected to be miRNA targets. Keywords: Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation - Gene Chip (RIP-Chip)
