TITLE
Expression profiling of joint tissue from C3H and interval specific congenic mouse lines post- B. burgdorferi infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of joint tissue from C3H and interval specific congenic mouse lines (ISCL) following infection with Borrelia burgdorferi Congenic lines of mice generated between C3H and C57BL/6 with penetrant arthritis severity phenotype were infected with B. burgdorferi Joint tissue was collected from uninfected control mice and from mice infected for 1 week, RNA was prepared and gene expressed analyzed by Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
Each sample was comprised of pooled RNA from at least 5 female mice of each genotype.
