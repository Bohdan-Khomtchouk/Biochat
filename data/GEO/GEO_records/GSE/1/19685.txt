TITLE
Identification of ploidy-regulated genes in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we analyzed the transcriptomes of isogenic haploid (MATa) and tetraploid (MATaaaa) budding yeast strains in the Sigma 1278b background and identified genes whose regulation was altered by ploidy.

DESIGN
Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from 2 biological replicates of haploid (MATa) and tetraploid (MATaaaa) strains.
