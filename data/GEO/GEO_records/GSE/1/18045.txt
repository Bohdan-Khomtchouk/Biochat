TITLE
Ovarian transcriptional profiles of four mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profiles of ovarian tissue from four laboratory mouse-inbred strains were obtained with NIA15K-cDNA microarrays and then correlated with the divergent spontaneous ovarian tumor rates and reproductive parameters reported for each strain.

DESIGN
Four test samples and one reference sample - common reference design- dye swap - 5 to 6 replicates per sample - test samples pooled from 4-6 animals , 23 arrays
