TITLE
Copy number variation and gene expression in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Copy number variation (CNV) of DNA segments has recently been identified as a major source of genetic diversity, but a more comprehensive understanding of the extent and phenotypic effect of this type of variation is only beginning to emerge. In this study we generated genome-wide expression data from 6 mouse tissues to investigate how CNVs influence gene expression. Keywords: genetic background, gene expression profiling
