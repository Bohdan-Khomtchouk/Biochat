TITLE
Expression analysis of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-gmd-fcl delta-fkp and B. fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-lfg

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-gmd-fcl delta-fkp mutant strain and a Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 delta-lfg mutant strain, each as compared to the wild-type strain. The mutations engineered into these strains interfere with B. fragilis protein glycosylation.
