The gene expression signature of genomic instability in breast cancer is an independent predictor of clinical outcome

SUMMARY
Recently, expression profiling of breast carcinomas has revealed gene signatures that predict clinical outcome, and discerned prognostically relevant breast cancer subtypes.  Measurement of the degree of   genomic instability provides a very similar stratification of prognostic groups.  We therefore hypothesized that these features are linked.  We used gene expression profiling of 48 breast cancer specimens that   profoundly differed in their degree of genomic instability and identified a set of 12 genes that defines the two groups.  The biological and prognostic significance of this gene set was established through survival prediction in published datasets from patients with breast cancer.  Of note, the gene expression signatures that define specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets predicted genomic instability in our samples.  This remarkable congruence suggests a biological dependency of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome. Keywords: disease state analysis
