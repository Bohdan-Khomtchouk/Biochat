TITLE
Analysis of expression levels of genes on chromosome 19 in U937 cells expressing AML1/ETO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used ChIP-chip to identify the determinants of AML1/ETO binding on a contiguous DNA region (chromosome 19). In order to correlate transcription factor binding to gene expression, we evaluated expression levels of genes localized on chromosome 19 by expression tiling. Keywords: Gene expression
