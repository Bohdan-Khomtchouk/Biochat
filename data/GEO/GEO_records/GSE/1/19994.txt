TITLE
Identifying genetic profiles for functionally distinct clonal populations derived from the Detroit 562 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Single clones were isolated from the Detroit 562 cell line and implanted into NOD/SCID mice to determine whether clonal populations within one cell line had fuctionally distinct phenotypes, in the form of differing tumour initiating activity. From these data I found that different clonal populations had different tumour initiating activity, which lead to this investigation as to whether these functionally distinct populations were also genetically distinct.

DESIGN
The different clonal populations were grown to confluence in culture, then harvested, counted and placed in trizol.
