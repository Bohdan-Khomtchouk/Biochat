TITLE
Mouse ES cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ES cells had different gene expression level compared with that of the MEF cells. This difference gave the mouse ES cells unique characteristics which could then be compared with other species' ES cells or iPS cells like human ES cells and Rat iPS cells by the homologue genes comparison to show which species' ES cells or iPS cells were more competitive with the other.
