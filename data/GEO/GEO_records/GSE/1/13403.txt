SUMMARY
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a gram negative enteric bacterial pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic colitis and heamolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans and is the cause of bloody diarrhoea and acute renal failure in children. We have studied the transcriptional response of a colon cell line (CaCo2) to infection by EHEC and another closely related enteric pathogen Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and compared its response to a cervical cell line (Hela). We carried out microarray analysis on CaCo2 infected with EHEC O157H:7 EDL933 and EPEC E2348/69 at 4 hours of infection and analysis on Hela infected with EHEC also at 4 hours of infection
