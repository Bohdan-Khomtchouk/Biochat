TITLE
Effect of PCN on CAR and PXR regulated genes involved in circadian rhythm, drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis

SUMMARY
The nuclear receptor PXR (Pregnane X rreceptor) mediates the effects of pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) on gene transcription. The relative role of PXR and also CAR to the induction response by PCN was studied on cDNA arrays containing 320 (Steroltalk V2) genes (genes involved in cyrcadian rhythm, drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol synthesis/transport, heme synthesis). Samples from livers of wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/- knockout mice were tested after treatment with PCN for gene expression within the European Framework V program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results from these experiments show the complex role of PXR receptor in the expression of genes involved in cyrcadian rhythm, drug metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.
