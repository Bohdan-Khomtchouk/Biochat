affy_floral_rose-Study of floral initiation and recurrent blooming in rose

ORGANISM
Rosa

SUMMARY
affy_floralangers_rose - affy_floral_rose - - Which genes are induced during floral initiation? - Are the genes involved in floral initiation identical between our 3 genotypes? - Which genes are involved in the control of recurrent blooming in rose? - Which genes are diferentially expressed between buds that will become floral and buds that will remain vegetative?-This project aims to find in rose genes involved in flowering control (floral initiation and recurrent flowering). First, the floral initiation will be observed in 3 genotypes. Then we will check if same genes are regulated within genotypes for this process. Concerning recurrent blooming, we will compare flower bud versus vegetative buds in non-recurrent conditions and finally bud from non-recurrent and recurrent genotypes. Keywords: time course
