TITLE
Expression data from pulmonary metastases of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The understanding of metastatic spread is limited and molecular mechanisms causing particular characteristics of metastasis, like varying dormancy periods of Mets originating from the same primary tumor entity or the differing number of Mets in patients with the same primary tumor, are largely unknown. Knowing the molecular fundamentals of these phenomena would support the prognosis of patientsÂ´ outcome and facilitate the decision for an appropriate therapy regime. We analyzed the transcriptome-wide expression profiles of 20 pulmonary metastases of renal cell carcinoma in order to identify expression patterns associated with two important prognostic factors in RCC: the disease-free interval after nephrectomy (DFI) and the number of Mets per patient. Keywords: comparison of pulmonary metastases from patients with different clinical characteristics
