TITLE
A sequence motif within chromatin entry sites directs MSL establishment on the Drosophila X chromosome

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dosage compensation serves as a model for understanding how chromatin-modification enzymes are targeted to initiate and maintain gene regulation. In Drosophila, the MSL complex associates with active genes specifically on the male X chromosome to acetylate histone H4 at lysine 16, and increase expression of most X-linked genes approximately two-fold. To date, no DNA sequence has been discovered to explain the specificity of MSL binding. We previously hypothesized that sequence-specific targeting occurs at initiation or “chromatin entry sites”, but binding to the majority of sites is sequence-independent. Here we characterize more than 150 potential entry sites by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq and discover a common GA-rich MSL recognition element (MRE). The motif is only slightly enriched on the X chromosome (~2 fold), but this is doubled when considering its preferential location within or 3’ to active X-linked genes ( > 4 fold enrichment). When inserted on an autosome, a newly identified site can direct local MSL spreading to flanking active genes on the autosome. These results provide strong evidence for both sequence-dependent and -independent steps in MSL targeting of dosage compensation to the male X chromosome.
