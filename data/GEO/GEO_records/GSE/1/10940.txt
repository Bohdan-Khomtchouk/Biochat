TITLE
Logjam p24 mutant microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling experiments on tissues from Drosophila melanogaster adult females with a mutation in the p24 gene logjam (loj) to test the hypothesis that loss of loj function causes a transcriptional response characteristic of ER stress activation. Keywords: logjam mutant compared to control
