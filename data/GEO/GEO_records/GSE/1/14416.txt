SUMMARY
Interferon is effective at inducing complete remissions in patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), and evidence supports an immune mechanism. Here we show that the Type I Interferons (alpha and beta) regulate expression of the Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) in bcr-abl transformed cells and as shown previously for ICSBP, induce a vaccine-like immunoprotective effect in a murine model of bcr-abl induced leukemia. We identify the chemokines CCL6 and CCL9 as genes prominently induced by the Type I Interferons and ICSBP, and demonstrate that these immunomodulators are required for the immunoprotective effect of ICSBP expression. Insights into the role of these chemokines in the anti-leukemic response of interferons suggest new strategies for immunotherapy of CML.
