TITLE
ChIP-chip of MG1655 with antibody against E. coli RNAP beta subunit under various conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We integrated RNAP binding regions (RBRs) and mRNA transcript abundance to determine segments of contiguous transcription originating from promoter regions. To measure RBRs at a genome scale, we employed a ChIP-chip method to E. coli K-12 MG1655 grown in the presence or absence of rifampicin under multiple growth conditions using antibody against E. coli RNAP beta subunit.
