TITLE
siRNAs 15-29 nucleotides long with 100 percent hit to Cocksfoot streak virus

ORGANISM
Cocksfoot streak virus

SUMMARY
Cocksfoot grass (Dactylis glomerata) collected from Wytham, Oxford, UK, was tested for Cocksfoot streak virus infection. Small RNA of the grass was extracted and converted to DNA according to Ho, T., et al. (2008)  Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 368:433-7, with primers modified to contain 454 adapter nucleotide sequences. The DNA then passed quality control through Bioanalyzer and Nanodrop before sequenced by 454 Life Sciences. Keywords: siRNA
