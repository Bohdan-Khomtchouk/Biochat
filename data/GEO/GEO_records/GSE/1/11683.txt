TITLE
Expression analysis in a breast cancer metastasis model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study compares a cell line (MDA-MB-468GFP-LN) that aggressively metastasizes to lymph nodes to its parental line MDA-MB-468GFP.  Derivation of the lines is described in Vantyghem et al, Clinical & Experimental Metastasis (2005) 22: 351â€“361.  The goal here was to compare the gene expression profile of MDA-MB-468GFP-LN to MDA-MB-468GFP,  Compare differential expression to databases of genes known to be involved in either cancer stem cell identification or lymph node specific metastasis in large scale clinical studies, and to confirm genes by RT-PCR
