TITLE
Gene expression in rectal epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were recorded from rectal suction specimens of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, carrying the CF-specific D508 mutated CFTR-allele.  These profiles were compared with gene expression profiles from rectal suction specimens of non-CF subjects (control).
