TITLE
BCOR-regulated genes in human oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome (OFCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by teeth with extremely long roots (radiculomegaly), and craniofacial, eye and cardiac abnormalities. The mutation of the transcriptional co-repressor BCOR has been identified as being responsible for oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is isolated from the root apical papilla of an OFCD patient. Gene expression profiling is performed and compared between mutant MSCs and wild type MSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from normal MSCs (MSCWT) and mutant MSCs (MSCO).
