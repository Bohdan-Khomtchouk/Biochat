Blood Transcriptional Profiles in Human Active and Latent Tuberculosis

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series regroups different datasets (training set, test set, validation set, longitudinal set, separated cell set) to identify and characterise a specific transcriptional signature for patients with active TB, distinct from patients with latent TB and healthy controls. The training set dataset was used to identify a whole blood transcriptional signature for active TB patients in London, across a range of ethnicity. This signature was then validated in an independent cohort of patients, also recruited in London (the test set), and then further confirmed in an additional independent cohort recruited in Cape Town, South Africa (validation set), in order to confirm that the defined signature was present in both high (Cape Town, South Africa) and medium incidence regions (London, UK). The longitudinal dataset was then used to explore how successful TB treatment modifies this transcriptional signature. The separated cell set compares the transcriptional profiles in purified cell subsets (neutrophils, monocytes and T cells) to assess which cell types are contributing to the whole blood signature, and in what way. These studies may ultimately help to improve the diagnosis of active tuberculosis which normally relies on culture of the bacilli, which can take up to 6 weeks, and sometimes the bacilli cannot be obtained from sputum thus requiring invasive techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In some cases (30%) the bacill cannot be grown from sputum or BAL. Any diagnostic tool would need to be valid across a range of ethnicities, and be valid in both high and low incidence countries. A further aim was to determine whether latent TB patients have a distinct homogeneous or heterogeneous signature, since it is not currently possible to determine using present tests (Tuberculin skin test - TST - or MTb antigen responsiveness of blood cells to produce IFN-gamma - IGRA assay) whether the mycobacteria have been cleared, are still present but are controlled by an active immune response, or to predict which patients will develop active TB. Defining heterogeneity in the latent TB patients would be an important step in developing diagnostics which could detect those most at risk of developing active TB, and thus enable targeted preventive therapy. The latter situation may be determined if Latent patients have a blood transcriptional signature similar to that in Active patients. The transcriptional signature in whole blood and cell subsets from Active TB patients may also provide information as to the factors leading to immunopathogenesis, thus possibly identifying therapeutic targets. The transcriptional profile in latent TB may give information regarding protective factors controlling the infection, important for vaccine development. Finally, definition of a transcriptional signature which responds to therapy could facilitate the development of surrogate biomarkers for drug or vaccine studies. Since any active TB signature may reflect common inflammatory responses evoked during many diseases,  we also performed analysis of significance, comparing transcriptional profiles from patients with TB to those from patients with other bacterial and inflammatory diseases to identify a TB specific signature. The resulting signature was then tested against patients normalized to their own controls from 7 independent datasets: TB (Training and Validation Sets), Staphylococcus infection, Group A Streptococcus infection, Still's disease, and adult and pediatric SLE. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
