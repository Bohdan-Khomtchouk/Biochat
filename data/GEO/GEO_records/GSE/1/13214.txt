TITLE
Evaluation of gene expression profile in postmortem brain with Alzheimer´s disease-type neuropathological changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unravel the mechanisms underlying brain aging and Alzheimer´s disease (AD) has been difficult because of complexity of the networks that drive these aging-related changes. Analysis of the gene expression in the brain is a valuable tool to study the function of the brain under normal and pathological conditions. Gene microarray technology allows massively parallel analysis of most genes expressed in a tissue, and therefore is an important research tool that potentially can provide the investigative power needed to address the complexity of brain aging and neurodegenerative processes. One of the reasons that account for the resistance of AD pathogenesis to analysis is that clinically normal subjects may exhibit considerable AD pathology, blurring criteria for distinguishing subjects with normal aging or AD. Here, we analyzed hippocampal and cortex frontal gene expression from 32 subjects separated in individuals presenting, 1) both pathologic and clinical AD (definitive AD); 2) AD pathology and normal clinic (pathologic AD); 3) cognitive impairment, without AD pathology (others dementias); and 4) no cognitive impairment, without AD pathology (normal individuals). Our results show that based on gene expression profile these individuals we could verify similarity between the definitive AD group and the group that only had AD-type pathology (pathologic AD).
