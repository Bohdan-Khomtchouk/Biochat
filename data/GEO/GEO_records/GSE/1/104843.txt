SUMMARY
To gain an insight into the changes between CTX-positive and -negative strain, apart from the CTX phage deletion, we carried out microarray analysis and whole genome sequencing of both strains

DESIGN
Organism : Vibrio cholerae, Agilent's V.cholerae GXP Expression  8x15k Array (AMADID: 022386) desined by Genotypic Technology, Bangalore
