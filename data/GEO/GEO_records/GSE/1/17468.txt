SUMMARY
Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2) are recently discovered epithelial-specific RNA-binding proteins that promote splicing of the epithelial variant of the FGFR2, ENAH, CD44, and CTNND1 transcripts.  To catalogue a larger set of splicing events under the regulation of the ESRPs, we profiled splicing changes induced by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ESRP1 and ESRP2 expression in a human epithelial cell line using the splicing-sensitive Affymetrix Exon ST1.0 Arrays.  Analysis of the microarray data using the previously described MADS tool resulted in the identification of over a hundred candidate ESRP-regulated splicing events.  We were able to independently validate 37 of these targets by RT-PCR.  The ESRP-regulated events encompass all known types of alternative splicing events.  Importantly, a number of these regulated splicing events occur in gene transcripts that encode proteins with well-described roles in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, cell-cell adhesion, cell polarity, and cell migration.  In sum, this work reveals a novel list of transcripts differentially spliced in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, implying that coordinated alternative splicing plays a critical role in determination of cell type identity.
