TITLE
Developmental gene expression profiles of the human pathogen Schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
The life cycle of schistosomes is complex, being characterised by a series of distinct parasitic and free-living phases involving an invertebrate snail host, water and a mammalian host. A custom designed oligonucleotide microarray was utilized to profile developmental gene expression in the Asian blood fluke, Schistosoma japonicum during these parasitic and free-living transitions. Total RNAs were isolated from lung schistosomula, juvenile females and males (paired but little or no egg production), adult males and females (paired with full scale egg production), eggs, miracidia, sporocysts and cercariae. We focused on the three distinct environmental phases of the lifecycle - aquatic/snail (eggs, miracidia, sporocysts, cercariae), juvenile (lung schistosomula and paired pre-egg laying adults) and adult (paired males and females, both examined separately) stages.
