ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a majoy health problem worldwide, specially in Southeast China. In order to find the new candidate genes and molecular markers that are associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), this study focused on the screening NPC relative genes by gene expression profile. Keywords: disease state analysis
