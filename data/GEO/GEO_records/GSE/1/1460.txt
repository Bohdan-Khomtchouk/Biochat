TITLE
Gene Expression Profile during human CD4+ T cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subpopulations of human fetal thymocyte and circulating na誰ve T cells were obtained through FACS sorting, including CD3-CD4+CD8- intrathymic T progenitor cells (ITTP), CD3intCD4+CD8+ " double positive " thymocytes (DP), CD3highCD4+CD8- " single positive " thymocytes (SP4), CD3+CD4+CD8-CD45RA+CD62L+ na誰ve T cells from cord blood (CB4+), and CD3+CD4+CD8-CD45RA+CD62L+ na誰ve T cells from adult blood (AB4+).
