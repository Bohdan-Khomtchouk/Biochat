Molecular evidence and gene expression profiles implicating involvement of Human Papilloma Virus in human retinoblastoma

SUMMARY
Bilateral retinoblastoma has served as a critical model for studying genetic predisposition to cancer, however international incidence of unilateral retinoblastoma is variable across populations suggesting the involvement of environmental factors. DNA from Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been found in human retinoblastoma tissue through polymerase chain reaction based methods in several independent reports. To search for HPV oncoproteins and characterize transcriptional profiles in retinoblastoma, we analyzed tumor tissue obtained after enucleation and cultured for one week from 13 previously untreated Mexican children with retinoblastoma.  We identified the presence of E7 HPV oncoproteins using western blot analysis in HPV positive tumors, and using non-supervised methods of classification on gene expression microarrays data, tumors clustered according to the presence or absence of HPV DNA identified by PCR. These methods were unable to discriminate retinoblastoma tissues by laterality. 2,404 genes were differentially expressed between HPV positive and HPV negative retinoblastoma, including a group of genes involved in a transcriptional response to viral infection. This molecular evidence supports the hypothesis that HPV is involved in the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.
