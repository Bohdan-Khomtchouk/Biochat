TITLE
Expression data from P2 mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zinc finger protein ZBTB20 plays a critical role in mouse hippocampal development by orchestrating gene expression profile of hippocampal neurons. We used microarrays to investigate the target gene of ZBTB20 in mouse hippocampal development.
