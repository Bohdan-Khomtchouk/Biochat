TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, pqsE and PQS

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa MvfR-dependent QS regulatory pathway controls the expression of key virulence genes; and is activated via the extracellular signals 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (PQS). Our findings reveal a multi-layered homeostatic regulation of PQS and HHQ and the MvfR regulon component PqsE which is a key mediator in orchestrating this homeostatic regulation.

DESIGN
We assessed the expression profile of pqsE mutant in contrast to constitutive expression of PqsE from PA14 and its mvfR mutant. In addition we tested the effect of addition of 20ug/ml PQS on mvfR mutant expressing PqsE
