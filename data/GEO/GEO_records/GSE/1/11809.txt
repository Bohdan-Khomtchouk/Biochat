TITLE
Lung transcriptome from M. avium infected WT, IFNg-/- and IRF1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium avium infection in mice induces granuloma necrosis in the lung which is dependent on IFNg. IRF1 is a transcription factor activated by IFNg signaling. The effect of IFNg and IRF1 on immunopathology and transcriptional changes in the lung were analysed using gene-deficient mice. The data from the Ifng-/- experiment have been described (Aly et al. 2007. J Pathol 212:295). Keywords: Infection, Genotype comparison
