TITLE
Identification of genes involved in CEACAM1-4S mediated lumen formation in a 3D model of mammary morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes involved in lumen formation: gene chip analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from both wild type and T457A,S459A mutated CEACAM1-4S transfected MCF7 cells grown in Matrigel
