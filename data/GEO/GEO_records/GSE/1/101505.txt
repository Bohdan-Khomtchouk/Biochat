TITLE
Arginine-dependent gene regulation in Streptococcus gordonii arcR regulator knockout

ORGANISM
Streptococcus gordonii

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that responses of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to arginine are co-ordinated by three paralogous regulators: ArcR, ArgR and AhrC. This set of experiments was designed to assess the effects of the ArcR gene regulator on global gene expression in Streptococcus gordonii under high arginine or following a shift to no arginine.
