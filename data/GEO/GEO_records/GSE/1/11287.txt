TITLE
Keap1-dependent gene expression determined in the liver using conditional Keap1 knockout mice vs. genetic control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare hepatic gene expression in conditional Keap1 knockout (Alb-Cre:Keap1(flox/-)) and genetic control mice. Disruption of Keap1-mediated repression of Nrf2 signaling was expected to result in increased expression of Nrf2-regulated genes. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
