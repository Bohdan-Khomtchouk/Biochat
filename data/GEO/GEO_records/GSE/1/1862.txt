TITLE
The search for enzymes responsible for metabolism of nucleoside analogs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix U95Av2 expression data from human intestinal cells (Caco-2) and tissues from all intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon).  Entries contain the search terms " glycosylase, phosphorylase, cytochrome or nucleoside, " which were relevant to our search for enzymes capable of cleaving the N-glycosidic bond of nucleoside analog drugs. Keywords = glycosylase Keywords = phosphorylase Keywords = nucleoside Keywords: parallel sample
