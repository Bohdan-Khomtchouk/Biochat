TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus delta crzA mutant upon 10 and 30 minutes treatment with CaCl2 (200 mM)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
CRZ is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor activated by calcineurin, a protein phosphatase activated by calcium-calmodulin, in different stress conditions related with calcium cell accumulation. CRZ binds to a specific element on the promoter region of genes called CDRE (calcineurin-dependent response element) shown to be sufficient for calcium- and calcineurin-dependent gene expression. In order to investigate which pathways are involved under calcium stress conditions, we determined the transcriptional profile of A. fumigatus delta crzA mutant strain upon a time course 200 mM calcium chloride treatment. Conidia from the mutant and wild type strains were incubated at 37Â°C in complete medium for 16 hours and were challenged with 200 mM calcium chloride for 10 and 30 minutes. At each time point, the mycelia were harvested by centrifugation and used for competitive microarray hybridizations. We were able to observe a decreased mRNA expression of genes encoding inorganic ion transport proteins and lipid transport. In contrast, increased mRNA expression was observed for several genes involved in transcription, energy production and conversion, cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning, amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism, nucleotide transport, cell wall and membrane biogenesis, posttranslation modifications, protein turnover, chaperones, inorganic ion transport, signal transduction mechanisms, intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport. Keywords: gene expression array-based (log2 ratio)
