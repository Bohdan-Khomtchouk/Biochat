TITLE
Expression analysis of the effect of protoplasting and FACS sorting in roots exposed to iron deficiency (-Fe)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to estimate the effects of protoplasting and FACS sorting procedures on -Fe regulated gene expression we generated expression profiles for whole roots that had been treated with -Fe for 24 hours and for roots that were protoplasted and FACS sorted after the initial 24 hour -Fe treatment. Little is known about how developmental cues affect the way cells interpret their environment.  Here we characterize the transcriptional response of different cell layers and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root to high salinity and find that transcriptional responses are highly constrained by developmental parameters.  These transcriptional changes lead to the differential regulation of specific biological functions in subsets of cell-layers, several of which correspond to observable physiological changes.  We show that known stress pathways primarily control semi-ubiquitous responses and use mutants that disrupt epidermal patterning to reveal cell-layer specific and inter-cell-layer effects.  By performing a similar analysis using iron-deprivation we identify common cell-type specific stress responses and environment-independent biological functions that define each cell type.
