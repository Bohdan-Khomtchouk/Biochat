TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of estrogen receptor binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The estrogen receptor is the master transcriptional regulator of breast cancer phenotype and the archetype of a molecular therapeutic target. We mapped all estrogen receptor and RNA polymerase II binding sites on a genome-wide scale, identifying the authentic cis binding sites and target genes, in breast cancer cells.  Combining this unique resource with gene expression data demonstrates distinct temporal mechanisms of estrogen-mediated gene regulation,particularly in the case of estrogen-suppressed genes.  Furthermore, this resource has allowed the identification of cis-regulatory sites in previously unexplored regions of the genome and the cooperating transcription factors underlying estrogen signaling in breast cancer. Keywords: estrogen effect, time course
