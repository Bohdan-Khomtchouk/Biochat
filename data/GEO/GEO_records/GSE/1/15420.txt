SUMMARY
Electroporation is a versatile method for in vitro or in vivo delivery of different molecules into cells. However, no study so far has analysed the effects of electric pulses used in electrochemotherapy (ECT pulses) or electric pulses used in electrogene therapy (EGT pulses) on malignant cells. We studied the effect of ECT and EGT pulses in human malignant melanoma cells in vitro in order to understand and predict possible effect of electric pulses on gene expression and their possible effect on cell behaviour. We used microarrays with 2698 different oligonucleotides to obtain expression profile of genes involved in apoptosis and development of cancer in a malignant melanoma cell line (SK-MEL28) exposed to ECT pulses and EGT pulses. Cells exposed to ECT pulses showed 68.8% average survival rate and 31.4% average survival rate in cells exposed to EGT pulses. Only seven common genes were found differentially expressed in cells 16 h after exposure to ECT and EGT pulses. We found that ECT and EGT pulses induce HSP70 stress response mechanism, repress histone protein H4, a major protein involved in chromatin assembly, and down-regulate components involved in protein synthesis. Our results show that electroporation does not significantly change expression profile of major tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes of cell cycle. Moreover, electroporation also does not changes the expression of genes involved in stability of DNA, supporting the current evidence that electroporation is a safe method that does not promote tumorigenesis. However, in spite of being considered an isothermal method it does to some extent induce stress that resulted in expression of environmental stress response mechanism, HSP70.
