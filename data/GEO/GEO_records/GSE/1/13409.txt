TITLE
Expression data of Naïve Treg and Tumor associated Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve Treg cells were purified from the resting spleens of FoxP3-GFP knock-in mice made in the 129/SvJ strain. Ascites Treg cells were tumor-associated FoxP3-GFP+ cells sorted from the tumor ascites of 129/SvJ mice IP-injected with 1 x 10e6 RMAS cells 5 days earlier; Spleen-T Treg cells were purified from the spleens of the same tumor-bearing mice. Keywords: in vivo samples
