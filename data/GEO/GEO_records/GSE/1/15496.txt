TITLE
MicroRNA expression in the newborn mouse cochlea and vestibule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit the translation of target mRNAs and affect, directly or indirectly, the expression of a large portion of the protein-coding genes. This study focuses on miRNAs that are expressed in the mouse cochlea and vestibule, the two inner ear compartments. To identify miRNAs that are expressed in the vertebrate developing inner ear, we used miRNA microarrays. Similar miRNA profiles were found in newborn (P0) mouse whole cochleae and vestibules. 105 miRNAs were found to be expressed in the whole P0 cochlea and 114 miRNAs expressed in the whole P0 vestibule with average intensities higher than twice the global background, out of 206 included in the arrays. Only 24 miRNAs were found to have different levels of expression in these whole organs, and these differences were mild (15-40%). The microarray results were intersected with two bioinformatic complementary approaches in order to choose candidate miRNAs that are predicted to be expressed specifically in the inner ear sensory epithelia (see the paper).
