TITLE
Gene expression of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;1 knock-out mutant rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice grown in paddy fields prefers to use ammonium ions as a major source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the conversion of ammonium ions to glutamine. In three cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 has the critical role for normal growth and grain filling. To understand a role of GS1;1, we performed transcriptional profiling of wild type Nipponbare and GS1;1 mutant plants in seedling using the Agilent Rice Oligo Microarray.
