TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by HIF-2alpha in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells within the bone marrow leads to reduced oxygen availability. In response to hypoxia, the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2α) is activated and stabilised. We hypothesise that activation of HIF-2α is a central driver of multiple myeloma disease progression, leading to the induction of transcription of genes associated with angiogenesis, osteoclast activation and cell migration. In this study we assessed the affects of HIF-2α overexpression on gene expression in the human myeloma cell line LP-1.

DESIGN
2 samples: LP-1 cell line stably overexpressing HIF-2α (LP-1-HIF2A) and empty vector control cells (LP-1-pRUF)
