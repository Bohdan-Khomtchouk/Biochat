TITLE
Response of Arabidopsis cell culture to phytoprostane A1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
12-Oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and several phytoprostanes are structurally related cyclopentenone oxylipins that can be formed via the enzymatic jasmonate pathway and a non-enzymatic, free radical-catalyzed pathway, respectively. To elucidate the biological activities of phytoprostanes in comparison to OPDA as well as the metabolism we performed genome-wide expression analysis. Keywords: mixotrophic Arabidopsis cell culture, ATH1 Chip
