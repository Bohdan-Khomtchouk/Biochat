TITLE
Aldosterone-Sensing Neurons in the NTS Exhibit State-Dependent Pacemaker Activity and Drive Sodium Appetite via Synergy with Angiotensin II Signaling.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell sequencing of Hsd11b2-expressing neurons in the NTS from mice fed standard chow or low sodium diet.

DESIGN
Single-cell RNA-seq was performed on Cre-dependent tdTomato+ cells that were manually isolated from dissociated NTS of Hsd11b2-Cre mice
