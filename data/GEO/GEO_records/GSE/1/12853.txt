TITLE
Serial hepatic gene expression profiling in Angus steers during feed restriction and realimentation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Growing ruminants maintained under dietary restriction for extended periods will exhibit compensatory growth when reverted to ad libitum feeding. This period of compensatory growth is associated with increased feed efficiency, lower basal energy requirements, and changes in circulating concentrations of metabolic hormones. To identify genetic mechanisms contributing to these physiological changes, 8 month-old steers were fed either ad libitum (control; n = 6) or 60-70% of intake of control animals (feed-restricted; n=6) for a period of 12 weeks. All steers were then fed ad libitum for the remaining 8 weeks of the experiment (realimentation period). Liver was biopsied from each animal at days -14, +1 and +14 relative to realimentation for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis by microarray hybridization.
