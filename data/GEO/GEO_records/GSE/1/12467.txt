TITLE
Differentially regulated genes in control and c-myc N-myc deficient LT-HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of HSCs from control and c-myc N-myc deficient long-term hematopoietic stem cells. HSCs lacking both c-myc and N-myc display increased apoptosis rates. Data provide insight into the molecular changes occuring upon complete loss of Myc activity, clarifying the resulting apoptotic mechanism and the role of Myc family proteins in HSCs.
