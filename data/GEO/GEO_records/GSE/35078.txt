TITLE
miR-221 is required for endothelial tip cell behaviors during vascular development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Through deep sequencing and functional screening in zebrafish, we find that miR-221 is essential for angiogenesis. miR-221 knockdown phenocopied defects associated with loss of the tip cell-expressed Flt4 receptor.  Furthermore, miR-221 was required for tip cell proliferation and migration, as well as tip cell potential in mosaic blood vessels.  miR-221 knockdown also prevented “hyper-angiogenesis” defects associated with Notch deficiency and miR-221 expression was inhibited by Notch signaling.  Finally, miR-221 promoted tip cell behavior through repression of two targets: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b (cdkn1b) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (pik3r1).  These results identify miR-221 as an important regulatory node through which tip cell migration and proliferation are controlled during angiogenesis.
