TITLE
Differentially expressed genes during pancreatic bud differentiation in cellular aggregates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of pathways altered by aggregation culture during differentiation from pancreatic progenitor cells into pancreatic bud cells. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the high-cell density culture induces specific signals to facilitate the differentiation into pancreatic bud cells. Results provide the differentially regulated pathways between the low-cell density cultures and the high-cell density cultures.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human ES cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells subjected to differentiate into pancreatic bud cells. The pancreatic progenitor cells were cultured at the low-cell density or in the cellular aggregates. Samples were obtained 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 days after culturing.
