TITLE
Expression profiling of over-expression of conspecific and heterspecific miR-310 cluster in Drosophila (cDNA array)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The miRNA 310-311-312-313 cluster from D. melanogaster (referred to as Dm310s) and the homolog from D. pseudoobscura (Dp310s) were used to transform D. melanogaster. The over-expression of UAS-miR310s in the Dm310s transgenic line M1-7 and Dp310s transgenic line P4-18 was driven by GAL4 line NP5941 with native miR-310 expression pattern. We used DGRC-1 cDNA arrays to assess the effects of miR310s over-expression on the whole transcriptome.

DESIGN
Direct two-colour design involving six arrays in three dye-swap pairs, with each pair used for the pairwise comparison of Dm310s, Dp310s and w1118 (control).
