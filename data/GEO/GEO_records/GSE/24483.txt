TITLE
TR heat-shock

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Within a GRO experiment, samples for Transcription rate (TR) analysis were taken at 0, 4, 11, 16, 26 and 40 minutes after heat stress (from 25ºC to 37ºC) and subjected to run-on. Analysis was done in filters also used for RA analysis of aliquots from the same cultures.

DESIGN
The analysis includes 3 repeats of stress treatment of the W3030-1a strain. The same times were used for sampling in each repeat of the experiment. A single genomic DNA hybridization on every one of the filters is used for normalization between gene probes.

PLATFORM
