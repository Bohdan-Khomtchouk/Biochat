TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblasts (ATCC, Lot 59501261) with knock-down of NET39, TMEM38A, TMEM214 and WFS1.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs) NET39/PPAPDC3, TMEM38A, TMEM214 and WFS1 are expressed or localise preferentially to the nuclear envelope in muscle cells. We knocked these proteins down using specific shRNAs and studied their effect in the diffentiation of the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 myoblasts at d0 and d6 post induction of differentiation by the addition of medium with 2% horse serum 48h post-confluency, replacing the medium every 48h up to 144h (6 days) post-induction. 1 ÂµM Tetrodotoxin was added to media 72 h post-induction. Control and NET knockdown myoblast cell lines were generated by transduction of shRNA-encoding lentiviruses targetting  the four NETs studied or a non-target shRNA. An additional 'untransduced' control was used to monitor for possible effects of the transduction protocol.
