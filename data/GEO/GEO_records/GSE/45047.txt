TITLE
Support of a bi-faceted role of ERβ in ERα-positive breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the basal and estrogen-induced effects on genome-wide transcription in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 after lentiviral transduction with ERβ.

DESIGN
Comparison of ERβ-transduced T47D and MCF7 cells versus respective control-transduced cells, in the presence of vehicle or estrogen. Each comparison in technical and biological duplicate.
