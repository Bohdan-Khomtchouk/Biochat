TITLE
Remodeling of DNA transcription genomic fabric in Capridine-treated LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Capridine is a chemotherapeutic agent with specificity towards prostate cancer and minimal bone marrow toxicity. Capridine structure is consistent with a classical DNA intercalating agent, although its DNA intercalation property does not fully correlate with its anti prostate cancer specific activity. We have used Agilent human gene expression arrays to identify the cellular targets of Capridine on androgen responsive LNCaP cells, a classical cell lines for prostate cancer studies. We found that expression of 142 unigenes genes was altered by Capridine. Interestingly, the most altered category was that of transcription regulators: 10 down and 16 upregulated. Our data confirm that, in addition to DNA intercalation, Capridine targets DNA transcription via histone modulation in a cell-specific manner.

DESIGN
Two-conditions: LO = not treated, LA = Capridine-treated DU145 cells. Four biological replicates of each condition. Differently labeled biological replicates were cohybridized with each array. Results of similarly labeled different conditions were compared then averaged for the two fluorescent labels. For instance: LO1 & LO3 were compared with LA1 & LA3, LO2 & LO4 were compared  with LA2 & + LA4, and the results of the comparisons averaged. This design uses 100% of the resources, has a better normlaiztion and allows all possible comparisons among the conditions.
