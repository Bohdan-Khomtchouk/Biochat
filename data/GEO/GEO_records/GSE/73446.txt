TITLE
Regulation of transcriptional elongation in pluripotency and cell differentiation by the PHD-finger protein Phf5a [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf5a regulates transcription elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), through regulation of the Paf1 complex. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression after shControl, shPhf5a, or shPaf1 knockdown in mouse ESCs following 72h knockdown and identified distinct down-regulated and up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs were transduced with pLKO.1-based backdone lentiviruses expressing shControl, shPhf5a or shPaf1 hairpins, respectively. Cells were selected with puromycin (2Î¼g/mL) for 72h. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
