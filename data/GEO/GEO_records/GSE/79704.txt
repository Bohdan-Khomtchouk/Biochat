SUMMARY
Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, debilitating, and often life-threatening inflammatory disease characterized by episodic infiltration of neutrophils into the skin, pustule development, and systemic inflammation, which can manifest in the presence or absence of chronic plaque psoriasis (PV). Current treatments are unsatisfactory thus a better understanding the pathogenesis of GPP is warranted. To assess the pathophysiological differences between GPP and PV we performed a gene expression study on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies of GPP (n=30) and PV (n=12) lesions and healthy control (n=20) skin. Compared with healthy skin, GPP lesions yielded 365 and PV 898 differentially expressed genes respectively, with 190 upregulated in both diseases. We detected higher expression of IL-1 and IL-36 cytokines in GPP lesions compared with PV, and this occurred proximal to neutrophils. We show both activated neutrophils and isolated neutrophil proteases can activate IL-36. Diverging from the Th1/Th17 pathophysiology of PV, significantly fewer IL23A, IL17A, IFNG, CXCL9, CXCL10 and MX1 transcripts were detected in GPP lesions. Our data indicate a level of sustained activation of IL-1 and IL-36 in GPP, inducing neutrophil chemokine expression, infiltration and pustule formation, suggesting that the IL-1 and IL-36 inflammatory axes are the main drivers of disease pathology in GPP.
