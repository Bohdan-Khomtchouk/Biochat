TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of normal and cancerous bladder tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways during cancerogenesis.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from malignant tumors were obtained from patients who had undergone surgery. Tissue samples from non-cancer controls were collected from autopsies of healthy donors killed in road  accidents. Both the tumors and normal tissues were evaluated by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the tumor cell numbers. All tumor samples used in this study contained at least 80% tumor cells. Tissue samples were immediately stabilized in RNAlater (Qiagen) and then stored at −80°C.
