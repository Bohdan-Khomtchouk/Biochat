TITLE
Expression data from mouse pancreatic cell lines treated with chromatin-targeting small molecules

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We measured the genome-wide expression changes induced by 29 compounds targeting HDACs, DNMTs, histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) in pancreatic α- and β-cell lines. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene-expression changes induced by chromatin-targeting compounds at 1, 6, and 24 hours.

DESIGN
To identify a comprehensive list of target genes that can be regulated by modulating the activities of chromatin-modifying enzymes, we measured the genome-wide transcriptional effects of 29 compounds in pancreatic alpha and beta cell lines at three time points. The results indicate that compounds cause similar effects independent of the cell line in which they were profiled. All clinical HDAC inhibitors fell into the structural classes of hydroxamic acids and ortho-amino anilides, respectively and up- and down-regulated hundreds of transcripts. In contrast, more selective compounds like the HKMT inhibitor BIX-01294 have specific effects.
