TITLE
Assessment of RNA samples from macrophages infected or non-infected with HIV to determine the effect of HIV infection on the gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously looked the differences in glyco genes using the CFG microarray in normal macrophages and T cells, in conjunction with our studies on effects of glycosylation on HIV/SIV infectivity. In the review of a submitted manuscript, the question arose on the effect of HIV infection on the gene expression.

DESIGN
To address this interesting question, we looked at RNA samples derived from macrophages (derived from the sample donor), either infected or not with HIV (in vitro) at different time points. RNA preparations of infected and un-infected Human macrophage at three different time points (5, 7, and 10 days)were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
