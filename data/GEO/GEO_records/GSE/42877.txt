Expression data from mice peritoneal cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sodium methyldithiocarbamate (SMD) is one of the most abundantly used conventional pesticides in the U.S.  At dosages relevant to occupational exposure, it causes major effects on the immune system in mice, including a decreased resistance to sepsis.  This lab has identified some of the mechanisms of action of this compound and some of the immunological parameters affected, but the global effects have not previously been assessed. We used microarrays to analyze the effect of SMD on lipopolysaccharide-induced mediators important in innate immunity and inflammation and reveal a broad effect on expression of transcription factors involved in Toll-like Receptors 4 (TLR4) signaling.

DESIGN
Female (C57Bl/6 x C3H F1) mice at 12-16 weeks old were housed in filter top shoebox cages with 5 mice per cage in a temperature (70-78°F) and humidity (40-60%) controlled environment. Then the mice were anesthetized with halothane and 50 µl of SMD solution was placed on the nares. SMD was administered by inhalation at (1) 100 mg/kg, (2) 200 mg/kg or (3) 300 mg/kg. 30 minutes after administering SMD the mice were challenged with ultra pure LPS from Salmonella minnesota at 60 µg/mouse (in PBS) intravenously in a tail vein.
