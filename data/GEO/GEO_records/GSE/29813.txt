TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinomas in B6C3F1 mice induced by Ginkgo biloba extract by gavage for two years

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and today is used as an herbal supplement for various indications such as improving neural function, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer effects. As part of the herbal supplement industry, these compounds are largely unregulated, and may be consumed in large concentrations over extended periods of time. This is of particular concern, because the long-term effects in terms of toxicity and carcinogenicity data is lacking for many herbal products, including GBE. The 2-year B6C3F1 mouse carcinogenicity bioassay indicated a marked dose-related increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development associated with exposure to GBE. We have shown that the mechanism of this increase in tumorigenesis is related to a marked increase in the incidence of β-catenin mutation, and report a novel mechanism of constitutive β-catenin activation through post-translational modification leading to constitutive Wnt signaling and unregulated growth signaling and oncogenesis. Furthermore, using global gene expression profiling, we show that GBE-induced HCC exhibit overrepresentation of gene categories associated with human cancer and HCC signaling including upregulation of relevant oncogenes and suppression of critical tumor suppressor genes, as well as chronic oxidative stress, a known inducer of calpain-mediated degradation and promoter of hepatocarcinogenesis in humans. These data provide a molecular mechanism to GBE-induced HCC in B6C3F1 mice that is relevant to human cancer, and provides relevant molecular data that will provide the groundwork for further risk assessment of unregulated compounds, including herbal supplements.

DESIGN
Six hepatocellular carcinomas induced by GBE, six spontaneous hepatocellular carcinomas, and six normal liver samples, three technical replicates each.
