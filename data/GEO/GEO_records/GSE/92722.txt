TITLE
Transcriptome of aerobically/anaerobically grown Actinobacillus succinogenes strain 130Z on fumarate/glucose

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus succinogenes 130Z

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of aerobically/anaerobically grown Actinobacillus succinogenes strain 130Z on fumarate/glucose

DESIGN
Four types of growth conditions, aerobic growth on glucose, anaerobic growth on glucose, aerobic growth on fumarate with glycerol and anaerobic growth on fumarate with glycerol, were used. In triplicate. Sequencing was performed with Illumina Miseq.
