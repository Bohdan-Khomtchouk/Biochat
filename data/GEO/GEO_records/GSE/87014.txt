TITLE
Identification of differentially methylated regions between leaves and young fruits of the apple GDDH13

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
The main objective of this analysis was to sequence the epigenome of the Apple (Malus domestica) doubled haploid 'Golden Delicious' tree. Our secondary objective was to identify differentially methylated regions between DNA purified from leaves and young fruits.

DESIGN
Three samples have been analyzed. Two samples were collected from pools of young fruits, and one sample was collected from leaves. After DNA purification,  Bisulfite treatment was applied to determine the cytosine methylation status. Illumina reads of the three libraries were generated using an Illumina Hiseq instrument. Differencialy methylated regions were computed according to Hagmann et al. 2015.
