TITLE
Expression of HCT116 cells transfected with CD44 siRNAs relative to that of HCT116 cells transfected with a control siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine whether depletion of CD44 might affect antioxidant gene expression in cancer cells, HCT116 cells were transfected with CD44 or control siRNAs and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. Although the CD44 siRNA was found to deplete the cells of CD44 mRNA, the expression of antioxidant genes was largely unaffected.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were transfected with CD44 or control siRNAs and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. Two replicates per siRNA.
