TITLE
Expression analysis of Reh cells after transfection with constitutively active variants of IRF5 (IRF5-4D) and/or constitutively active IKKβ(EE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of Reh cells following transfection with constitutively active IRF5-4D, constitutively active IKKβ(EE), or both in combination.

DESIGN
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays were hybridized to determine the gene expression profile of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived Reh cells following transfection with i) control constructs, ii), a constitutively active variant of IRF5 (IRF5-4D), iii) a constitutively active variant of the IkB kinase β (IKKβ(EE)), or iv) IRF5-4D in combination with IKKβ(EE). All hybridizations were done in biological duplicates.
