Identification and validation of NOL5A and RPS2 as potential therapeutic targtes in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification and validation of NOL5A and RPS2 as potential therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer using a functional genomics approach. To identify potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer, we first assessed the functional and molecular consequences of RNAi mediated silencing of candidate genes derived from previously performed gene expression analyses. We then generated gene expression signatures after RNAi against HMGA1, RRM2, TACSTD2, RPS2, and NOL5A.

DESIGN
To assess the consequences of silencing specific genes on global gene expression levels, triplicate transfections were independently performed. Cells for lyzed 48 hours or 72 hours after transfection (depending on the target gene), and total RNA was isolated for each transfection. For each sample, one array experiment was subsequently performed.
