TITLE
Widespread association between YAP/TAZ/TEAD and AP-1 at enhancers drives oncogenic growth [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify YAP/TAZ direct transcriptional targets and transcriptional partners, through ChIP-sequencing and gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of YAP, TAZ, TEAD4 and JUN in MDA-MB-231 cells. Two independent replicates were analysed for each TF, as well as for negative controls.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
