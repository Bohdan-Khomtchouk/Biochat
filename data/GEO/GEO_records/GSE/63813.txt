TITLE
RNA sequencing of allelic series of miR-17~92 mutant embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the generation of an allelic series of miR-17~92 mutant mice, each carrying the targeted deletion of specific miRNA families encoded by the cluster. We integrate the phenotypic characterization of these strains with RNA-seq analysis showing the consequences of selective miRNA inactivation on gene expression in the developing embryo.

DESIGN
We generated and analyzed RNA-seq data from 8 different miR-17~92 alleles, in three different microdissected tissues collected from E9.5 mouse embryos. Datasets contain biological triplicates (except for duplicates in one case, Delta_17_18_92) for a total of 71 samples.
