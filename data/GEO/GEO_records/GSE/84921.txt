TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human immature dendritic cells  and macrophages after 6h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus and platelet rich plasma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a whole-transcriptome study, cellular responses of DCs and macrophages confronted with the fungi A. fumigatus, platelet rich plasma (PRP) or the combination of A.fumigatus and PRP were investigated. Therefore DCs and macrophages of three independent donors were harvested after 6 hours co-culture with A. fumigatus, platelet rich plasma (PRP) or the  combination of A.fumigatus and PRP and analyzed with Affymetrix whole genome expression arrays. In general, transcriptomic analysis revealed a cell type dependent clustering. Only little effects were obeserved by addition of PRP. Furthermore a clustering of A.fumigatus stimulated cells whether PRP was present or not, was observed. However, significant differences in the immune response of A.fumigauts stimuled DC and macrophages were determined.

DESIGN
Human DCs and macrophages were generated from 3 independent, healthy blood donors. DCs/macrophages were either left untreated or co-cultivated  with Aspergillus fumigatus 46645 germ tubes (MOI 1), PRP (1:30) or the combination of  Aspergillus fumigatus 46645 germ tubes (MOI 1) + PRP (1:30) for 6h.
