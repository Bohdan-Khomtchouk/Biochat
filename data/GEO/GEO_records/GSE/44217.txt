TITLE
Mechanisms of Ikaros Tumor Suppression with HDAC1 through distinct histone markers in Pre-B ALL Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ikaros functions as a master regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and a tumor suppressor. Ikaros binds DNA and regulates gene expression by chromatin remodeling. Mechanisms of Ikaros-mediated tumor suppression are unknown. Here we examined genome-wide occupancy of Ikaros and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and  Histone midificaition markers in human leukemia, and found that the Ikaros and HDAC1 showed similar binding partern  and HDAC1â€“DNA interactions are associated with the presence of bivalent chromatin, and the recruitment of HDAC1 by Ikaros is associated with bivalent chromatin at Ikaros target genes.

DESIGN
Examine the genome-wide binding of Ikaros, HDAC1, H3K9me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 in Nalm6 ALL leukemia cells.
