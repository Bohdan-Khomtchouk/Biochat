TITLE
Global transcriptional machinery engineering in E. coli in the presence and absence of ethanol

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We measured transcriptional changes in an effort to understand mechanisms of action resulting from the introduction of global transcriptional machinery engineering in E. coli in the presence and absence of ethanol. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
We explored two types of experimental factors: genetic variation (mutated transcriptional machinery) and environmental variation (ethanol concentration).
