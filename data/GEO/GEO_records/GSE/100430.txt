TITLE
Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Clinical Efficacy of AMG 811, a Human Anti-Interferon-γ Antibody, in Patients With Discoid Lupus Erythematosus [blood]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study which sought to evaluate a single dose of AMG 811, an anti-IFNγ antibody, in patients with DLE. The patients in sequence 1 received AMG 811 followed by placebo, while those in sequence 2 received placebo followed by AMG 811. Pharmacodynamic end points included global transcriptional analyses of lesional and nonlesional skin, IFNγ blockade signature (IGBS) transcriptional scores in the skin and blood, keratinocyte IFNγ RNA scores, and serum levels of CXCL10 protein

DESIGN
Sixteen patients with DLE were enrolled in the study (9 in sequence 1 and 7 in sequence 2).  The patients in sequence 1 received AMG 811 (180mg) followed by placebo, while those in sequence 2 received placebo followed by AMG 811 (180 mg).  Blood draws were taken at D1 and multiple follow-up timepoints.
