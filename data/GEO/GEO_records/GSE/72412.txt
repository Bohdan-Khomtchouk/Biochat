TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile between human colorectal cancer SW480 and SW620 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two isogenic human colorectal cancer cell lines (primary SW480 cell line and its lymph node metastatic variant SW620 cell line),as an in vitro metastatic model. We have demonstrated that SW620 cell line possesses high metastasis potential  and  SW480 cell linepossesses low metastatic potential.

DESIGN
We want to compare the whole cell microRNAs profiles of two isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW620 cell line),  to gain an insight into the molecular events of colon cancer metastasis.
