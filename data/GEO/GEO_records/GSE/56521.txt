TITLE
Sex-specific gene expression profiles of Aedes aegypti 24 hr pupal heads

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Custom microarrays were used to examine global differences in female vs. male gene expression in the developing pupal head of the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the heads of male and female 24 hr pupae.  20 male or female heads were pooled for each of four replicates.  Hybridization experiments were performed on the Nimblegen Aedes aegypti 12-plex microarray design: 090305_Aedes_aegypti_TEfam_expr.ndf.  Four unique replicates and two repeat replicates were assessed in the hybridization experiment.
