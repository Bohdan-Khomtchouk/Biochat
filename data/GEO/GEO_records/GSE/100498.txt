TITLE
Characterization of small RNAs expressed in roots and galls from Arabidopsis thaliana induced by the plant parasitic nematodes Meloidogyne incognita

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
By sequencing small RNAs from uninfected Arabidopsis roots and from galls seven and 14 days post infection with Meloidogyne incognita, we sequenced by SOLiD technology the RNA fraction below 50nt. We identified 24 miRNAs differentially expressed in gall as putative regulators of gall development.

DESIGN
Uninfected Arabidopsis roots and galls seven and 14 days post infection with Meloidogyne incognita (3 replicates)
