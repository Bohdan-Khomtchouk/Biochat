TITLE
Identification of regulatory targets of the cereal VERNALIZATION1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Barley1 chip (GPL1340) was used to assay gene expression in RNA from barley seedlings, minus roots, at the 2-leaf stage. Expression was compared between plants carrying a VRN1-HA fusion construct (3 replicates) versus sibling null lines that lack the transgene.

DESIGN
6 samples, 3 replicates with transgene (b1-b3), 3 replicates of negative control line (a1-a3)

PLATFORM
GPL1340 [Barley1] Affymetrix Barley Genome Array
