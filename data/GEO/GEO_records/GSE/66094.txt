TITLE
Gene expression analysis to characterize similarities and differences in T. canis- or T. cati-induced neurotoxocarosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Larvae of Toxocara canis and T. cati show affinities to different tissues within the paratenic host. T. canis preferably migrates to the CNS whereat T. cati prefers muscle tissue. As both species share many characteristics like antigen fractions, reasons for this behaviour as well as underlying pathomechanisms or host reactions towards the respective parasite are unknown. Therefore, it was aimed to characterize the general pathogenesis as well as the respective host's reaction on the transcriptional level to identify similarities and differences between T. canis- and T. cati-infected brains.

DESIGN
Transcriptional changes in cerebra as well as cerebella of T. canis- and T. cati-infected C57Bl/6J mice were analysed 42 days post infection. In each infection group, 3 animals were included and 4 animals in the uninfected control.
