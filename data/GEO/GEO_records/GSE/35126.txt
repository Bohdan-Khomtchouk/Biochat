TITLE
Effects of Cardiac Glycosides on RNA Expression in Prostate Cancer LNCaP-abl Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and cardiac glycosides inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation. In order to investigate the mechanism by which cardiac glycosides inhibit  prostate cancer cells, we observed genome-wide RNA expression in prostate cancer LNCaP-abl cells, hormone resistant cells, after the cardiac glycoside treatment using RNA-Seq. In addition, we profiled LNCaP-abl cells after androgen receptor (AR) knockdown to observe whether cardiac glycoside effect on RNA expression is similar to that of  AR knockdown.

DESIGN
Observation of three cardioglycosides, Digoxin, Peruvoside and Strophanthidin,  and AR knockdown regulated RNA expression in LNCaP-abl with RNA-Seq (each triplicates)
