TITLE
Expression data for knockdown of H2ac in E2-treated MCF-7 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogens(E2) are important steroid hormones that regulate differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in hormone-dependent breast cancer.In order to detect the E2-dependent transcription program associated with the observed cell cycle response, we analyzed the effect of H2ac knockdown on MCF-7 gene expression using microarray. Interestingly, we noticed that 51% of the E2-upregulated genes are down-regulated by depletion of H2ac. The data also show that H2ac regulated E2-dependent genes through E2-induction signaling pathway.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cell line was transfected with scrambled or H2ac siRNA in the absence or persence of E2.
