TITLE
mRNA expression in SIDS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate gene expression in SIDS cases and controls, in order to uncover genes that are differentially expressed in the two groups. Tissue from brain, heart and liver from 15 SIDS cases and 15 controls were included in this study, and mRNA expression was determined using the Illumina whole genome gene expression DASL HT assay
