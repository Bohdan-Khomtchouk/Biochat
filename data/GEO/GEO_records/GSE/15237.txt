TITLE
Effect of imatinib on FIP1L1-PDGFRA-expressing EOL1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Eol1 cell line has been derived from a patient with chronic eosiniphilic leukemia. Eol1 cells express the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha oncogene. Inhibition of  FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha with imatinib mesylate (Glivec) blocks proliferation and survival of the cells. We performed microarray expression analysis to identify genes specifically regulated by FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha using imatinib-treated cells as baseline. The list of regulated genes was consistent with the activation of STAT trancription factors by FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Keywords: 4 hours treatment with Glivec

DESIGN
Eol1 cells were cultured in presence or absence of Glivec for 4 hours before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray.
