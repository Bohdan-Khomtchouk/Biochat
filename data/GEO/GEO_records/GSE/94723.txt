TITLE
Hormone-responsive organoid cultures of human endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effects of stimulation of human endometrial organoids with estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) In humans, the endometrium, the uterine mucosal lining, undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy.  We adapted conditions used to establish human adult stem cell-derived organoid cultures to generate 3D cultures of human endometrium. Unlike other mucosal epithelia, the endometrium responds dramatically to ovarian sex hormones, estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4), which regulate cyclical proliferation and differentiation of endometrial glands with concomitant dynamic temporal and spatial expression of their receptors, ERalpha and PR.

DESIGN
To mimic the response of the organoid cultures to hormones, we exposed them to E2 followed by P4 and performed a microarray analysis of organoids under the following conditions: ExM (control), E2 alone (E2)or E2 and P4 (E2P4).
