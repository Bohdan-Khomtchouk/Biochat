TITLE
Drosophila Imp iCLIP identifies an RNA assemblage co-ordinating F-actin formation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study, we employed a combination of RIP-seq and short- and long-wave iCLIP technologies to identify transcripts associated with cytoplasmic RNPs containing the RNA-binding protein Drosophila Imp. We also made a Imp knockdown vs luciferase control experiment.

DESIGN
Two biological iCLIP-seq, as well as two mRNAseq made on cells harvested on the same day. Two biological PAR-iCLIP-seq. Two biological RIP-seq, as well as two mRNAseq made on cells harvested on the same day.  Three biological mRNAseq of imp dsRNA treated cells as well as three control mRNAseq of cells treated with Luciferase dsRNA.
