TITLE
Genome-wide SNP Array Identification of Genetic Alterations in Cervical Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recurrent karyotypic abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cervical cancer (CC) cells, which may result in deregulated expression of important genes that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. To examine the role of genomic copy number alterations, we surveyed genetic lesions in CC utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. We identified specific genetic alterations associated with CC. These data will be useful in identification of target altered genes, novel markers for predicting high risk precancerous lesions to invasive cancer, comparison of copy number alterations with gene expression changes can provide gene targets for pharmacologic intervention. We demonstrate specific regions of gene amplification (e.g., 11q22), copy number gains (e.g., 3q, 5p, and 20q), and deletions (e.g., 2q, 11q23) in the present study, which forma a framework for identification of critical genes in CC tumorigenesis. Keywords: Cervical cancer, copy number alterations, HPV type, gene amplification
