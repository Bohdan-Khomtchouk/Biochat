TITLE
The role of photoreceptors in the light modulated cellulase gene expression in Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Light represents an important environmental cue, which exerts considerable influence on the metabolism of fungi. Studies with the biotechnological fungal workhorse Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) have revealed an interconnection between transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic enyzmes and the light response. The filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, has been used as a model organism to study light and circadian rhythm biology. We therefore investigated whether light also regulates transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic enzymes in N. crassa. We show that the N. crassa photoreceptor genes wc-1, wc-2 and vvd are involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression, indicating that this phenomenon is conserved among filamentous fungi. Genome wide analysis of photoreceptor mutants and evaluation of results by analysis of mutant strains identified several candidate genes likely to play a role in light modulated cellulase gene expression.

DESIGN
Three deletion strains (delta-wc-1 (FGSC 11712), delta-wc-2 (FGSC 11124) and delta-vvd (FGSC 11556)) and the wild type strain (FGSC 2489) at two different timepoints (28h or 40h) were analyzed. Cy3 and Cy5 dye swaps were performed.
