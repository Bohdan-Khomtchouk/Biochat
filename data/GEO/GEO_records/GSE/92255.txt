TITLE
ChIP-Seq experiment for the global regulators, CRP and Fis in early and mid exponential growth phases

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We have performed ChIP-Seq experiment for the global regulators, CRP and Fis in early and mid exponential growth phases respectively in Escherichia coli K12 MG1655. The dataset contains the genome wide binding patterns of Fis and CRP in the wildtype and the mutant strains

DESIGN
To understand the influence of global transcription regulators Fis and CRP on DNA binding property in different growth phases as well as of E. coli

PLATFORM
GPL15982 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655)
