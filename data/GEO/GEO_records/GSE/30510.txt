TITLE
Derivation of Rhesus Monkey Parthenogenetic Embryonic Stem Cells and its MicroRNA Signature

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We derived two novel rpESC lines and characterized their microRNA signature by Solexa deep sequencing. By characterizing their microRNA signature, we identified 91 novel microRNAs, except those are also detected in other primate ESCs. Moreover, these two novel rpESCs display a unique microRNA signature, comparing to their biparental counterpart ESCs.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different small RNA expression profilings in 2 rhesus parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell lines

PLATFORM
