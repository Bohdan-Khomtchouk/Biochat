TITLE
Dynamic responses by lymph node stromal cells to primary and secondary infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lymph nodes (LN) are constructed of intricate networks of endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells. These include the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC), lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and blood endothelial cells (BEC). We performed a comprehensive analysis of LSC responses to skin viral infection and found that LSC subsets responded robustly. Infection induced rapid transcriptional regulation of large numbers of both shared and unique genes in FRC, LEC and BEC to support LN remodeling and the immune response. This transcriptional program was transient, returning to homeostasis within one month of infection. Yet, expanded FRC networks persisted for greater than three months after infection. Our results reveal the complexity of LN stromal cell responses during infection and suggest that LN remodeling to acute infection supports successive immune responses.

DESIGN
46 samples were analyzed. 5 replicates of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC; gp38+ CD31-), 3 replicates of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC; gp38+ CD31+) and 4 replicates of blood endothelial cells (BEC; gp38- CD31+) were isolated from the brachial lymph nodes (bLN) of naive C57BL/6 mice. 4 replicates of FRC, 4 replicates of LEC and 4 replicates of BEC from the bLN of C57BL/6 infected on the skin with HSV KOS 3 days p.i. 4 replicates of FRC, 4 replicates of LEC and 4 replicates of BEC from the bLN of C57BL/6 infected on the skin with HSV KOS 6 days p.i. 4 replicates of FRC, 3 replicates of LEC and 3 replicates of BEC from the bLN of C57BL/6 infected on the skin with HSV KOS 30 days p.i.
