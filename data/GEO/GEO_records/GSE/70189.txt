TITLE
Human and mouse DRIP-seq and DRIPc-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study profiles RNA:DNA hybrid formation in human and mouse cell lines.

DESIGN
DRIPc-seq (strand-specific R-loop mapping) was performed on human NT2 cells and mouse 3T3 cells. DRIP-seq (R-loop mapping) was performed on human NT2 and K562 and mouse E14 and 3T3 cell lines. MethylC-seq and RNA-seq were performed on NT2.
