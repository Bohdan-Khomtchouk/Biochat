TITLE
Atrazine Induced Epigenetic Transgenerational Inheritance of Disease, Lean Phenotype and Sperm Epimutation Pathology Biomarkers

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study examined the potential transgenerational actions of the herbicide atrazine.  The F1 generation offspring (directly exposed as a fetus) derived from the F0 generation exposed gestating female rats did not develop disease, but weighed less compared to controls. The F2 generation (grand-offspring) was found to have increased frequency of testis disease, increased frequency of tumor development in males and females (predominately mammary tumors), early onset puberty in males, and decreased body weight in females compared to controls. The transgenerational F3 generation rats were found to have increased frequency of testis disease, early onset puberty in females, behavioral alterations and a lean phenotype in males and females involving a reduced adipocyte size, decreased body mass index (BMI) and reduced adiposity. The frequency of multiple diseases was significantly higher in the transgenerational F3 generation atrazine lineage males and females. The sperm differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs), termed epimutations, induced by atrazine were identified. A comparison of control versus atrazine lineage sperm identified 519 DMRs (p < 10-6) for the F1 generation, 431 DMR (p < 10-5) for the F2 generation, and 958 DMR (p < 10-9) for the transgenerational F3 generation sperm.

DESIGN
Outbred gestating female rats were transiently exposed to a vehicle control or atrazine. The F1 generation offspring were bred to generate the F2 generation and then the F2 generation bred to generate the F3 generation. The F1, F2 and F3 generation control and atrazine lineage rats were aged and various pathologies investigated. The male sperm were collected to investigate DNA methylation differences between the control and atrazine lineage sperm. MeDIP-seq was used to measure methylation in each sample.
