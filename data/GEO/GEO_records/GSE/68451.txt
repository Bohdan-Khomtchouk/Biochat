TITLE
MicroRNA data in the mouse liver at 48 hrs versus 0 hr post 70% partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs have been reported to control liver regeneration though the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in the mouse liver at 48 hrs versus 0 hr post 70% partial hepatectomy.

DESIGN
Mice livers at 48 hrs post partial hepatectomy (group PH-48h, n=4) and mice livers at 0 hr post partial hepatectomy (group PH-0h, n=4) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA 3.0.
