TITLE
PGC7 and TET3 ChIP-seq results

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC7 is a primordial germ cell (PGCs)-specific protein involved in epigenetic chromatin reprogramming in the zygote following fertilization. TET3 is a dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in epigenetic chromatin reprogramming in the zygote following fertilization.

DESIGN
PGC7 participates in protection of DNA methylation in the maternal pronucleus by preventing conversion of 5mC to 5hmC by TET3 oxidization subsequent DNA demethylation. Thus we tested the co-localization of PGC7 and TET3 in specific loci by ChIP-seq assays.
