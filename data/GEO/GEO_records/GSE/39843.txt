TITLE
Expression data of cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis airway cell lines under oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CF's physiopathology is poorly explained by the mutation alone. The oxydative stress could be a major factor of this illness . Study its impact on transcriptome's CF cell line could be ameliorate our understanding of the evolution of cystic fibrosis. we used microarray technology to evaluate  under oxydative stress,  the transcriptional state  of an epithelial lung cell issued from a human with cystic fibrosis and to identify a set of modulated genes associated to survival cell processes.

DESIGN
the two cell lines are cultivated to Air-liquid Interface for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each condition is triplicated. For the oxidative stress conditions, the two cell lines are treated on apical site by 15 µl of DMNQ (2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphtoquinone) ,concentrated at 15 µM, during 24 hours before RNA extraction.
