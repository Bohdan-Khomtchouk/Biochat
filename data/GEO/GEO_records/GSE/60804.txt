TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of SFRP4 contributes to epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression of imiquimod induced psoriasis-like mouse model, we have employed whole genome microarray as a discovery platform  to identify genes differentially expressed compared with wild type C57BL6 mouse exposed to the vehicle of imiquimod.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice at 6 to 8 weeks of age were applied to a daily topical dose of 62.5 mg of IMQ cream (5%) on the shaved back for 7 consecutive days. Control mice were treated with a same dose of vehicle cream.The total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
