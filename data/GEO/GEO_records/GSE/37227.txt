TITLE
Marker gene discovery for Staphylococcus epidermidis infection in zebrafish embryos (Agilent)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We use the zebrafish embryo model to study the innate immune response against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Therefore, we injected S. epidermidis (and three controls groups) into the yolk at 2 hpf and samples at mutiple timepoints. Gene expression profiles were obtained at 6, 30, 54, 78, 102 and 126 hpi by microarrays. The results show that the gram-positive bacterium S. epidermidis induces a late immune response with a strong response at 102 hpi.

DESIGN
This microarray study was designed to determine the gene expression profile during infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis. RNA was isolated from groups of embryos (20) at 6 timepoints during the infection. Wildtypes zebrafish embryos were micro-injected into the yolk (2hpf) with (1) 20 CFU of S. epidermdis O-47 mCherry bacteria suspended in PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone), (2)  mock-injected with PVP as a control, (3) Needle insertion as control, (4) Non-injected as a control. After injections embryos were transferred into fresh egg water and incubated at 28Â°C. At 8 hpf (6 h post infection), 32 hpf (30 h post infection), 56 hpf (54 h post infection),  80 hpf (78 h post infection),  104 hpf (102 h post infection) or  128 hpf (126 h post infection) twenty embryos per treatment group were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent.  All treatment groups were analyzed using a common reference approach.
