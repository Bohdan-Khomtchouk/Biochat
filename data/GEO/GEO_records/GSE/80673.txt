TITLE
Comprehensive transcriptomes of mouse pancreatic islet delta, beta, and alpha cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rodent models are widely used to study diabetes. Yet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of mouse islet physiology. We generated comprehensive transcriptomes of mouse delta, beta and alpha cells using two separate triple transgenic mouse models generated for this purpose. This enables systematic comparison across thousands of genes between the three major endocrine cell types of the islets of Langerhans whose principal hormones control nutrient homeostasis.

DESIGN
FACS purified delta or alpha cells and beta cells from the same islets. Islets were isolated from triple transgenic offspring of a cross between mIns1-H2b-mCherry (Jax # 028589) and either Sst-Cre (delta) or Gcg-cre (alpha) cells and a floxed YFP allele to label delta or alpha cells, respectively. Islets from replicate groups of 10 to 12 triple transgenic animals for each group were pooled by sex to obtain sufficient material. Pooled islets were dissociated, sorted and collect in Trizol for RNA isolation and library construction.
