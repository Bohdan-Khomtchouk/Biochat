TITLE
inDrop single cell RNA-seq of hematopoietic cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed morphogen-directed differentiation of human PSCs into HE followed by combinatorial screening of 26 candidate HSC-specifying TFs for the potential to promote hematopoietic engraftment in irradiated immune deficient murine hosts. We recovered seven TFs (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1, SPI1) that together were sufficient to convert HE into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that engraft primary and secondary murine recipients

DESIGN
Examination of  expression pattern in hematopoietic cells.
