TITLE
Non-Cell-Autonomous Tumor Suppressor Activity of the Homeobox Gene Cdx2 in the Gut

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset describe the transcriptomic profiling of cecum, stomach and ileum from wild type, cdx2 conditional knock out and cdx2 ; apc deficient mice, by mRNA-seq. Each condition was analyzed in triplicated experiment to analyze the role of cdx2 in colorectal cancer susceptibilities

DESIGN
Biological samples from dissected tissue were tested by RNASeq in triplicates resulting into a total of 24 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
