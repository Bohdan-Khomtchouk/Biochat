TITLE
VC109+111 mRNA levels in Wild-type versus ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Biological replicate of EV33+34. The two samples in this series are complementary hybridizations in a dye-swap analysis. Below is the normalized result of the paired dye swap samples VC109 and VC110. The ANOVA model of Kerr, Martin and Churchill (2000) was used to analyze the data from the dye-swap experiments, with terms included to account for gene, dye-by-gene, treatment-by-gene, and random error terms. To account for the number of hypothesis tests being made, and thus provide some level of error rate control, significance was assessed using a false discovery rate (FDR) controlling method. The step-up procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) was used to control the FDR below alpha = 0.01. For the purposes of this experiment, the hypotheses were assumed to be independent. Features found to be significantly enriched for DNA methylation after hypothesis-testing with a controlled error rate are flagged in the column. Standard errors and P-values are not available.
