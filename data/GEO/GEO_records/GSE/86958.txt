TITLE
Transcriptome of invasive mucinous adnocarcinoma of the lung and adjacent normal lung tissues from 6 patients based on RNA-seq method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes that are highly expressed in human IMA, we performed mRNA-seq analysis using RNAs extracted from 6 human invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung (IMA) and adjacent normal lung tissues and determined genes differentially expressed in human IMA.

DESIGN
RNA samples from invasive mucinous adnocarcinoma of the lung and adjacent normal lung tissues from the 6 patients were obtained, sequenced, and compared.
