TITLE
NSD3-NUT Fusion Oncoprotein in NUT Midline Carcinoma identified in 1221 patient-derived cell line by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discarded live tumor tissue from a metastatic focus in the patient’s lung was collected under institutional review board approval through the NUT midline carcinoma registry (www.NMCRegistry.org). From this tissue the first known NUT-variant cell line, 1221, was established. To determine the putative partner gene to NUT, we performed comprehensive RNA-sequencing on RNA purified from 1221. We identified an in-frame transcript fusing the 5’ coding sequence of NSD3 (exons 1-7) to exons 2-7 of NUT. Expression of the NSD3-NUT fusion oncoprotein was verified by immunobloting with an antibody to NUT, revealing an approximately 200kDa band that is similar in size to BRD3-NUT, but smaller than BRD4-NUT

DESIGN
Identification of a NUT fusion partner using RNA extracted from live cultured 1221 cell line derived from a lung metastasis from the index case of a 13 year old female with NUT-positive NMC.
