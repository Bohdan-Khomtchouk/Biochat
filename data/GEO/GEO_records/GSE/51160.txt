TITLE
Salmonella enterica subsp. Enteric sv. Typhimurium in vivo induced enterocyte transcriptional response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
1-day-old C57BL/6 mice were left untreated (co) or orally infected with 10E2 CFU wildtype (wt) or delta invC SPI1 mutant Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC14028). Four biological replicates obtained from individual animals were exmained; each group contained animals from at least 2 different litters. On day 4 p.i., animals were sacrificed and intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from total small intestine  (protocol according to: Lotz et al., J. Exp. Med. 2006). Total RNA was isolated by TriZol and its purity was examined using a Bioanalyzer. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in primary total isolated intestinal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of isolated intestinal epithelial cells obtained 4 daysp.i. from neonate mice infected at the age of 1 day (each group with animals from at least two litteres). Single color array.
