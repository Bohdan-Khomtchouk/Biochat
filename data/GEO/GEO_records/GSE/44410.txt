TITLE
Gene expression profile of splenic p14 effector T cells eight days after LCMV infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses was employed to determine the gene expression profiles of LCMV-specific p14 CD8+ effector T cells eight days after an acute LCMV Armstrong infection providing a framework to compare and contrast effector function potential of distinct immune cell subsets to CD8+ effector T cells.

DESIGN
Splenic CD90.1+ p14 effector T cells from congenic LCMV Armstrong-immune p14 chimeras were magnetically pre-enriched from individual p14 chimeras (n=3) 8 days after infection using an alpha-PE selection kit (EasySep, StemCell Technologies) and further purified by FACS-sorting of CD8+CD90.1+ cells (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences) achieving > 99% purity.
