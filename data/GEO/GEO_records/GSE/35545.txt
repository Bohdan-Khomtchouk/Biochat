TITLE
Fibroblasts under adipogenic, chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation medium and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis was performed to investigate the changes of the fibroblast phenotype after four-week inductions toward adipocytic, osteoblastic and chondrocytic lineages. Human cells. Differential gene regulation, interpreted through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, highlight important similarities and differences of induced fibroblasts compared to control cultures of human fibroblasts, adipocytes, osteoblasts and articular chondrocytes.

DESIGN
Fibroblast controls were compared to Adipogenic induced fibroblasts and adipocytes. Gene sets were analysed with GSEA (webgestalt). Repeated for each lineage.
