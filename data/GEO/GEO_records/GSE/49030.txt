TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of the activity-dependent hippocampal transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activity-dependent gene expression is central for sculpting neuronal connectivity in the brain. Despite the importance for synaptic plasticity, a comprehensive analysis of the temporal changes in the transcriptomic response to neuronal activity is lacking. In a genome wide survey we identified genes that were induced at 1, 4, 8, or 24 hours following neuronal activity in the hippocampus.

DESIGN
3 month old male mice were injected with kainic acid or isotonic saline solution. Animals were sacrificed by cervical luxation 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h after onset of the first seizure, and RNA  was extracted  from the hippocampal region.
