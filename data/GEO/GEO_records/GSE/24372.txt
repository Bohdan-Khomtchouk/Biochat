TITLE
Endogenous Muscle Atrophy F-box Regulates Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays a critical role in mediating skeletal muscle atrophy. We investigated the effect of MAFbx KO in cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. A DNA microarray analysis was conducted using total RNA prepared from wild type and MAFbx KO mouse hearts subject to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism to mediate the effect of MAFbx upon pathological hypertrophy.

DESIGN
We applied TAC to wild type and MAFbx KO mice, and extracted total RNA one week after the surgery. The gene expression profiles were examined by Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST Array.
