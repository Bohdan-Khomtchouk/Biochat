TITLE
MicroRNA expression from bronchial epithelial cell samples of current and never smokers.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression was assayed from bronchial epithelial cells collected via bronchoscopy from healthy current and never smoker volunteers in order to determine the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on airway epithelial microRNA expression Keywords: Global microRNA expression profiling
