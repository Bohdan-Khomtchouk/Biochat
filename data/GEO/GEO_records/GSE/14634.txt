TITLE
MicroRNA expression from bronchial epithelial cell samples of current and never smokers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression was assayed from bronchial epithelial cells collected via bronchoscopy from healthy current and never smoker volunteers in order to determine the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on airway epithelial microRNA expression Keywords: Global microRNA expression profiling

DESIGN
Bronchial epithelial cells were collected from current and never smokers via bronchoscopy. Low molecular weight RNA ( < 200 nucleotides) was isolated and hybridized to Invitrogen NCode microRNA microarrays to determine which microRNAs detected in bronchial epithelial cells were differentially expressed in the airways of smokers.
