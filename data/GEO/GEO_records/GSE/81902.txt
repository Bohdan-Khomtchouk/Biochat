TITLE
Bulk RNA-seq analysis of Type 5 retinal bipolar cells from the Htr3a-GFP line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
15,000 GFP+ cells were collected from two replicates of the Htr3a GFP line into RNAlater (ThermoFisher, AM7024). RNA was purified and bulk RNA-seq was performed using the Ovation RNA-seq system V2 (Nugen, 7102-32)

DESIGN
Bulk RNA-seq analysis of Type 5 retinal bipolar cells (2 biological replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
