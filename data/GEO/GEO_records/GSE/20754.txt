TITLE
Expression data from WT and TCF-1-deficient memory CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TCF-1 is an HMG family transcription factor which is known to be activated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and modulated by other signals such as those derived from T cell receptor. We found that during CD8 T cell responses, TCF-1 deficiency impaired long-term maintenance of antigen-specific memory CD8 T cells. We used microarrays to detect gene expression changes in memory CD8 T cells caused by TCF-1 deficiency.

DESIGN
Host mice that received WT or TCF-1-deficient OT-I CD8 T cells were infected with attenuated Listeria monocytogenes expressing Ova peptide. In memory phase (i.e., more than 80 days post infection), antigen-specific T cells were ioslated by cell sorting. RNA was extracted and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse GENE 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix).
