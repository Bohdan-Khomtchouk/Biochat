TITLE
RNA Seq analysis of e12.5 mouse pancreatic buds from control and Pdxcre; Gata4fl/fl;Gata6fl/fl; Tom mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
about 250 genes were significantly changed after Gata4 and Gata6 were specifically deleted in the pancreatic progenitor cells

DESIGN
6 pancreatic buds were pooled for the control, and 12 pancreatic buds were pooled for the Pdxcre; Gata4fl/fl; Gata6fl/fl. Libraries were prepared from total RNA (RIN > 8) with the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument. More than 20 million reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC/mm9) using Tophat (version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. Significantly differentially expressed genes were calculated using DEseq

PLATFORM
