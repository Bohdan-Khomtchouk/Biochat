TITLE
DNMT3b ChIP-Seq in enteric precursor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
With the aim to elucidate the mechanism underlying the DNMT3b role in such processes, we have performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis to identify the DNMT3B target genes in enteric precursor cells (EPCs) from mice.

DESIGN
Identification of DNMT3b target genes in enteric precursor cells. 12 ChIPs and 12 Inputs were sequenced and analyzed.
