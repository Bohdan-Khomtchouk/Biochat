TITLE
Impact of short-term high fat diet regimen on hepatic transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to unveil the gene expression alterations upon short-term HFD administration We found that short-term HFD administration impacts hepatic lipid biosynthesis and redox status

DESIGN
Pairwise comparison between  RD and HFD. 3 biological replicates of each condition were used.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
