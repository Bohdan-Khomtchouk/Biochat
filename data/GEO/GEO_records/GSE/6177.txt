TITLE
The effects of the sfr2, sfr3 and sfr6 mutations on lyotropic stress responses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our goals are to discover the basis of the stress-sensitive phenotypes of the sfr2, sfr3 and sfr6 mutants, and to distinguish damage-repair from damage-prevention-related transcription in the wild type. The effects of sfr2 and sfr3 on cold-induced gene expression will be observed. Since sfr6 causes sensitivity to drought as well as freezing, the effects of sfr6 on the transcriptional response to drought is studied; an observation of cold-induced sfr6 expression is needed for direct comparison to the effect of drought. Unstressed mutants, and equivalently-stressed wild types, are necessary controls. The above experiments are conducted on tissue-culture-grown plants grown under 24 hr illumination for maximum reproducibility and comparability to other transcriptomic experiments.Freezing causes physiological changes even in a hardy, cold-acclimated wild type. During the recovery period, gene expression will reflect the induction of damage-repair processes distinct from the damage-prevention associated with cold acclimation. This will be detected by observing the wild-type transcriptome at two time points during recovery from a freezing episode. The appropriate controls is the unfrozen, cold-acclimated wild type. Plants for this experiment will be soil-grown in an 9/15 day/night cycle to the rosette stage, and this regime will be maintained during acclimation and freezing treatments.Cold-induction will be 10 days at 4Â°C; drought will be imposed by placing excised leaves in a desiccator for 6 h. The youngest fully-expanded rosette leaves will be harvested for RNA extraction. Keywords: stimulus_or_stress_design; strain_or_line_design; time_series_design
