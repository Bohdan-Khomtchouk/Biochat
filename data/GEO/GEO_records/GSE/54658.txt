TITLE
mRNA profiling of AGS Gastric Cancer cell line treated with the Homeopathy formulation, Ornithogalum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ornithogalum is one of the therapeutic formulation used in homeopathic treatments. It is specifically used in the treatment for gastric and duodenal ulcerations. Towards understanding the anticancer mechanism, we investigated the genome-wide mRNA changes upon treating AGS Gastric Cancer cells with Ornithogalum. We observed that totally 707 genes were significantly regulated upon Ornithogalum Treatment, among them 246 genes were upregulated and 461 genes were downregulated. The results provide insight into molecular implication and gene level expression of  AGS upon treatment with Ornithogalum.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from AGS gastric cancer cells treated with 0.01% of ornithogalum and ethanol control and profiled using  Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (HuGene-1_0-st).
