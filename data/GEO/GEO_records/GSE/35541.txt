TITLE
Effect of ribosomal protein intron deletion on gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ribosomal proteins are essential to life. While the functions of ribosomal protein-encoding genes (RPGs) are highly conserved, the evolution of their regulatory mechanisms is remarkably dynamic. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RPGs are unusual in that they are commonly present as two highly similar gene copies and that they are over-represented among intron-containing genes. To investigate the role of introns in the regulation of RPG expression, we constructed 16 S. cerevisiae strains with precise deletions of RPG introns. We found that several yeast introns function to repress rather than to increase steady-state mRNA levels. Among these, the RPS9A and RPS9B introns were required for cross-regulation of the two paralogous gene copies, which is consistent with the duplication of an autoregulatory circuit.

DESIGN
Splicing specific microarrays were used to assess the genome-wide defects in gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing that result from a deletion of a single ribosomal protein gene intron.
