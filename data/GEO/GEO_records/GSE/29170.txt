TITLE
Androgen regulation of genes in rat forebrain, prostate, ovary, and skin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify androgen regulated genes in the forebrain, prostate, ovary, and skin. The results of this study will be used to make comparisons between androgen regulation of gene expression in different androgen-receptor expressing tissues, and will contribute to our understanding of tissue-selective androgen activity.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from tissues castrate male rodents after 16 hours of treatment of either vehicle (Ctrl) or DHT.  The 4 tissues of extraction are Forebrain (ForeB.Ctrl & ForeB.DHT), Ovary (Ovary.Ctrl & Ovary.DHT), Prostate (Prost.Ctrl & Prost.DHT), and Skin (Skin.Ctrl & Skin.DHT).  There are 3 biological replicates per group for a total of 24 samples.
