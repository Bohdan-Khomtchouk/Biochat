TITLE
Program specificity for Ptf1a in Pancreas versus Neural Tube Development correlates with distinct collaborating cofactors and chromatin accessibility

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ptf1a is a lineage-specific basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical in the development of both the pancreas and nervous system. How one transcription factor controls diverse programs of gene expression is a fundamental question in developmental biology. To uncover molecular strategies for the program-specific functions of Ptf1a, we identified bound genomic regions in vivo during development of both tissues. A majority of regions bound by Ptf1a are tissue-specific, lie near genes needed for proper formation and maturation of each tissue, and reflect regions of open chromatin.  Information for the specificity of Ptf1a binding and function is encoded in the DNA surrounding the Ptf1a-bound sites, since Ptf1a-bound regions are sufficient to direct tissue-restricted reporter expression when tested in transgenic mice. Fox and Sox factors were identified as lineage specific modifiers of Ptf1a binding, since binding motifs for these factors are enriched in Ptf1a-bound regions in pancreas and neural tube, respectively. Although Ptf1a and Foxa2 co-localize to sites in embryonic pancreas and can act synergistically in cell transfection assays, biochemical experiments detected no physical interaction between the two factors. These findings indicate that lineage-specific chromatin landscapes likely constrain the functions of Ptf1a, and identify Fox and Sox gene families as part of this process.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq: Examination of gene expression in Ptf1a expressing cells (NT E.12.5, Pancreas E15.5) ChIP-Seq: Examination of chromatin occupancy in 2 tissue types (E12.5 NT and 17.5 Pancreas). Faire-Seq: Examination of open chromatin in 2 tissue types (E12.5 NT and 17.5 Pancreas).
