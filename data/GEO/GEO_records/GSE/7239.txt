TITLE
ArrayCGH experiments involving patients with T-ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We consider a data set consisting out of 27 arrayCGH dye-swap experiments (54 arrays) of individuals with T-ALL versus normal individuals. Aim was to detect novel unbalanced genomic rearrangements in T-ALL. Analysis of the patients was done using an array with genomic BAC and PAC probes with an overall resolution of 1Mb over the entire genome and with additional probes around known and candidate oncogenes. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization, genotype

DESIGN
27 dye-swap experiments of patient samples versus normal, reference samples.
