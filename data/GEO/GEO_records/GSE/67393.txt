TITLE
Sex differences of leukocytes DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Samples included  63 of male samples,and 54 of female samples from peripheral leukocytes. All samples were healthy controls.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 117 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. Samples 1-93 were used in a pilot experiment and Samples 101-124 were used in a replicated experiment.
