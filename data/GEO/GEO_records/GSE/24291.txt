TITLE
Expression data from differentiating ES cells expressing Snail during Wnt inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ES cells differentiated in the presence of the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 fail to express the transcription factor Snail and undergo EMT.  We generated an ES cell line, A2.snail, that induced Snail expression upon addition of doxycycline addition. Microarrays were used to gain a global picture of ES cell differentiation at early timepoints after Snail was expressed during Wnt inhibition.

DESIGN
A2.snail ES cells, which express Snail upon addition of doxycycline, were differentiated as embryoid bodies in differentiation media and DKK1.  Total RNA was harvested from control (no doxycycline) and Snail-induced (doxycycline at day 2) cultures at 6, 12, and 24 hours after doxycycline addition (corresponding to days 2.25, 2.5, and 3 of differentiation).
