TITLE
Pilot screen for human PRC1 targeting elements (PTEs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PcG proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of development. Here we compared genomic distributions of MEL18 and SUZ12 in NTERA-2 cells to search for sites with unusually high presence of PRC1 compared to that of PRC2 and H3K27me3.

DESIGN
ChIPs of MEL18 and SUZ12 proteins coupled to next-generation sequencing from chromatin of human NTERA-2 cultured cells. Done in single replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
