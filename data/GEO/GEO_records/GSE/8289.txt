TITLE
HEK293 cells overexpressing HNF4a2 wild type or mutant forms C106R or R154X

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes regulated by the transcription factor HNF4a2 Keywords: ordered

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify genes regulated by the transcription factor HNF4a2. HEK293 cell lines containing doxycyclin-inducible wilt type or mutant forms of HNF4a2m which were introduced by FRT/FLP mediated recombination into FLP-In T-REx 293 cells (Invitrogen) were treated for 24 hours with 1 Âµg/ml doxycyclin. Gene expression profiles of induced and noninduced cells were compared to identify HNF4 regulated targets.
