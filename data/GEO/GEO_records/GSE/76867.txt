TITLE
Characterization of microRNA Expression Profiles in Intestinal Mucosa of HIV-infected treatment-naive Individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed miRNAs between HIV-infected treatment-na√Øve individuals and HIV-negative individuals were found, and the altered signaling pathways were predicted using these differentially expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, RNA from three HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals and three HIV-negative healthy individuals was used to detect the expression levels of miRNAs with 3,100 miRNA probes.
