TITLE
Transcriptional changes in soybean nodules with the loss of expression of GmbHLHm1

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
This study was conducted to investigate the changes in gene expression that occurs with the silencing of GmbHLHm1. GmbHLHm1 is a membrane localised DNA binding transcription factor that is important for nodule development.  Its activity is linked to ammonium transport.
