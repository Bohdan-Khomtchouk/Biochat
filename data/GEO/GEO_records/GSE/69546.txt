TITLE
Expression data from Xenopus laevis juvenile inner ear tissue

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The genes involved in inner ear development have yet to be fully characterized. Previous gene-based analyses have primarily focused on the early developmental stages following induction and initial formation of the inner ear. The inner ear continues to grow and develop until the auditory and vestibular systems reach full maturity; all of the genes involved in this process have yet to be identified. The aim of this study is to identify additional candidate genes for inner ear development. Microarrays were used to produce expression profiles from the post-metamorphic juvenile stage of the Xenopus laevis inner ear.

DESIGN
Xenopus inner ears were isolated from juvenile animals for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays.
