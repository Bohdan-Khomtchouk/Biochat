TITLE
The influence of WWOX tumor supressor gene on endometrial cancerogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The WWOX gene is a tumor suppressor probably involved in variety of cellular processes including  and is ferquently downregulated in variety of cancer types. However, its role in endometrial cancerogenesis is not well described. The aim of this study was to characterize how WWOX  may be involved in endometrial cancerogenesis, how it influences the basic cancer cell features and modifies cell expression profile.Our observations suggest that in ECC1 endometrial cancer cell line increased expression of WWOX may  be involved in the initiation of EMT, leading to changes in cell adhesion and motility but also indicate its suppressive role in the process of mesenchymal phenotype acquisition, resulting in reduction of aggressiveness cell features

DESIGN
Well differentiated ECC1 endometrial cancer cells were stably transfected with WWOX cDNA.ECC1 cells transfected with an empty vector served as a control. Total mRNA was isolated to look for gene-expression differences induced by the WWOX overexpression.
