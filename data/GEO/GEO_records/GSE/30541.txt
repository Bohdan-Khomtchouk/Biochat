TITLE
bFGF-selected Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells triggers the host response for bone regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The classical concept of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC), intended as a uniform, broad potent population, is progressively being substituted by the idea that the bone marrow harbors heterogeneous populations of non-hematopoietic stem cells. This in vivo heterogeneity is also amplified by the different experimental strategies used to isolate/culture them. Among the exogenous factors described to affect MSC in vitro growth, basic-fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most common growth factors used to expand stem cells. Moreover, it has been reported that its signaling is associated with the mainteinance of stemness of a variety of stem cells, included MSC. Using an ectopic model of bone regeneration, we have previously described that the implantation of cells with different commitment levels, differentially influences the capacity to recruit host cells, activating endogenous regenerative mechanisms. Due to its properties, we here demonstrate that the addition of bFGF to primary BM cultures, leads to the selection of specific subpopulations able to induce a different host regenerative response, when in vivo implanted in association with suitable ceramic scaffolds. Moreover, taking advantage of a multiparametric and comparative genomic and proteomic approach, it has been evaluated how different culture conditions combine to bring about appreciable changes in the secretome of the cells, that consequently influence their in vivo regenerative behaviour. The full comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms that rule the host response depending on the type and differentiative stage of the transplanted cells could help us to develop novel clinical strategies where host cells could directly contribute to regenerate the appropriate tissue.
