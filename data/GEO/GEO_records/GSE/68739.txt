TITLE
UV-B-induced gene expression changes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
We analysed global gene expression changes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to 1h UV-B, applied at the same low level that was seen to promote subsequent UV-B stress tolerance, in order to elucidate the transcriptional reprogramming that leads to UV-B acclimation.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles generated by deep sequencing from triplicate replicate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii samples sourced from independent cultures either protected from UV-B or exposed to 1h acclimation-level UV-B.

PLATFORM
GPL18482 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii)
