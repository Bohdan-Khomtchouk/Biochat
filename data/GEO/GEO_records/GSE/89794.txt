TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of WT and p190-B-/- HSC after bone marrow transplantation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall goals are these experiments are to identify genes and pathways that are critical for hematopoietic stem cell functions during bone marrow regeneration after transplantation. We have found that loss of expression of p190-B RhoGAP, a negative regulator of RhoGTPase, enhances HSC long-term engraftment. Hence, we used microarray analysis to compare gene exprssion profile of WT and p190-B-/- HSC after transplantation.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of mRNA in HSCs from WT and p190-B-/- transplanted mice

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
