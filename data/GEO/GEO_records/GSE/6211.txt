TITLE
Gene Transcription Profile of Local Innate and Adaptive Immunity during Early Phase of IBV Infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanistic basis of local innate and adaptive immunity against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at the molecular level, we examined the gene transcription profile of tracheal epithelial layers at 3 days after infection of chickens with an attenuated IBV-Massachusetts strain. Keywords: Disease State Analysis, Early mucosal immune response, FHCRC 13k chicken array

DESIGN
For the DNA microarray experiment, total RNA was reverse transcribed and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes and hybridized to the chicken 13K cDNA microarray (FHCRC, Seattle, WA) which contains 13,000 genes derived from both embryonic and adult chicken tissues including immune genes. The experiment was repeated four times using swapped Cy3 or Cy5 dye labeling.
