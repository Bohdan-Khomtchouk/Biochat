TITLE
Repertoire of BALB/c mice natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
One of the most common genetic backgrounds for mice used as model to investigate human diseases is the BALB/c strain. This work is aimed to characterize the pattern of natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies present in serum of BALB/c mice by printed glycan array technology. Natural antibodies from serum of BALB/c mice interacted with at least 70 glycans from a library of 419 different carbohydrate structures. However, only a restricted number of these (12, ~17%) were highly recognized by natural antibodies, and shared by more than 80% of mice under examination. This conserved pattern differed dramatically from that of humans. This finding together with not identical repertoires of antibodies between individual mice should be specially considered when mouse models are intended to be used for investigation of human natural antibodies in different biomedical research and diagnostic contexts.

DESIGN
To study the repertoire of natural circulating anti-carbohydrate antibodies, serum from 20 BALB/c mice was evaluated by printed glycan-array technology (PGA). Microarrays were prepared by Semiotik LLC (Moscow, Russia) from 419 different amine-functionalized glycans, using N-hydroxysuccinimide-derivatized glass slides H Schott-Nexterion (Germany). All glycans were printed in 6 replicates. The glycan library included blood group antigens and other most frequent terminal oligosaccharides and their cores of mammalian N- and O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids, tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens.
