TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiles of primary human SAECs infected with different adenovirus mutants.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Full title: Genome-wide expression profiles of primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) infected with different adenovirus mutants. Expression arrays were used to analyze global gene expression changes in SAECs infected with either mock, dE1B-55k, or d55k/dORF3 adenovirus at 36 hours post infection, as well as nutlin treatment for 12 hours.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments were performed with each experimental condition done in duplicate. CEL files were imported and analyzed with Partek Analysis software.
