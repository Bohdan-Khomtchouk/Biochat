TITLE
SND1 Transcription Factor-Directed Quantitative Functional Hierarchical Genetic Regulatory Network in Wood Formation in Populus trichocarpa

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
We focused on RNA-seq-based full transcriptome responses to PtrSND1-B1 overexpression at 7, 12, and 25 h in stem defferentiating xylem (SDX) protoplasts

DESIGN
We transfected PtrSND1-B1 and sGFP into stem differentiating xylem protoplasts and performed RNA-seq to reveal the whole transcriptome.
