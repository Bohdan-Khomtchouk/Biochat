TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation profile of developing deciduous tooth germ in miniature pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Background: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification critical to the regulation of gene expression during development. To date, little is known about the role of DNA methylation in tooth development in large animal models. Thus, we carried out a comparative genomic analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in E50 and E60 tooth germ from miniature pigs using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq).Results: We observed different DNA methylation patterns during the different developmental stages of pig tooth germ. A total of 2,469 differentially methylated genes were identified. Functional analysis identified several signaling pathways and 104 genes that may be potential key regulators of pig tooth development from E50 to E60.Conclusions: The present study provided a comprehensive analysis of the global DNA methylation pattern of tooth germ in miniature pigs and identified candidate genes that potentially regulate tooth development from E50 to E60.
