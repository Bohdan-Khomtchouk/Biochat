TITLE
Expression data of synovial cells isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic and systemic disease of unknown etiology, is characterized by hyperplasia of synovial cells, which ultimately lead to the destruction of cartilage and bone.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to RA, we analyzed synovial cells established from patient with RA by oligonucleotide microarrays.  Gene expression profiles reveal a novel pathophysiologic function of RA synovial cells as a generator of oxidative stress, and a self-defense mechanism against self-generated oxidative stress. Keywords: cell type comparison, disease state analysis

DESIGN
We isolated synovial cell culture from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.  Fibroblast from patient with osteoarthritis was used for the reference.
