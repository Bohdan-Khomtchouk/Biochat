TITLE
Kat2a regulates hippocampal memory formation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 24 samples extracted from mouse CA1 tissue to generate the first CA1-specific murine transcriptome and the first CA1-transcriptome in response to environmental novelty under normal and Kat2a-loss-of-function conditions.

DESIGN
Samples were divded in 4 groups: A: Control naïve (n=6), B: control novelty-exposed (n=5), C: Kat2a cKO naïve (n=6), D: Kat2a cKO novelty-exposed (n=7). Pairwise comparisons for AvsB, AvsC, BvsD and CvsD were performed using DESeq2.
