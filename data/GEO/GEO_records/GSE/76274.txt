TITLE
Comprehensive genomic analysis identify novel subtypes and targets of triple-negative breast cancer (67 not triple-negative tumors)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent meta-analyses suggest triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous disease. In this study we sought to define these TNBC subtypes and identify subtype-specific markers and targets. We identified and confirmed four distinct, stable TNBC subtypes: (1) Luminal-AR (LAR); 2) Mesenchymal (MES); 3) Basal-Like Immune-Suppressed (BLIS), and 4) Basal-Like Immune-Activated (BLIA).

DESIGN
RNA profiling analyses were conducted on 198 TNBC tumors (ER-negativity defined as Allred Scale value â‰¤2) with > 50% cellularity (discovery set: n=84; validation set: n=114)  and 67 not triple-negative tumors.
