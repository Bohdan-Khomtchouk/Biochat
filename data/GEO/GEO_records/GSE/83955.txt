TITLE
Bladder cancer lncRNA expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive lncRNA array, we screened the lncRNAs abundant in the human bladder cancer and Adjacent normal bladder tissues, and the function of differentially expressed lncRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics.

DESIGN
The Arraystar Human lncRNA Array (8x15K, Arraystar) and whole human mRNA Array (4x44K, Arraystar) and was used to profile differentially expressed lncRNAs and genes in bladder cancer vs. normal tissues following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, extracted RNA template (1mg) was reversely transcribed into cDNA and digested into fragments with endonucleases. These fragments were labeled with DNA labeling reagent and labeled cDNAs were hybridized to the microarray via incubation at 45°C and rotated at 60 rpm for 17 h. Following washing and staining, the arrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner3000 with GeneChip Operating Software.
