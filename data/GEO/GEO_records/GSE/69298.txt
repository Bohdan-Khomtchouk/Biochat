TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of cellulolytic fungus Penicillium oxalicum and transcription factor mutant strains in response to different carbon sources

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to compare the responses of Penicillium oxalicum strains to different carbon sources including carbon-starvation, glucose and cellulose. The wild-type strain and transcription facor (ClrB, CreA and AmyR) mutants were studied.

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples were analzyed, which include biological triplicates. The wild-type strain cultured without carbon source was considered as a reference.
