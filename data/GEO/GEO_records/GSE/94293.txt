TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in adult head of Canton-S and Bully lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Goal: Identify genes that are differentially expressed in hyper-aggressive Bully line. We used wildtype Canton-S flies as control. We also explored the effect of developmental temperature on gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from 6-day-old adult heads from Canton-S or Bully lines that were raised at 19C or 25C. A total of 4 samples were obtained. For each sample, 2 independent biological replicates were included.
