TITLE
Expression data from Chronic Unpredict Mild Stress-induced depression in GK rats‘ liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To explored the mechanism of pharmacokinetic perturbation in chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) resulting depression, CUMS-induced depression animal model with spontaneous diabetic GK rats were established. The expression profile in GK rats' livers were screened using Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 Array.

DESIGN
Male GK rats emergenced of diabetes symptom, then were randomly divided into two groups: control group and CUMS group. Rats were sacrificed after 8 weeks' CUMS resulting in depression. Rat’s livers were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
