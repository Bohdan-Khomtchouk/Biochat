TITLE
Small RNAs in rice seed

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Small RNAs are common and effective modulators of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. To characterize the small RNAs expressed during rice seed development, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) was performed, resulting in the obtainment of 22-nt sequence signatures. Through integrative analysis,novel miRNAs were identified mostly based on the miRNA* accumulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated separately from rice seeds collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 days after anthesis (DAA), then mixed into a library and separated on denatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The fraction of 18-26 nt small RNA was recovered by small RNA gel extraction Kit.
