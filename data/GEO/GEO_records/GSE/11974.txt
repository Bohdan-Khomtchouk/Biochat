TITLE
Small RNAs in rice seed

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Small RNAs are common and effective modulators of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. To characterize the small RNAs expressed during rice seed development, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) was performed, resulting in the obtainment of 22-nt sequence signatures. Through integrative analysis,novel miRNAs were identified mostly based on the miRNA* accumulation.
