TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 3T3 fibroblast cells cultured with degradable metallic materials

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metals have been used for coronary artery stent materials in order to prevent stenosis caused by atherosclerosis. Degradable metallic materials (DMMs) are considered to be useful to avoid in-stent restenosis and late thrombosis.  A new DMM, Fe-35Mn alloy, was fabricated through powder metallurgy in order to satisfy the ideal criteria of cardiovascular stent made of DMM. Since in-stent restenosis is mediated by the extracellular matrix production, which is mostly regulated by fibroblasts, the gene expression profile of 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of Fe-35Mn alloy was then investigated. The mechanism of cellular responses in the presence of DMM is then expected to be clearly described through the gene profiling experiment.

DESIGN
3T3 fibroblast cells derived from mouse (Mus musculus) embryo (BALB/3T3 clone A31, ATTC) were put in the culture and treated with iron, manganese, and Fe-35Mn alloy for 24 hour in parallel and followed by the RNA extraction. Six technical replicates were included for treated cells as well as control cells.
