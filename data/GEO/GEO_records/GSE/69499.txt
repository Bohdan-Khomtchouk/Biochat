TITLE
Expression data from Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitor (MEP) cells isolated from JAK2V617F/Ezh2Δ/Δ mice post JQ1 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss-of-function mutations in EZH2 are associated with worse outcomes in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF).  To understand how EZH2 insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of PMF, we generated mice compound for Ezh2 conditional deletion and a JAK2V617F transgene.

DESIGN
The total bone marrow cells isolated from JAK2V617F;Ezh2flox/flox;Cre-ERT2 mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ wild-type recipient mice. Post the deletion of Ezh2, we administered JAK2V617F/Ezh2Δ/Δ mice with JQ1 or control DMSO for two weeks, and performed gene-expression analysis of bone marrow LSKs and MEPs immediately after completion of JQ1 treatment.
