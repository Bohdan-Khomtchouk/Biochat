TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E15 ureter. (GUDMAP Series ID: 26)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing genitourinary tract.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here delineates the gene expression profiles of the e15 mouse ureter.  Comparisons with the same compartments in the neonate will be made to determine changes in gene expression from relatively undifferentiated tissue (e15) to a highly differentiated structure (neonate).

DESIGN
FVB/N mice were time mated. At embryonic day 15 mice were euthanized by decapitation and the ureters were microdissected, cut from pelvis to the bladder insertion point and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
