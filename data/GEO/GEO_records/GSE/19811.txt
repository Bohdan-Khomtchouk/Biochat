TITLE
Inflammation and macrophage activation in adipose tissue of HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile in subcutaneous adipose tissue between controls and HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral treatment.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy from 7 HIV-infected patients and 6 control subjects were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
