TITLE
Expression data from Germ-Free (GF) and L.NK2-colonized mice intestinal epithelial cells and Peyer's patches cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus NK2 (L.NK2) is a commensal microbe, isolated from the mouse intestinal feces in our lab. To examine the potential role of L. NK2 in the gut immunity, we monocolonized GF mice with L.NK2. And, we conducted a microarray experiment to compare the transcriptomes of GF and L.NK2-colonized mice intestines under the same experimental condition We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and Peyer's patches cells (PP) of GF and L.NK2-colonized mice.

DESIGN
GF mice monocolonized with 1*10^8 L.NK2, two weeks later, IEC and PP of GF and L.NK2-colonized mice of the same physiological and maintaining condition were isolated and then total RNAs were extracted from them, which could reflect the respective transcription profile of GF and L.NK2-colonized mice. These RNAs were detected by microarray and the influence of L.NK2 on intestine could be revealed to some extent.
