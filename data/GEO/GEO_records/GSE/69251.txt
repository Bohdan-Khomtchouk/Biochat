TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of histone H3 lysine 27 and lysine 4 trimethylation in multiple myeloma reveals the importance of Polycomb gene targeting and highlights EZH2 as a potential therapeutic target [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
in this study we define an epigenomic profile of PRC2 (H3K27me3 and bivalent) tragets in four newly diagnosed MM patients. Using Oncomine database we demonstarte that PRC2 targets are underexpressed with advanced ISS stages and correlated to poor outcome. Pharmacological inhibition of UNC1999 showed anti-myeloma potential in vitro by activating the expression genes related to apoptosis and cell differenatiation.

DESIGN
In this array the differences between the gene expression profiles of samll molecule inhibitor (UNC1999) of EZH2 and the control (UNC2400) have been tested. So multiple myeloma cell line INA-6 was treated with 2Î¼M of UNC1999 and UNC2400. This design contains three biological replicates.
