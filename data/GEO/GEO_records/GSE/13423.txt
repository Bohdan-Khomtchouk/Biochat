TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Sodium Hypochlorite on Mycobacterium bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG str. Pasteur 1173P2

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Mycobacterium bovis BCG GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Mycobacterium bovis BCG to Sodium Hypochlorite, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Sodium Hypochlorite. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three Sodium Hypochlorite-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 10 and 20 min exposures.
