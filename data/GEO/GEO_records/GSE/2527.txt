TITLE
Gata-1 Knock Down - Wild Type Megakaryocyte Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from 13.5 day mouse fetal livers by lineage depletion and expanded for three days. Fetal livers were isolated from both wild type and Gata-1 knock embryos. Gata-1 knock embryos contain a deletion of the Gata-1 promoter sequence that results in undetectable levels of Gata-1 protein specifically in the megakaryocyte lineage. Following progenitor outgrowth  megakaryocytes were enriched in a differentiation media for three days and isolated on a discontinuous BSA gradient. The resulting megakaryocytes were > 90% pure as determined by acetylcholinesterase staining. These cells were lysed in Trizol and the resulting RNA was used for hybridization.
