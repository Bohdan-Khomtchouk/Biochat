TITLE
SAGE analysis of human glomerular endothelial cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue from macroscopically healthy parts of nephrectomized kidneys. Endothelial cells were purified from the cell outgrowth of glomeruli twice using CD31 magnetic beads and cultured on fibronectin coated surface. Cells were not passaged more than eight times and stained with vWf, CD31, and after stimulation with TNF alpha also with CD62E/P.

DESIGN
This GEO Series was created by the GEO staff as part of a cleanup effort to ensure that all GEO Samples are included within a Series entry.
