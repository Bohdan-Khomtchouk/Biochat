TITLE
NINDS Rat Neuron Parkinsons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The cardinal clinical features of Parkinson's disease result from selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.  The goal of this experiment is to determine the gene expression profiles of these neurons by studying untreated rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons using laser capture microscopy to obtain region-specific neuronal mRNA. WARNING: These data are identical to those represented in GEO Series GSE1837.
