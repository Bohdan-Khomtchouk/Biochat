TITLE
Reversal of Aberrant Cancer Methylome and Transcriptome upon Direct Reprogramming of Lung Cancer Cells [Methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC) lines were reprogrammed with Yamanaka's cocktail and their methylome and transcriptome were studied and characterized.

DESIGN
We compared reprogrammed cells to their respective parent (2 NSCLC and 1 human lung fetal fibroblast) and used H1 as a positive control for pluripotency characteristics. The in vitro differentiated cells were also compared to the reprogrammed cells. All samples have biological triplicates except for differentiated cells.
