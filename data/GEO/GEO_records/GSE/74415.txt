TITLE
Small RNA and mRNA expression profiling during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Previous studies of zebrafish caudal fin regeneration have shown that multiple genetic programs are moduled through regulatory factors.  MicroRNAs are short highly conserved non-coding genes that suppress expression of target genes and thereby control multiple genetic programs.  Given their important regulatory roles and evolutionary conservation, we hypothesize that microRNAs define a conserved genetic regulatory circuit important for appendage regeneration.  We characterized microRNA expression during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration using small RNA sequencing.  The stages of caudal fin regeneration were assayed for mRNA expression using mRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Small RNA and mRNA gene expression profiling during 0 and 4 days post amputation.
