TITLE
The Phytoestrogen Genistein Is a Tissue-Specific Androgen Receptor Modulator

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that the phytoestrogen genistein acts as a tissue-specific androgen receptor modulator in mouse using a novel androgen reporter mouse line and gene expression profiling. Genistein is a partial androgen agonist/antagonist in prostate, brain, and testis but not in skeletal muscle or lung. Gene expression profiling has been done from prostates of intact and castrated male mice treated with genistein or vehicle. Gene expression profiling was also done from prostates of estradiol-treated intact male mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling from prostates of castrated and intact male mice after 5-day genistein- or vehicle-treatment or after 4-day estradiol- or vehicle-treatment.
