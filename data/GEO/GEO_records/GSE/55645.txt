TITLE
Genome wide analysis of copy number variation in NAFLD spectrum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite some success in identifying CNVs responsible for metabolic phenotypes including obesity and diabetes mellitus, there are as yet no data available to suggest whether or not CNVs might be involved in the etiology of the NAFLD spectrum. This report is a comprehensive analysis of copy number in Malaysian patients with NAFLD.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood obtained from patients with NAFLD and submitted for genome-wide analysis using aCGH
