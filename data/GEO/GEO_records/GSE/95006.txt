TITLE
Next-Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and csrA Mutant Helicobacter pylori J99 Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori J99

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to clarify the CsrA-regulatory system in H. pylori by NGS-derived transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq). Method: CsrA regulatory system was determined by comparative transcriptomic analysis carried out with RNA-seq on strain J99 and csrA mutant. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, fifty-three genes in the csrA mutant were found to be differentially expressed compared with the wild-type. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of CsrA-regulatory system in H. pylori J99.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and csrA mutant J99 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using 5500XL SOLiDâ„¢ Sequencer System.
