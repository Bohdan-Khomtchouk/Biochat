TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - Response to herbivory by Diatraea saccharalis

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Sugarcane stalk borer larvae were grown on artificial diet and maintained at 25°C and 60±10% relative humidity with a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle. Second instar larvae were maintained under fasting conditions for 18 h and transferred to two-month old plants (genotype SP80-3280, CTC, Brazil). Leaves were collected after 30 min and 24 h of exposure to herbivory for the control and experimental groups. Two plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of stress response
