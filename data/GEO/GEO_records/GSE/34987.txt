TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of GW3965-responsive genes in 4 different breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, T-47D, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in response to the LXR agonist GW3965 in the MCF-7, T-47D, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.  It was previously reported that GW3965 has antiproliferative effects on these 4 different breast cancer cell lines. In the present study, we additionally determine the effects of the LXR ligand on breast cancer cells and determine their mechanism of action in reducing cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 4 different breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231) grown in culture treated with ethanol (control) or GW3965 (GW-treated, experimental) for 48 hours. Triplicates were performed.
