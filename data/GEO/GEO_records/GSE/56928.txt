TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling reveals distinct functions of thymic stromal subsets and age-related changes during thymic involution

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The thymic microenvironment is essential for proper differentiation and selection of thymocytes.Thymic involution in aged mice results in decreased T cell output and immune function. Here we use gene expression profiling of FACS sorted thymic stromal subsets to identify molecular mediators of thymocyte: stromal cell interactions, as well as gene expression changes thymic stromal subsets during early stages of thymic involution . We used microarrays to analyze gene expression differences between thymic stromal subsets from male C57BL/6J mice 1, 3,  and 6 months of age.

DESIGN
Thymic stromal subsets (cTEC, mTEClo, mTEChi, Sirpa-DC, Sirpa+DC, and fibroblasts) were isolated from two 1-, 3-, and 6- month old male C57BL/6J mice.  After enzymatic digestion of the thymi, the stromal cells were FACS purified, and RNA was extracted, amplified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arraysarrays. Raw data were uploaded to Gene Expression Commons for normalization. Both raw CEL and normalized datasets from the 36 samples are included. A model within Gene Expression Commons has been created for analyses/comparisons of these datasets, along with previously reported thymocyte subset datasets. The model within Gene Expression Commons thus contains 6 thymic stromal populations, each from mice 1, 3, and 6 months of age, with duplicates for each datset.
