TITLE
Rat Normal Cochlear Nucleus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The cochlear nucleus is the first central pathway involved in the processing of peripheral auditory activity.  It is heterogeneous in neuronal populations and physiologic responses and is organized in three major subdivisions: the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) and the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN).  Although each region demonstrates multiple cell types and functions, there are predominant populations of neurons in each region that underlie the principal role each subdivision plays in auditory processing.  Little is known of the underlying genetic contribution to these properties.  This study sought to identify genes expressed in the subdivisions of the cochlear nucleus that may account for the anatomical and physiological characteristics of each subdivision. These data provide a genetic basis for understanding normal auditory processing in the cochlear nucleus and a template for investigating changes that may occur with hearing loss, the generation and percept of tinnitus, and central processing disorders. Keywords: normal, comparative

DESIGN
Brown Norway rats (n=40, female, 45days) were anesthetized and decapitated.  Brains were rapidly removed and the subdivisions of the cochlear nucleus (AVCN, PVCN and DCN) dissected on dry ice.  Total RNA was extracted and tested for concentration and purity by spectrophotometry and integrity by gel electrophoresis.  SAGE was performed using the NlaIII enzyme and Invitrogen SAGE kit.  Concatemers were commercially sequenced and imported into eSAGE (Margulies and Innis, 2000) for tag extraction and frequency.
