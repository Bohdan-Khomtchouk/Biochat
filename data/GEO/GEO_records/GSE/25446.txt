TITLE
Genome-wide comparison of H3K27me3 difference between ref6-1 and wild type Col

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that REF6/JMJ12 (RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6/Jumonji domain-containing protein 12) could demethylate H3K27me3. Loss of REF6/JMJ12 leads to ectopic and increased H3K27me3 of a large spectrum of genes involved in development and responses to stimuli.

DESIGN
Examination of differences in H3K27me3 between ref6-1 and wild type Col.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
