TITLE
Co-clinical analysis of a genetically-engineered mouse model and human prostate cancer reveals significance of NKX3.1 expression for response to 5Î±-reductase inhibition (Mouse Finasteride Prostate RNASeq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome from 12 month old finasteride (and vehicle) treated mouse prostatic tissue Prostate tissue from 12 month old Nkx3.1+/+ and Nkx3.1-/- mice treated with finasteride (or vehicle) was harvested, and snap frozen for subsequent molecular analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tissues. Prostate tissues were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
