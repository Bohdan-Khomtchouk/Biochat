TITLE
Effects of miR-106a~363 blocking sponge on Sk-ES-1 Ewing Sarcoma Cell line Gene Expression Profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of miR-106a~363 blockade on the gene expression profile of Ewing Sarcoma cell lines (Sk-ES-1 cells)

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on 3 samples from Sk-ES-1 cells stably expressing the control CXCR4 miRNA sponge and 3 samples from Sk-ES-1 cells stably expressing the miR-106a~363 cluster blocking miRNA sponge
