TITLE
Expression profile of Ceacam1 downstream genes in NSC and NSCL61

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Ceacam1 downstream factors, we compared gene expressions between NSCs and Ceacam1L-expressing NSC and between NSCL61 and Ceacam1shRNA-expressing NSCL61.

DESIGN
We established Ceacam1L-expressing NSC and Ceacam1shRNA-expressing NSCL61s. We think that genes, which are differently expressed between NSC and Ceacam1L-NSC, and between NSCL61 and Ceacam1shRNA-NSCL61, are the Ceacam1 downstream factors.
