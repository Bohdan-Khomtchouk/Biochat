TITLE
The cold shock response of Bacillus subtilis analyzed by RNA-sequencing: YplP regulates pyruvate transport at low temperatures

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
The cold shock response of B. subtilis was defined after 0.5 hr and 2 hr cold shock using RNA sequencing. We identified novel RNAs (including non-coding RNAs) that play a role during growth at low temperatures. Deletion of the cold induced protein YplP results in a cold sensitive phenotype, and a comparative RNA sequencing analysis suggests that YplP induces pftAB expression after prolonged incubation at low temperatures, thereby optimizing pyruvate transport under cold shock conditions.
