TITLE
Knockout mice lacking MG56

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To survey altered gene expression in MG56-knockout muscle, total RNA preparations from mouse hindlimb muscle and hearts were subjected to gene microarray analysis. Results exhibit the effects of MG56 deficiency on overall transcription, and may further imply the biological role of MG56.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were preparated from Tibialis-anterior (TA) muscle and hearts of three P9 MG56-knockout mice and the corresponding wild-type mice were mixed and then subjected to Affymetrix Mus musculus microarrays.
