TITLE
MicroRNA expression data in human fetal lungs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data of human fetal lungs between 16-23 weeks of gestation. The results provide a general insight into the microRNA expression profile during the canalicular phase of lung development.

DESIGN
Lung tissue samples for microarray analysis were obtained through the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Tissue Bank through an approved IRB protocol and de-identified using an honest broker system. Total RNA was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized on Agilent 8X15K microRNA array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After 20 hours hybridization, arrays were washed and scanned according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL8227 Agilent-019118 Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B (miRNA ID version)
