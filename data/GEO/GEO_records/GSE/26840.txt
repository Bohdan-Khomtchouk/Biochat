TITLE
Express data from rice endosperm

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Immatured rice seeds 7-8 days after pollination were used for expression analysis and matured rice leaf was used as control. Targets from biological replicates of both were generated and the expression were determined using Affymetrix Rice Genome arrays.

DESIGN
Rice immatured seed after 7-8 days pollination were selected of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Matured rice leaf was set as control. Each with 3 replicates were analyzed.
