TITLE
The genetics and regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation in human lymphoblastoid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We set out to investigate genomic mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals. We used 3’-end RNA-seq to maximize genome coverage and precision of transcript end positions, and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms. The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3’ UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3’ length form usage.

DESIGN
Survey of transcript 3' end positions in B-lymphocyte cell lines derived from six human individuals (two biological replicates each)
