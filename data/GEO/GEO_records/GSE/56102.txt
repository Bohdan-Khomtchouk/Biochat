TITLE
siRNA-mediated knockdown of VAMP7 in NTERA2/D1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To unravel the function of VAMP7 in the male sexual differentiation, we carried out in vitro studies of VAMP7 knockdown using siRNA, in the human embryonal carcinoma NTERA2/D1 cells.

DESIGN
We knocked down VAMP7 expression in the testicular teratocarcinoma cell line, NTERA2/D1. By comparing the knockdown conditions with the control scrambled samples, we are able to dissect the cellular pathways affected by alteration of VAMP7 gene expression.
