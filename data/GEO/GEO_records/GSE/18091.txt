TITLE
Dihydrotestosterone induced changes in gene expression in immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induced changes in gene expression in immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells. Analysis of regulation of immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells by dihydrotestosterone at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the androgen-eye interaction in ocular surface epithelial cells like meibomian gland cells is influenced by androgens through regulation of the expression of multiple genes. Results provide important information of the differential regulation of numerous genes in response to dihydrotestosterone incubation of immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells treated for 72 hours with 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (n=3) or vehicle (n=3).  The RNA was then used with Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 Expression BeadChips to determine the effect of DHT on gene expression in an immortalized human meibomian epithelial cell line developed in our laboratory.
