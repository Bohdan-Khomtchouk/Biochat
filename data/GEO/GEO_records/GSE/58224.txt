TITLE
Expression data from Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line BL2 transiently transfected with Epstein-Barr Virus miRNA mimics BART 18-5p, 10, 14*

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular targets for most of EBV miRNAs are not known. In our study, we aimed at identifying genes that are regulated by individual EBV mature miRNA, particularly BART 18-5p We used microarrays to explore the global gene expression (particularly the downregulated genes) targeted by EBV miRNA mimics.

DESIGN
Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, BL2 and BJAB, were transfected with miRNA mimic control (MC) and EBV miRNA mimics BART 18-5p, 10 and 14* for 24 hour prior to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix human HGU133 plus 2.0 microarrays.
