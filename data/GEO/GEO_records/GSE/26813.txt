TITLE
Expression data from human fibroblasts 6 and 12 hours after 8-oxoguanine treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8-oxoguanine is excised from DNA by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 during DNA base excision repair. We used microarrays to gain insight into the potential biological function of the excised, free 8-oxoguanine base.

DESIGN
MRC5, human diploid fibroblasts were exposed to 8-oxoguanine and changes in gene expression compared to mock control were analyzed 6 hours after exposure. MRC5, human diploid fibroblasts were exposed to 8-oxoguanine and changes in gene expression compared to mock control were analyzed 12 hours after exposure.
