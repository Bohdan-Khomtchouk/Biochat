TITLE
Gene expression profiling in DLBCL primary clinical samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed for 28 DLBCL primary clinical samples and assignment of activated B-cell-like(ABC)/germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL classes, B-cell-associated gene signature (BAGS), and a probability of response to doxorubicin was performed for each sample.

DESIGN
28 DLBCL primary clinical samples for which gene expression was determined with Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Gene expression was normalized together with expression from 34 DLBCL primary clinical samples that have been included in GSE56315.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
