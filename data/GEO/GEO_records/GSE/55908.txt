TITLE
Long noncoding RNA as putative biomarkers for protstate cancer detection [Set 1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify which lncRNAs are differentially expressed in prostate cancer, total RNA from prostate cancer cell line, PC3, and normal epithelial prostatic cells were screened using NCode (Life Technologies) . The NCode microarray is designed to interrogate 12,784 lncRNAs and 25,409 mRNA target protein-coding genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in prostate epithelial cells and PC3 was measured. Three independent experiments (biological replicates) were performed.
