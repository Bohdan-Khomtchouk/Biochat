TITLE
Comparisons of gene expressions in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain and gill after cold acclimation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Ambient temperature affects organisms comprehensively, however cold responses are different among tissues. Here, we adopt a transcript screening approach to explore and compare the cold responses in zebrafish gills and brain. Zebrafish were exposed to cold and the oligonucleotide-based microarray was used to identify cold-induced genes. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression profiles indicated that gills develop different strategies for the increasing of exposure period while brain relatively remained stable. Combining statistic and clustering methods, we found that gills showed higher protein metabolism and cell activity while brain showed higher stress responses and detoxification during cold acclimation. According to the microarray data sets, we extended the study on ionocyte- and isotocin neuron-related genes in gills and brain, respectively, and found these genes were broadly stimulated by cold. These data suggest that cold activates specific physiological functions in different tissues. Taken together, our results provide molecular evidences to elucidate the cold acclimation in zebrafish gills and brain. Keywords: Time course, Tissue types
