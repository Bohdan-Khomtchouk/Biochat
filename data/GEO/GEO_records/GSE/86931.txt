TITLE
Exercise-induced transcriptome changes in skeletal muscle adapted to aerobic training

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA in vastus lateralis muscle samples from two amateur endurance-trained men (V’о 2max 57 ml/min/kg) before and after acute endurance exercise

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA prior to, 4 h, and 8 h after acute intensive cycling session (70 min, 70% V’о 2max )

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
