TITLE
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer is a molecularly distinct estrogen-sensitive subclass of aggressive prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Common epithelial cancers are believed to become more aggressive through the accumulation of multiple independent molecular events that lead to the deregulation of cell signaling. However, the discovery that the majority of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions of the 5'-untranslated region of androgen regulated TMPRSS2 promoter with ETS transcription factor family members has brought this paradigm into question1,2. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is the most common molecular sub-type of prostate cancer. Recent work suggests that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype3. In the most advanced castration resistant prostate cancers where the androgen receptor has been inactivated, the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion remains functionally active. Here we show compelling clinical and gene expression data supporting the existence of a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer subclass. Using expression array profiling on 455 primary prostate tumors, we identified an 87 gene expression signature, distinguishing TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer as a discrete molecular entity. Computational analysis suggested that this fusion signature was associated with estrogen receptor signaling. Functional studies demonstrated regulation of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript by estrogenic compounds. These data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulation of the TMPRSS2-ERG, even in the absence of a functional androgen receptor, and thus may have broader implications in the treatment of prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Test Cohort: 388 cases from the population based Swedish-Watchful Waiting cohort. The cohort consists of men with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1-T2, Mx, N0); Validation cohort: The Physiciansâ€™ Health Study (PHS) cohort included 116 US men diagnosed with incidental prostate cancer between 1983 and 2003; 455 cases were annotated for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Test Set: GSM208029 ... GSM208392 Validation Set: GSM208404 ... GSM208512
