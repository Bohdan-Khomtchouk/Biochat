TITLE
The Gene Expression Profile of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from EV71-Infected Rhesus Neonates

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
To study the gene expression during EV71 infection, we have employed whole Rhesus Monkey genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish infection process. Rhesus monkey peripheral blood from the experiment or control donors was isolated, extracted the RNA and screened by microarray. The results indicated that the expression levels of more than 500 functional genes associated with multiple pathways were modulated. To confirm the results of the microarray analysis, 25 individual genes were random selected and were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR amplification. The expression levels of genes associated with immune inflammatory responses were up-regulated during the period from day 4 to 10 post-infection. The expressions of two genes (TAC1 and IL17A), which play major roles in inflammatory reactions, were remarkably up-regulated during the infection period.

DESIGN
Enterovirus 71 infection induced gene expression in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured at 4, 7 and 10 days after viral infection.  Three samples from two experiment donors and one control donor were performed at each time (4, 7 or 10 days). To exclude the individual difference, mix the two experiment samples at each time, and mix the three control samples.
