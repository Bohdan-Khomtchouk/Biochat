TITLE
Effects of aged garlic extract (AGE) and FruArg on lipopolysaccharide-induced genetic response in microglial cells using gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that aged garlic extract, and a pure compound from it, FruArg, can repress the genetic response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We applied gene expression profiling to understand the potential mechanisms of the protective effects of AGE and FruArg against LPS stress in BV-2 cells. Gene expression profiling showed that AGE repressed the transcriptome alteration induced by LPS. FruArg, as an active compound in AGE, accounted for AGE's protective effects. These results suggest that AGE and FruArg are capable of alleviating oxidative and neuroinflammatory responses stimulated by LPS in BV-2 cells.

DESIGN
Using mouse microglia cells BV-2, we treated cells with control solvent, 100ng/mL LPS, LPS+AGE (0.5% v.v), and LPS+FruArg (3mM). 2 biological replicates for each treatment were performed.
