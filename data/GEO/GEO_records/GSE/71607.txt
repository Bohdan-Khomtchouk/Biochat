TITLE
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, immunity and detoxification in the amebocyte-producing organ of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
In order to understanding the transcriptome responses of the amebocyte-producing organ (APO) of the snails Biomphalaria glabrata after exposure to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), we investigated transcriptomic responses of the APO dissected from the snails at 24 hours post-injection with bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Three PAMPs that include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan, and fucoidan that may mimic fucosyl-rich glycan PAMPs on sporocysts of Schistosoma mansoni, were tested. Based upon the number of genes differentially expressed, LPS exhibited the strongest activity, relative to saline-injected controls. A concurrent activation of genes involved in cell proliferation, immune response and detoxification metabolism was observed.

DESIGN
Three PAMPs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS),  peptidoglycan (PGN), and fucoidan (FUC) was tested. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as control. The APO was dissected after 24 hours post-injection with indiividual PAMPs or PBS. For each treatment, 4 biological replicates were used. Since APO is very small, 20 APO were pooled as a biological sample. So a total of 80 APOs (from 80 snails) were used for one treatment. A total of 320 APOs from 320 snails (80 x 4) were used for the four treatments (3 PAMPs plus 1 PBS control).
