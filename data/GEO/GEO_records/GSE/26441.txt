TITLE
Kinetic analysis of carolacton regulated genes

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of carolacton treated S. mutans biofilm cells in comparison to untreated biofilms in a time series approach.

DESIGN
Two condition times series experiment, carolacton treated vs. untreated for timepoints 20, 40, 60, 120 and 300 minutes post carolacton addition, 2 technical replicates of each sample (dye swap), conditions 20, 60, 300 Min in 3 biological replicates, condition 120 Min in 2 biological replicates, condition 40 min one biological sample

PLATFORM
