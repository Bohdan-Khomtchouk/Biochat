TITLE
Gene expression of breast cancer cell lines treated with conditioned medium derived from NAF and CAF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated nine lines of breast cancer cells with conditioned medium derived from NAF and CAF to study the paracrine interaction beetween stroma and tumor. Gene expression profiles for breast cancer cell lines are reported after 72h of treatment with conditioned medium derived from NAF and CAF or with control media.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates for NAF, CAF and CTR treated cells were generated by independent treatments and total RNA extractions.
