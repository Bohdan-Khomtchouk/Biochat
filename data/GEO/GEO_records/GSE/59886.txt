TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of ∆scgA at three time points

ORGANISM
Streptomyces chattanoogensis

SUMMARY
In ∆scgA, there were more than 1000 genes displaying at least a two-fold change (P < 0.05), indicating a strong disturbation of gene expression in ZJUD7.

DESIGN
In this study, RNA isolated from ZJUD7 or wild type Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10 was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8,117 protein-coding genes in S. chattanoogensis L10, leading to the successful construction of different expression profiles between which deletion mutant and wild type S. chattanoogensis L10.
