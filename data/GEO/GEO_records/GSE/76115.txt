TITLE
Identification of gene expression changes in rabbit uterus during embryo implantation

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Embryo implantation in the rabbit is unique in that a typical fusion type of implantation is employed, in which trophoblast cells adhere and fuse to the apical surface of uterine epithelial cells. In the present study, we analyzed global gene expression changes in the rabbit uterus during embryo implantation by using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
To systematically identify differentially expressed genes at the implantation site compared to the inter-implantation site.

PLATFORM
