TITLE
Identification of human nephron progenitors capable of generation of kidney structures and functional repair of chronic renal disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NCAM1+ subpopulation of fetal human kidneyl cells are nephron progenitors

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in the NCAM1+ sub-population in comparison to total culture.
