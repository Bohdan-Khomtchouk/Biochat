TITLE
Sox10 Binding Analysis in the Central and Peripheral Nervous System

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of Sox10 in spinal cord and sciatic nerve was performed to determine shared and unique binding sites for Sox10 in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, respectively. Sox10 is required for both Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte development. In addition, differentiation of myelinating glia is dependent upon axonal signaling, so these studies were performed in vivo.

DESIGN
2 independent Sox10 ChIP samples each for spinal cord (CNS) and sciatic nerve (PNS), with respective inputs
