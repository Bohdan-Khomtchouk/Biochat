TITLE
The effects of UV-miRNAs on melanocytes in situ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The response of microRNAs (miRNAs) to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in human melanocytes while in their natural environment, and in particular, melanocytes from persons with a history of melanoma versus those from healthy persons, have yet to be described.  Here, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate and subsequently profile the expression of miRNAs in a pure population of melanocytes from human volunteers exposed to physiological doses of simulated sunlight (ssUVR).  The majority of the UV-responsive miRNAs in the melanocytes of melanoma patients were down-regulated in expression when compared to those in the melanocytes of healthy individuals.  De-repressed genes associated with these down-regulated UV-miRNAs belonged to regulatory modules involved in controlling the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, and immune-evasion, processes reputedly linked to melanoma.

DESIGN
Eight healthy fair-skinned females between the ages of 31 and 38, and nine fair-skinned females with a history of having only one primary melanoma between the ages of 35 to 46, were enrolled in this study to determine the effects of simulated solar ultraviolet radiation (ssUVR) on their melanocytes in situ.
