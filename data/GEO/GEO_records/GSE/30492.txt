TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of a synergistic genetic interaction during carpel margin meristem development in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We are interested in examining the transcriptional hierarchies that are required for proper formation and function of the carpel margin meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana. The carpel margin meristem (CMM) gives rise to the ovule primorida (which begin to form around flower stage 8).  We know that the loss of the seuss-3 (seu-3) and aintegumenta-1(ant-1) separately leads to a mild disruption of ovule formation, while the loss of both causes a complete loss of ovule formation. In this study we wanted to examine expression levels changed between each single mutant and the double mutant. We dissected out stage 8-10 carpel of each of the four genotypes (seu-3, ant-1, Col-0, seu-3 ant-1) pooling 15-25 carpels into one biological replicate. Then using 16 ATH1 arrays we hybridized, amplified and labeled cDNA to 16 arrays (4 replicates for each genotype). We then analyzed our data to reveal transcripts that went down in the double compared to either single mutant, and transcripts that went down more than additively in the double mutant compared to added level of the decrease of the single mutant levels.

DESIGN
16 arrays: 4 seuss-3, 4 aintegumenta-1, 4 Col-0, 4 seuss-3 aintegumenta-1.  Each biological replicate was a sample of 15-25 pooled stage 8-10 carpels manually dissected by hand.
