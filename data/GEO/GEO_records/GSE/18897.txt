TITLE
Whole blood expression profiling of obese diet-sensitive, obese diet-resistant and lean human subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have carried out whole-genome expression profiling of whole blood from obese subjects, defined as obese diet-sensitive and obese diet-resistant, and well matched lean individuals. The diet-sensitive or diet-resistant status refers to the different rates of weight loss observed in the two groups on a low-calorie diet regimen. Bioinformatic analysis revealed alterations in transcription in key pathways that are consistent with impaired capacity for fatty acid oxidation driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis in obese subjects who are resistant to weight loss.

DESIGN
A total of 80 samples are analyzed. This consists of 20 lean subjects studied at one timepoint and 20 obese subjects (10 diet-sensitive and 10 diet-resistant) studied at 3 timepoints during caloric restriction (day of entry into program, week 3 into the program and week 6 into the program)
