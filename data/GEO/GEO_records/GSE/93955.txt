TITLE
In vivo binding of PRDM9 reveals interaction with non-canonical genomic sites

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mouse and human meiosis, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) initiate homologous recombination and occur at specific sites called hotspots. The localization of these sites is determined by the sequence specific DNA binding domain of the PRDM9 histone methyl transferase. Here we performed an extensive analysis of PRDM9 binding in mouse spermatocytes. Unexpectedly, we identified a non-canonical recruitment of PRDM9 to sites which are devoid of both, recombination activity and the PRDM9-binding consensus motif. These sites include transcription promoters, where PRDM9 is recruited in a DSB-dependent manner. Another subset of non-canonical sites also reveals DSB-independent interactions between PRDM9 and genomic sites, which include binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF. We propose that these DSB-independent sites result from interactions between hotspot bound PRDM9 and genomic sequences located on the chromosome axis.
