TITLE
Expression data of LPS-stimulated macrophages from wild-type and Zc3h12a-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand, induces the expression of various genes including proinflammatory cytokines, and the expression is modified by the presence of Zc3h12a. We used microarrays to examine influence of Zc3h12a deficiency in LPS-inducible gene expression. Keywords: Time course after LPS (100 ng/ml) stimulation

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and Zc3h12a-/- mice were stimulated with LPS for 0, 1, 2 and 4 hours, followed by RNA extraction. Then hybridization on affymetrix microarrays was performed.
