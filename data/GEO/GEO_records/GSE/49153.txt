TITLE
Effect of FOXA1 overexpression in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXA1 is a transcription factor which aids AR function in prostate. There is controversary over the effect of high FOXA1 level has on prostate cancer so we forced the overexpression in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.

DESIGN
LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was transfected with GFP control plasmid or plasmid containing FOXA1 full length cDNA. The effect on gene expression was assessed by microarray.
