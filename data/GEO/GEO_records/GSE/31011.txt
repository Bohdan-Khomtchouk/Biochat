TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas

ORGANISM
Crassostrea gigas

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of mRNA from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas

DESIGN
Competent larvae of Crassostrea gigas were treated with epinephrine solution, and then sampled at different time intervals. For shell damage experiment, shell were broken and then tissues were sampled at different time intervals.
