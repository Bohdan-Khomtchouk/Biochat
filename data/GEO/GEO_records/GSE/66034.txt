TITLE
Genome wide analysis of androgen-regulated transcriptional startsites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the AR signaling, we performed CaP analysis of gene expression (CAGE) analysis in AR positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. In addition, we used hormone-refractory prostate cancer model cells, Bicalutamide-resistant (BicR) to explore the differences of androgen signaling in prostate cancer progression.

DESIGN
CAGE analysis of androgen-regulated transcripts in two prostate cancer cells
