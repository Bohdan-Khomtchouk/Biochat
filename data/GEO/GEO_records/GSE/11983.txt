TITLE
Differential control of Zap1-regulated genes in response to zinc deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Zap1 transcription factor is a central player in the response of yeast to changes in zinc status.  Zap1 acts as both a positive and negative regulator of its target genes.  We previously used transcriptome profiling with DNA microarrays to identify 46 potential Zap1 target genes in the yeast genome.  In this study, we have used complementary methods to identify additional Zap1 target genes.  With alternative growth conditions for the microarray experiments and a more sensitive motif identification algorithm, we have identified 31 new potential targets of Zap1 activation. Keywords: Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole genome array

DESIGN
We compared cells overexpressing a constitutive allele of Zap1v.s. vector alone (E3) and wild type strain in severe zinc deficiency v.s.  zinc-replete condition (E4)
