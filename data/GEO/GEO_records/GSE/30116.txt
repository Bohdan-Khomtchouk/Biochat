TITLE
Rosiglitazone-induced molecular changes in adipose progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
White adipose tissue regulates metabolism; the importance of this control is highlighted by the ongoing pandemic of obesity and associated complications such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. White adipose tissue maintenance is a dynamic process, very little is known about how pharmacologic stimuli affect such plasticity. Combining in vivo lineage marking and BrdU labeling strategies, we found that rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class of glucose-lowering medicines, markedly increases the evolution of adipose progenitors into adipocytes. Notably, chronic rosiglitazone administration disrupts the adipogenic and self-renewal capacities of the stem cell compartment and alters its molecular characteristics. These data unravel unknown aspects of adipose dynamics and provide a basis to manipulate the adipose lineage for therapeutic ends. The goal of this gene expression array was to identify changes in molecular expression in adipose progenitors isolated from mice that underwent two-month rosiglitazone treatment.

DESIGN
Adipose SV GFP+ cells (adipose progenitors) were FACS-isolated from adult AdipoTrak mice that had been treated with or without rosiglitazone (0.0075%) for 2 months. RNAs isolated from these cells were used for microarray. Each cohort contains 3-4 mice, each experimental group (-TZD and +TZD) contains 3 cohorts.
