SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of striatum tissue from naive Csnk1e knockout mice and wild-type mice

DESIGN
For this study, 3mm punches from both striatal hemispheres were collected and pooled from 16 mice (8 Csnk1e knockouts, 8 wild-type controls), and RNA was extracted and prepared for cDNA library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq (oligo-dT; 50bp single-end reads). Samples 1-13,and 15-17 were run in four lanes total, with all samples run in L001, and L002 on one flow cell and L001_2 and L002_2 on a second flowcell. Raw samples provided are labeled with the " CB- " prefix, followed by the sample number and the lane that it was run in is described at the tail end as " _L00# " with # being either lane 1 or 2 and _2 denoting lanes on the second flow cell.]
