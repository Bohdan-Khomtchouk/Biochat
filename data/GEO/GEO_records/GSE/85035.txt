TITLE
Copy number analysis by low coverage whole genome sequencing using ultra low-input DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed a cohort of Lifepool IDC cases treated only with wide local excision for genome-wide copy number and loss of heterozygosity using Affymetrix OncoScan® MIP arrays. Cases included IDC (n=4).Benign cases were available for 2 cases. We have analysed copy number calling from the same samples using low-coverage whole genome sequencing in order to investigate the concordance between the two techniques.

DESIGN
4 cases of lifepool  invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 2 benign cases were microdissected from FFPE tissue and analysed by molecular inversion probe (MIP) copy number arrays. The data in this submission are CN values for the ~300,000 probes common to two batches performed.
