TITLE
Identification of p38 beta as a therapeutic target for the treatment of Sézary Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas (CTCL) represent a group of hematopoietic malignancies that home to the skin and have no known molecular basis for disease pathogenesis.  Sézary syndrome (SS) is the leukemic variant of CTCL. Currently, CTCL is incurable, highlighting the need for new therapeutic modalities.  We have previously observed that combined small-molecule inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) β and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) causes synergistic apoptosis in CTCL cell lines and patient cells.  Through microarray analysis of a SS cell line, we surveyed global gene expression following combined PKCβ-GSK3 treatment to elucidate therapeutic targets responsible for cell death. Clinically relevant targets were defined as genes differentially expressed in SS patients that were modulated by combination-drug treatment of SS cells.  Gene set enrichment analysis uncovered candidate genes enriched for an immune cell signature, specifically the T-cell receptor and MAPK signaling pathways.  Further analysis identified p38 as a potential therapeutic target that is over-expressed in SS patients and decreased by synergistic-inhibitor treatment.  This target was verified through small-molecule inhibition of p38 leading to cell death in both SS cell lines and patient cells. These data establish p38 as a new SS biomarker and potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CTCL.

DESIGN
Hut78 cells were treated with 4μM Enzastaurin, 5μM AR-A014418, 4μM Enzastaurin & 5μM AR-A014418, DMSO, or no treatment for three days.  RNA was extracted and hybridized to Illumina microarrays.
