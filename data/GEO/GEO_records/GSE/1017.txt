TITLE
Acute Quadriplegic Myopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AQM shows acute muscle wasting and weakness. Key aspects of AQM include muscle atrophy and myofilament loss. Gene expression profiling, using muscle biopsies from AQM, neurogenic atrophy and normal controls, showed that both myogenic and neurogenic atrophy share induction of myofiber-specific ubiquitin/proteosome pathways while only the AQM shows a specific strong induction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/MAPK pathways.
