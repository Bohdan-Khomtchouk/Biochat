TITLE
Mucus overproduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data demonstrates an increased number of submucosal glands in the sinus mucosa of pediatric patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Additionally, data in the literature indicates differentially altered expression of innate markers of immunity and of inflammatory mediators in the sinus mucosa of adult patients with cystic fibrosis, non-CF controls, and controls. Keywords: Differciation Study

DESIGN
Analyses will focus on inflammatory/immune response genes to identify genes in CRS or CF patients that are involved in pathways that impact on pathogenesis in these diseases. Analysis will also focus on genes in developmental pathways to identify mediators implicated in the development of submucosal glandular hyperplasia in pediatric patients with CRS.
