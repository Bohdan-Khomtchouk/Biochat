TITLE
Transformation of mature adipocytes to liposarcoma in Ad/NICD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) and liposarcoma (LPS) isolated from Notch1 overexpression mice (Ad/NICD). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenic transformation of Ad/NICD mature adipocytes

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Ad/N1ICD WAT vs. Ad/N1ICD LPS. Biological replicates: 4 Ad/N1ICD WAT and 8 Ad/N1ICD LPS

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
