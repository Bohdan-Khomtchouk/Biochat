TITLE
Gene expression by Retinoic Acid in mouse Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine and clarify the retinoic effect on the gene expression profile for mouse dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Dendritic cells were prepared from marrow cells by culturing them for 10 days with GM-CSF (20 ng/ml). These cells were cultured with the following reagents from the beginning of the culture: Two groups of dendritic cell conditions (Control, all-trans-retinoic acid (10 nmol) and Ro41-5253 (100 nmol)) with and without LPS(1 ug/ml).  The above conditions were done in BALB/c and BL6 mouse strains and compared for reproducible gene expression.
