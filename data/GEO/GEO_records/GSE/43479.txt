TITLE
Gene expression profiling of γ34.5 deleted HSV1 infected Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of wild type and STING knock-out Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with γ34.5 deleted HSV1. Genes whose expression that are affected by HSV1 in a STING dependent manner will be identified and signaling pathways regulated by STING will be elucidated.

DESIGN
Primary MEFs were mock treated or infected with γ34.5 deleted HSV1 at M.O.I. 1. Total RNA was extracted 3 hours post infection for array analysis.
