TITLE
Genome wide evidence of Austronesian-Bantu admixture and cultural reversion in a hunter-gatherer group of Madagascar

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Linguistic and cultural evidence suggests that Madagascar was the final point of two major dispersals of Austronesian and Bantu speaking populations. Today, Mikea are described as the last known Malagasy population reported to be still practising a hunter-gatherer life-style. It is unclear, however, whether Mikea descend from a remnant population that existed before the arrival of Austronesian and Bantu agriculturalists or whether it is only their life-style that separates them from the other contemporary populations of South Madagascar. In order to address these questions we have performed a genome wide analysis of > 700,000 SNP markers on 21 Mikea, 24 Vezo and 24 Temoro individuals together with 50 individuals from Bajo and Lebbo populations from Indonesia. Our analyses of these data in the context of data available from other Southeast Asian and African populations reveal that all three Malagasy populations are derived from the same admixture event involving Austronesian and Bantu sources. In contrast to the fact that most of the vocabulary of the Malagasy speakers is derived from the Barito group of the Austronesian language family we observe that only one third of their genetic ancestry is related to the populations of Java-Kalimantan-Sulawesi area. Because no additional ancestry components distinctive to for the Mikea were found, it is likely that they have adopted their hunter-gatherer way of life by through cultural reversion.
