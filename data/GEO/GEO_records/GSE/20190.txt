TITLE
Transcriptional properties of the endometrial macrophage in the pregnant cow

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of bovine CD14+ cells comparing endometrial CD14+ cell with blood CD14+ cells from the same pregnant cow . Enzymatically dispersed stromal endometrial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same cow were labelled using CD14 antibody as a maker.  The labeling with CD14 makes possible the soring of those CD14 cells by FACS. Goal was to determine the effects of pregnancy and the location of CD14+ on global CD14+ cells gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, endometrial vs. blood CD14+ cells. Biological replicates: 4 pairs of blood and endometrial CD14+ cells from each pregnant cow.
