TITLE
Expression data from targeting of NOS2 in glioma stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of targeting NOS2 at the gene expression level. Our studies demonstrated a role for NOS2 in glioma biology through the maintenance of the glioma stem cell phenotype. Microarray results provide novel targets of NOS2 and suggest mechanisms through which NOS2 contributes to glioma stem cell biology.

DESIGN
Glioma stem cells isolated from two different human glioma xenografts were infected with a non-targeting control shRNA or two different shRNAs directed against NOS2 (each treatment in each tumor performed in technical duplicates).
