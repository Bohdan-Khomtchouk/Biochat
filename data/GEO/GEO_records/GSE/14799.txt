TITLE
Transcriptional dosage compensation in heterozygotes for deletions in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We measured gene expression in two isogenic Drosophila lines heterozygous for long deletions. We find that a majority of genes are at least partially compensated at transcription for ½-fold dosage. The degree of compensation does not vary among functional classes of genes. Compensation for deletions is stronger for highly expressed genes than for genes with low expression level. In contrast, the degree of compensation for duplications observed in Gupta et al, 2006, (J. of Biology 5, 3) data for heterozygotes for a duplication is stronger for weakly expressed genes. Thus, transcriptional compensation appears to be based on general regulatory mechanisms that insure high levels of transcription some genes and low transcription levels of other genes, instead of precise maintenance of a particular homeostatic expression level. Given the ubiquity of transcriptional compensation, dominance of wild-type alleles may be at least partially caused by of the regulation at transcription level.

DESIGN
Two DrosDel [34] Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines, Df(3L)ED4475 and Df(3L)ED4543, heterozygous for long deletions on 3L chromosomal branch both maintained against the TM6C balancer were used for microarray experiment. Twenty five adult flies 2-5 days after eclosion were frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA extraction by Trizol method (Invitrogen ®, Carlsbad, CA) in twelve replicates from each line. The two deletion lines served as controls to each other.
