TITLE
root hair-expressed genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identifiy root hair-preferred genes in rice, we perform microarray using root hairs sample from don-gin and lon-gin cultivar

DESIGN
After sterilizing, seeds of rice were placed on an MSO medium during 3 day. The seminal roots were detached and submerged in liquid nitrogen and then gently were rubbed to purify root hairs
