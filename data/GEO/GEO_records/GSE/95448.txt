TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of 312 basal epithelial cells from the mammary glands of pregnant and adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary glands were collected from 8 pregnant (12.5 day) mice and 8 adult (10 week old) female mice. Basal epithelial cells were FACS sorted. Freshly sorted cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. Cells were visualized under the microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to achieve paired-end 75 bp reads.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiling was completed for 75 cells from pregnant mice and 237 cells from adult mice.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
