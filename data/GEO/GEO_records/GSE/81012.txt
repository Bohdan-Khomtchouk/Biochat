TITLE
Expression data from mouse hair follicle stem cells at postnatal day 49 in K14-sPLA2-IIA and wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
sPLA2-IIA is involved in lipid catabolism and is deregulated in various human cancers. Our data showed that over expression of sPLA2-IIA in skin disrupts various epidermal lineages, loss of ortho-parakeratotic organization, stem cell depletion/quiescence and increased differentiation potentially associated with global differences in epigenetic status. Our study has provided significant contribution to over existing knowledge of sPLA2-IIA by showing the unexplored role of sPLA2-IIA in hair follicle stem cells and skin homeostasis mediated through JNK/c-Jun signaling mechanism. We have performed microarray analysis  on hair follicle stem cells in K14-sPLA2-IIA mice to uncover the global  gene expression profile underlying stem cell regulation and tissue homeostasis, and have shown the distinct classes of up-regulated genes involved during this process.

DESIGN
To understand the molecular mechanism, we performed the genome-wide expression profiling of hair follicle stem cells in K14-sPLA2-IIA (TG) and wild type (WT) mice. CD34+ Î±6-intergrin+ (Hair follicle stem cells) were FACS isolated  for RNA extraction and further performed the hybridization by using the mice GeneChip(R) Mouse Gene 2.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, USA).
