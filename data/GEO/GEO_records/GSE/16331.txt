TITLE
CD6 co-stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Difference in gene expression profile between 30000 freshly isolated human PBMCs stimulated with the immobilized anti-CD3 mAb (0.25µg/ml) alone (lane 1), along with ALCAM-Fc (1µg/ml) (lane 2), IL-2 (2.5ng/ml) (lane 4) or both (lane 3) or compared to unstimulated cells (lane 5), incubated for 72 h.

DESIGN
Organism used: Human Slides: Human 8x15k Arrays Starting material: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells RNA Samples used: Pooled 1 – Unstimulated, Anti-CD3, Anti-CD3 + IL-2, Anti-CD3 + ALCAM, Anti-CD3 +ALCAM + IL-2. Labeling kit: Agilent’s Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0444) Labeling Method: T7 promoter based-linear amplification to generate labeled complementary RNA   (One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis) Total RNA and cRNA Purification Kit: Hybridization Kit: Qiagen’s RNeasy minikit Cat#74104 RNA quality was checked using Bioanalyzer.
