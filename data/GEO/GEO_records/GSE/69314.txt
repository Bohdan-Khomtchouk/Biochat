TITLE
Global analysis of mouse polyomavirus infection reveals dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used deep sequencing to follow polyomavirus infection of mouse NIH3T6 cells.  We carried out RNA-seq at various times after infection and analyzed the host transcriptomes.  Alignment of sequencing reads to the host genome showed that by late times in infection, 359 host transcripts were seen to be upregulated and 857 were downregulated more than 1.5 fold.

DESIGN
Infect NIH 3T6 cells with the Py59RA strain of polyomavirus at an MOI of 50 and harvest RNA from 12, 18, 24, 36 hours from infected and mock samples to compare host transcription.
