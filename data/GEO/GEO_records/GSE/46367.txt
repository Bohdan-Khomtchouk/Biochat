TITLE
Transcriptional profiles in rat hair follicles after single wave blasting impact

ORGANISM
Rattus rattus

SUMMARY
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (350 - 400 g) were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane for 3 min in a closed induction chamber.  A helium driven shock tube was used at various shock wave pressures (20 - 30 psi).  The exposure system has been developed so that the animals are exposed head only to a ?primary blast? that being a single pulse shock wave with only minimal concussive and whiplash effects.  After exposure, rats were closely observed for either 1 day or 7 days before being sacrificed.  At the end of the observation period, rat whiskers were quickly pulled and placed in a 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of RNAlater.  Samples were then stored at -80C until further analysis.

DESIGN
There were 3 control rats and 5 treated rats.
