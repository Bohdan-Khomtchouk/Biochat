TITLE
global gene expression profiling experiments of HSC cultured in cysteine or valine deficient medium by RNA-sequencing analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of amino acid to maintain HSC function. To identify essential amino acids for HSCs, CD34-KSL cells were cultured in single amino acids deficient medium. And cultured cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. Then, the donor chimerism and lineage contribution was estimated. Surprisingly, HSC proliferation was prevented in valine and cysteine deficient medium in vitro. Donor cells cultured in these medium were also not engrafted. To elucidate the effects and influences of cysteine and valine in HSCs, we performed global gene expression profiling experiments by RNA-sequencing analysis. Gene sets categorized with cell cycle, mitosis, cell division or DNA replication were strongly down-regulated in both valine- or cysteine-depleted conditions These results imply distinctive amino-acid metabolism involved in HSC division.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of ten thousand HSCs cultured in cysteine or valine deficient medium for 24 hours were compared with that of HSCs cultured in complete medium by using RNA-sequencing analysis
