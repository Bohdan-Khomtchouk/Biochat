TITLE
Comparison of fire ant adult queens with different supergene genotypes (SB/SB and SB/Sb) and different age classes (1-day-old virgins, 11-day-old virgins and reproductive queens) from 2008 and 2009

ORGANISM
Solenopsis invicta

SUMMARY
In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, a colony queen number is determined by the founding queen's genotypes at the 13 Mb supergene with the non-recombining variants SB and Sb. Single-queen colonies are always headed by SB/SB queens while multiple-queens colonies are always headed by SB/Sb queens. The two variants of the supergene, SB and Sb are completely linked to the two alleles (B and b) of the gene Gp-9. SB/SB and SB/Sb queens differ in many physiological traits including their maturation rate and odor. To explain why SB/SB and SB/Sb queens have different odors, and why SB/SB virgins mature faster and accumulate more fat, we measured expression of ~6000 genes in virgin queens 1 and 11 days after eclosion and in reproductive queens.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment: 1-day-old SB/SB virgins, 1-day-old SB/Sb virgins, 11-day-old SB/SB virgins, 11-day-old SB/Sb virgins, SB/SB reproductive queens, SB/Sb reproductive queens. Biological replicates: 8 for 1-day-old SB/SB virgins and 1-day-old SB/Sb virgins that were collected in 2008; 8 for 1-day-old SB/SB virgins, 1-day-old SB/Sb virgins that were collected in 2009; 7 for 11-day-old SB/SB virgins and 11-day-old SB/Sb virgins that were collected in 2008; 8 for 11-day-old SB/SB virgins and 11-day-old SB/Sb virgins that were collected in 2009; 8 for SB/SB and SB/Sb reproductive queens (only collected in 2009). Samples were labeled with Cy3 and were compared to the same common reference RNA labeled with Cy5. Samples from 2008 were hybridized on the microarrays batch I and samples from 2009 were hybridized on the microarrays batch J.
