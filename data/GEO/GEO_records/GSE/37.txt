TITLE
BYxwild_40

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of F1 haploid segregants from a cross between BY4716 (isogenic to S288c) and a wild isolate collected by R. Mortimer.  Each segregant sample was subjected to a dye-swap pair of arrays.  All arrays used the same pool of reference BY4716 sample.  In sample titles, " BY " alone signifies the reference sample and all other strings represent segregants.  All sample titles are of the form S1-S2.  S1 indicates the sample whose signal was read as channel 1 (Cy5 labeling, fluorescence at 635 nm) and S2 as channel 2 (Cy3, 532 nm). Keywords: repeat sample
