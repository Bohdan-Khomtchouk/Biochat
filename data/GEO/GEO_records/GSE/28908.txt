TITLE
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) strain M600 wild type transcriptome ChIP-chip with the bldC null mutant

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
Global regulation by the Streptomyces coelicolor atypical MerR-like transcription factor BldC. BldC is a transcriptional regulator essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor. Here we identify the BldC regulon by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray analysis. The BldC regulon encompasses at least 201 transcriptional units, which include many genes that play key roles in Streptomyces development (e.g., bldC itself, bldB, bldM, whiB, whiD, whiI, sigF, smeA-sffA, hupS), antibiotic production (e.g., afsK) and stress response (e.g., clpB, nsrR, sigE, sigF). All BldC-binding sites identified by ChIP-chip are present in the promoters of the target genes. In vitro DNA-binding experiments show that BldC is capable of binding DNA specifically in the absence of other proteins and suggest that BldC is a minor-groove DNA-binding protein. The regulon of BldC partially overlaps with that of the pleiotropic regulator BldD. BldC and BldD bind to distinct sites in the promoter region of smeA, where they simultaneously repress its transcription.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip experiment using an anti-BldC antibody and a total DNA control. Comparison of IP in wild-type strain vs. IP in a bldC null mutant strain.
