TITLE
Microarray analysis of the gene expression profile and lipid metabolism in fat-1 transgenic cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression profile and the mechanism of lipid metabolism in fat-1 transgenic cattle, and accumulate important basic data required to obtain more efficient fat-1 transgenic cattle. Using data obtained from microarray analysis, transcriptome profiling of fat-1 transgenic and wild type cattle identified differentially expressed genes involved in 90 biological pathways, eight of which were related to lipid metabolism processes, which included 36 genes related to lipid metabolism. This analysis also identified 11 significantly enriched genes that were involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway. These findings were verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The information obtained in this study indicated that the introduction of an exogenous fat-1 gene into cattle affects the gene expression profile and the process of lipid metabolism in these animals.

DESIGN
Three transgenic and three wild type cattle were selected for the microarray analysis, and then this results were validated by real-time PCR.
