TITLE
The expression profiling comparison of mice with Scap and Insig deletion from perinatal lung (E17.5-PN1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we studied the genomic responses of  the Insig and Scap deletion from perinatal lung. Through comprehensive data analysis and integration, time dependent effects of epithelial SCAP/INSIG/SREBP deletion and defined SCAP/INSIG/SREBP-associated genes, bioprocesses and downstream pathways were identified.

DESIGN
Total lung RNA was isolated from ScapΔ/Δ, Insig1/2Δ/Δ, and respective control littermates at E17.5, E18.5 and PN1 were used for mRNA expression profiling analysis (n=3 for each condition)
