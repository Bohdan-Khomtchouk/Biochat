TITLE
Human embryonic stem cells in E8 and AKIT culture medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated KhES-1 human embryonic stem cells in growth factors-dependent (E8) and -independent (AKIT) culture medium. Results provide insight into genes differentially expressed in pluripotent states maintained by AKIT and E8 culture medium.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of KhES-1 human ES cells mainteined in AKIT culture medum (3 replicates) compare to that in control E8 medium (3 replicates).
