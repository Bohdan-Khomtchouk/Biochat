TITLE
Effect of somatostatin knockout on sexually dimorphic hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The liver is one of the most sexually dimorphic organs as measured by gene expression differences. About 80% of the sexually dimorphic genes are known to be regulated by growth hormone (GH). Somatostatin (SST) inhibits the release of GH. We generated a SST-knockout mouse and analyzed the hepatic gene expression changes in both sexes.

DESIGN
We used liver samples from three mice of both sexes and somatostatin genotypes. Mouse background was C57BL/6.
