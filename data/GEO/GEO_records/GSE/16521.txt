TITLE
GATA-2 controls megakaryocyte proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Downregulation of GATA-2 in megakaryocytic cells G1ME caused cell cycle arrest. To identify GATA-2 target genes, we transduced G1ME cells with control vector or a vector expressing shRNA specific for mouse GATA-2. The transduced cells were purified by sorting and the RNA were used for microarry.

DESIGN
We performed experiments for three times. Each group had three samples.
