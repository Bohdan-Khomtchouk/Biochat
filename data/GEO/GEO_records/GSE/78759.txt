TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of two ethanol-tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae clones obtained by evolutionary engineering

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Evolutionary engineering strategy was used for selection of ethanol-tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae clones under gradually increasing ethanol stress levels. Clones B2 and B8 were selected based on their higher ethanol-tolerance and higher ethanol production levels. Whole genome microarray analysis was used for identifying the gene expression levels of these two evolved clones compared to the reference strain.

DESIGN
Two evolved ethanol-tolerant strains B2 and B8, which were selected by evolutionary engineering under gradually increasing ethanol stress, were used for whole genome transcriptomic analysis in comparison with the reference strain. Cells were grown in yeast minimal media until they reach a final OD600 of 1. Following total RNA isolation, gene expression levels were analyzed using One-color microarray-based gene expression analysis (Agilent Technologies). Experiments were done in triplicates.
