TITLE
Genome wide Affymetric Microarray analysis for RIPK1 dependent inflammatory changes in Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene level expression estimate using the Whole Transcript (WT) Assay approach of the Gene 1.0 ST Array System for Mouse. This assay was done to identify the RIPK1-dependent gene expression changes in mouse BMDMs. Cost-effective gene-level analysis based on whole-transcript coverage.

DESIGN
We analyzed Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) under 4 different conditions (Control, LPS, LPS/zVAD, LPS/zVAD/Nec-1) to assess inflammatory changes in RIPK1 kinase dependent manner compared to LPS, LPS/zVAD plus RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 and control.
