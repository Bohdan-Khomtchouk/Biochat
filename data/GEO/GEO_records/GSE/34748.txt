TITLE
Intragraft Gene Expression in Positive Crossmatch Kidney Allografts:  Ongoing Inflammation Mediates Chronic Antibody-Mediated Injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied intragraft gene expression profiles of positive crossmatch (+XM) kidney transplant recipients who develop transplant glomerulopathy (TG) and those who do not.  Whole genome microarray analysis and quantitative rt-PCR for 30 transcripts were performed on RNA from protocol renal allograft biopsies in 3 groups: 1) +XM/TG+ biopsies before and after TG; 2) +XM/NoTG; and 3) negative crossmatch kidney transplants (control).  Microarray comparisons showed few differentially expressed genes between paired biopsies from +XM/TG+ recipients before and after the diagnosis of TG.  Comparing +XM/TG+ and control groups, significantly altered expression was seen for 2,447 genes (18%) and 3,200 genes (24%) at early and late time points, respectively.  Canonical pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes showed inflammatory genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses.  Comparing +XM/TG+ and +XM/NoTG groups, 3,718 probe sets were differentially expressed but these were over-represented in only 4 pathways.  A classic accommodation phenotype was not identified.  Using rt-PCR, the expression of inflammatory genes was significantly increased in +XM/TG+ recipients compared to control biopsies and to +XM/NoTG biopsies.  In conclusion, pre-transplant DSA results in a gene expression profile characterized by inflammation and cellular infiltration and the majority of XM+ grafts are exposed to chronic injury.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression from 2 groups of positive crossmatch kidney transplant recipients (+XM/TG+ and +XM/TG-).  Patients in the +XM/TG+ group had 2 biopsies - prior to the development of transplant glomerulopathy on biopsy (Biopsy 1; cg=0; n=10) and after development of transplant glomerulopathy (Biopsy 2; cg > 0; n=10).  The +XM/TG- patients had only a Biopsy 2 (cg=0; n=11).  A third patient group served as controls (n=10) and were from -XM recipients.
