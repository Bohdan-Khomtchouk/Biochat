TITLE
Expression data from cardiac CD11c+MHC II+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously reported that a synthetic Nod1 ligand, FK565, induced coronary arteritis in mice similar to Kawasaki disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this site-specific inflammation have remained elusive. In this study, we found that CD11c+MHC class II+ cells accumulated in the heart of FK565-treated mice prior to arteritis development. We used microarray analysis to detail gene expression of CD11c+MHC class II+ cells.

DESIGN
To obtain gene expression profile of CD11c+MHC class II+ cells, we isolated these cells from hearts of FK565-treated mice. Briefly, female mice at 8weeks age were administered 500 μg of FK565 subcutaneously at day 0 and day 3. At day6, murine hearts were removed and digested with collagenase. CD11c+MHC II+ cells were sorted as PI–CD45+Ly6G–NK1.1–CD11b+CD11c+MHC II+ using FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were subjected to RNA preparation. Two independent replicates from ten mice were made.
