TITLE
SOX2 promoter 4C-seq of H9-hESC derived human neural stem cells with mutant IDH1-R132H overexpression, P53 shRNA knockdown and ATRX shRNA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
4C-seq was performed to assess genomic contacts with the SOX2 protmoter, human neural stem cells with no oncogenic alterations were compared to those with concurrent IDH1-R132H overexpression, P53 shRNA knockdown and ATRX shRNA knockdown.

DESIGN
4C-seq was performed in duplicates, there are two conditions total. Vector NSCs are the control line and have an empty mCherry vector and a scramble shRNA vector. Three-hit NSCs express mutant-IDH1, P53 knockdown and ATRX knockdown.

PLATFORM
