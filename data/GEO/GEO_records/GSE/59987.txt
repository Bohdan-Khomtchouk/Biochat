TITLE
TET1 regulates hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition through DNA demethylation (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to explore the status of DNA methylation in hypoxia response, we show that TET1, a DNA dioxygenase converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), regulates hypoxia-responsive gene expression. Hypoxia/HIF-2Î± regulates the expression of TET1. Knockdown of TET1 mitigated hypoxia-induced EMT. RNA sequencing and 5hmC sequencing identified the set of TET1-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Four samples (Four samples, Hypoxia (scrambled control), Hypoxia (TET1-si), Normoxia (scrambled control) and Normoxia (TET1-si), are performed by RNA-Seq and hMeDIP-Seq  RNA-Seq and hMeDIP-Seq
