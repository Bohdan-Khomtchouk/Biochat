TITLE
Rat lung cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat somatic lung cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave the rat somatic lung cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the rat iPS cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between rat somatic lung cells and rat iPS cells.

DESIGN
There were two replicates sample of the rat somatic lung cell  named 1, 2.And the control cells were the mixture of rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF) named mix1. Rat somatic lung cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the mix1 were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the rat somatic lung cells' gene expression difference compared with that of mix1.
