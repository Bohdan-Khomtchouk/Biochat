TITLE
Overexpression of TREM2 in human gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of TREM2 in gastric cancer, deep sequencing to profile global gene expression of MGC-803 cells with TREM2 overexpression was performed.

DESIGN
To investigate the biological role of TREM2 in gastric cancer, MGC-803 cells with stable overexpression of TREM2 were established. Then deep sequencing to profile global gene expression of MGC-803 cells with TREM2 overexpression was performed.
