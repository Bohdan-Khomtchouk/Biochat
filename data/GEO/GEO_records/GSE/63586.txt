TITLE
Deep sequencing and analysis of small RNAs from Nt-Xanthi and CMV delta 2b-infected Nt-Xanthi

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
To investigate if CMV infection might affect the accumulation of sat-like RNAs, sRNA isolated from Nt-Xanthi and Nt-Xanthi infected with SD-CMVdeltasatRNA were sequenced.

DESIGN
sRNA sequencing was employed to identify the different of the sRNA between Nt-Xanthi and Nt-Xanthi infected with SD-CMVdeltasatRNA
