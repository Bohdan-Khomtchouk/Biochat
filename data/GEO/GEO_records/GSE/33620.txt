TITLE
The downstream gene expression of AnxA4 in AGS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AnxA4 expression is increased in H. pylori associated tumors. Moreover, in renal-cell cancer, AnxA4 increases tumor cell dissemination and promotes cell migration, and in colorectal cancer, it is identified as a potential diagnostic marker. How AnxA4 might be involved in tumorgenesis has remained unclear. Here, we compared the gene expression profiles between the cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (+)/AnxA4 and control (empty vector) to study the downstream genes of AnxA4 using Exon array technique.

DESIGN
Four samples are analyzed.

PLATFORM
