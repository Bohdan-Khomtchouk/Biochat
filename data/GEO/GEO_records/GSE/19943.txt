TITLE
MicroRNAs expression profiling of human nucleus pulposus cells: control vs. degeneration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs expression profiling of human nucleus pulposus cells derived from patients with disc degeneration in comparison with those derived from patients with scoliosis as control.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control nucleus pulposus cells vs. degenerative nucleus pulposus cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 degenerated, independently harvested. Four replicates per array. The supplementary file 'GSE19943_fold_pvalue.txt' contains fold-changes and p-values.
