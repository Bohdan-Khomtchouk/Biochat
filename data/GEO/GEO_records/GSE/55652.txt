TITLE
The transcriptome of lae1 mutants of Trichoderma reesei cultivated at constant growth rates reveals new targets of LAE1 function

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
We used three biological replicas of  T. reesei (QM9414), a Î”lae1 mutant and a lae1-overexpressing strain in the chemostat on glucose at two different growth rates (0.075 and 0.020 h-1).

DESIGN
Two to four subsequently achieved, independent steady-states were sampled and analysed for each dilution rate and fungal strain.
