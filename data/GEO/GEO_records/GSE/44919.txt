TITLE
Control of Reproductive Floral Organ Identity Specification in Arabidopsis by the C Function Regulator AGAMOUS (expression)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Characterization of the activities of the transcription factor that AG encodes throughout flower development using perturbation assays in combination with a floral induction system (FIS) that allows a stage-specific analysis of flower development. The series contains static perturbation experiments (null allele ag-1), and amiRNA knockdown experiments.

DESIGN
Two conditions (i.e. perturbation experiments of ag-1 homozygous in the FIS vs ag-1 heterozygous in the FIS across three developmental stages. amiRNA knockdown experiments induced amiRNA expression vs. uninduced.
