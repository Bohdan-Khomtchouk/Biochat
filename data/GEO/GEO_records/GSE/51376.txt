TITLE
Expression analysis of wild-type and transcription factor mutants in response to rapamycin

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcript level changes in transcription factor mutants after rapamycin treatment, compared to the wild-type strain. This data set accompanies the study " Widespread Misinterpretable ChIP-seq Bias in Yeast " (GSE51251)

DESIGN
Four separate wild-type cultures of yeast were grown, and each culture was split into two. Then, one was treated with DMSO and the other one was treated with rapamycin. For transcription factor mutants, two separate cultures were grown, and rapamycin was treated in the same way as treated to the wild type. Total RNA was recovered from each culture, then labeled oligo was prepared following NimbleGene standard protocol. Each chip measures the expression levels of 5,777 genes from yeast.
