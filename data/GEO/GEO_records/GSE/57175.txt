TITLE
Sequence selectivity of macrolide-induced translational regulation

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
We sequenced a total of 12 cDNA libararies derived from fragmented total mRNA and ribosome protected mRNAs from azithromycin-treated and -untreated S. aureus samples. The data represented 2 independent biological replicates.

DESIGN
Examination of the impact of azithromycin on global translatome, mRNA abundance and the ribosome density along the transcripts.
