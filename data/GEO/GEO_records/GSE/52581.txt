TITLE
An Immunosignature system for diagnosis of cancer [Cancer immunosignaturing - test 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains peptide array information from 1516 patients from 12 different cancer types, 2 infectious diseases, and healthy controls using leave one out cross validation.  This array is library 2 (GPL14921).

DESIGN
A 1:500 dilution of human serum is added to a peptide array (GPL14921).  This array is a one-up design, with 10286 peptides printed in duplicate on a standard glass microscope slide.  1516 patients samples from 14 different diseases and 1 control cohort were analyzed

PLATFORM
