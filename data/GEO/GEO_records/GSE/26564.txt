TITLE
Genomewide occupancy of the synovial sarcoma-associated SYT-SSX2 oncoprotein in C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignancy that is characterized by the presence of a chromosomal translocation t(X;18).  This genetic abnormality results in the fusion of 2 transcriptional co-regulators, SYT and SSX, which have been shown to mediate transcriptional activation and repression, respectively.  Although the fusion protein does not bind DNA directly, SYT-SSX2 is known to function through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes.  In this study, we wanted to determine the SYT-SSX2 occupancy across the whole genome in order to further characterize its function by identifying genes that may be deregulated by this protein.

DESIGN
C2C12 myoblasts were infected with retrovirus carrying SYT-SSX2-HA-FLAG expression vector.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed on cell lysates with either control IgG antibody (Abcam) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).  Lysates from 2 independent infections were pooled and used to isolate control ChIP DNA (IgG).  DNA from 2 independent FLAG ChIP experiments (each using lysates from 2 independent infections) was pooled for SYT-SSX2 ChIP.
