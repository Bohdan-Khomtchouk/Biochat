TITLE
Genomewide occupancy of the synovial sarcoma-associated SYT-SSX2 oncoprotein in C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignancy that is characterized by the presence of a chromosomal translocation t(X;18).  This genetic abnormality results in the fusion of 2 transcriptional co-regulators, SYT and SSX, which have been shown to mediate transcriptional activation and repression, respectively.  Although the fusion protein does not bind DNA directly, SYT-SSX2 is known to function through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes.  In this study, we wanted to determine the SYT-SSX2 occupancy across the whole genome in order to further characterize its function by identifying genes that may be deregulated by this protein.
