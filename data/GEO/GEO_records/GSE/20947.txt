TITLE
Identification of miRNAs involved in embyonic chicken muscle development

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In the current study, we expanded our previous work to identify miRNAs implicated in the myogenesis regulation through the comparison of miRNAs transcriptome in skeletal muscle tissues between broilers and layers.

DESIGN
miRNA expression studies of two different intra-species breeds

PLATFORM
GPL10225 Peking University Chicken miRNA 4k array
