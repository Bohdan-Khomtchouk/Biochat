TITLE
Gene expression changes in greenhouse Hebeloma cylindrosporum-Pinus pinaster ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to Hebeloma cylindrosporum free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Hebeloma cylindrosporum

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum ectomycorrhizal root tips compared to free-living mycelium . Ectomycorrhizal root tips  were harvested after 6 months and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 100 bp were generated and aligned to Hebeloma cylindrosporum transcripts ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Hebcy2 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Hebeloma cylindrosporum ectomycorrhizal root tips and  free-living mycelium were generated by Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing (100bp). Ttwo biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.

PLATFORM
