TITLE
Exploration of PRC2 sigal at gene promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Performed H3K27me3 ChIP-chip analysis to defien genomic regions with this mark, which indicates the presence of the PRC2 complex

DESIGN
Untreated SW-13 adrenocortical carcinoma cells were lysed and ChIP analysis was performed to pull down H3K27me3 labelled chromatin. Purified DNA of that chromatin was hybridized to Agilent ChIP arrays. This experiment was repeated 3 times.
