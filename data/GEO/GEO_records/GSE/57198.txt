TITLE
Expression data from HEK wild-type cells treated with geneticin (16uM) or left untreated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to study the cellular response to aminoglycoside-induced mistranslation, we used a whole-genome microarray analysis of geneticin-treated versus untreated cells, which revealed a broad transcriptional response totaling 705 genes.

DESIGN
comparison of four geneticin treated biological replicates with four untreated biological replicates (selected for a fold change > 1.2, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05)

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
