TITLE
Mouse kidney after systemic endotoxin challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
8 week-old male C57BL6J mice were given Gram-negative endotoxin (LPS O111:B4, 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally at time 0.  18 hrs thereafter, they were administered 10 ml/kg 0.9% saline.  Mice were sacrificed at 0, 18, or 42 hrs after LPS challenge. Kidneys were immediately collected into TRIzol for RNA preparation. Renal function was measured on blood collected at the time of tissue harvest At t=0hr, mice had normal baseline renal function. At t=18hr, mice exhibited early renal injury, At t=42hr, mice had either recovered normal renal function or had persistent renal injury. We collected  kidneys from 3 mice per time point.  For the 42 hr time point, we collected kidneys from 3 mice with recovered renal function and kidneys from 3 mice with persistent renal injury.

DESIGN
Mouse kidneys selected at successive stages of renal injury and recovery following systemic LPS challenge and volume resuscitation following LPS challenge.
