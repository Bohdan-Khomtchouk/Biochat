TITLE
Differential expression of miRNAs in the GW627368X and PGE2 induced exosomes

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small membrane bound cell-derived vesicles that are present in biological fluids include blood and cell culture medium. Exosomes contain various functional proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). We used miRNA microarrays to detail the miRNA content in the GW627368-induced and PGE2-induced exosomes from non-adherent mammary epithelial cells (NAMECs).
