TITLE
Differential expression of miRNAs in the GW627368X and PGE2 induced exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small membrane bound cell-derived vesicles that are present in biological fluids include blood and cell culture medium. Exosomes contain various functional proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). We used miRNA microarrays to detail the miRNA content in the GW627368-induced and PGE2-induced exosomes from non-adherent mammary epithelial cells (NAMECs).

DESIGN
GW627368X and PGE2 induced-exosomes were collected from NAMECs culture medium for miRNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® miRNA 3.0 array.

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
