TITLE
Early and late passage endothelial cells with or without PDCD10 downregulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary cells deficient for PDCD10/CCM3 do not enter senescence as control cells. Microarray analysis was performed in cells transduced with non-targeting shRNA and CCM3 shRNA at passage 7 (early passage) and passage 11 (late passage), when control cells are already senescent.

DESIGN
Primary endothelial cells were transduced either with non-target shRNA or with CCM3 shRNA. RNA was extracted at passage 7 and passage 11
