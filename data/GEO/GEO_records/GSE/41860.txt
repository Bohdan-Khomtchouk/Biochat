TITLE
Time-course expression data during assurance of the chronological longevity by caloric restriction in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention to retard aging and increase longevity in a variety of species. It is important to understand the fundamental mechanism by which CR extends lifespan that remains elusive. Owing to well-established genomic tools and convenience of culture system, we used a single cell organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to clarify the mechanisms of CR. In order to identify genes responsible for CR-mediated longevity, we performed microarray experiments across the longevity assurance time-points.
