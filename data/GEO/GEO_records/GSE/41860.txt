TITLE
Time-course expression data during assurance of the chronological longevity by caloric restriction in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention to retard aging and increase longevity in a variety of species. It is important to understand the fundamental mechanism by which CR extends lifespan that remains elusive. Owing to well-established genomic tools and convenience of culture system, we used a single cell organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to clarify the mechanisms of CR. In order to identify genes responsible for CR-mediated longevity, we performed microarray experiments across the longevity assurance time-points.

DESIGN
Since the CR-treated cells obtained the longevity potential around 12 hours after inoculation and the strength of potential gradually increased up to 48 hours, we concluded that the changes across these time-points must be a critical need for assurance of longevity by CR. For preparation of total RNA, yeast cells under control (2% glucose) and CR (0.5% glucose) conditions were harvested at 12h, 18h, 24h and 48h after inoculation. After total RNA extraction, we performed Affymetrix Yeast GeneChip 2.0 array for biological triplicate repeats according to the manufacturer's instructions.
