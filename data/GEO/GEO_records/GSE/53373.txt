TITLE
Gene expression regulation in canine mammary neoplastic cells by MDSC

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The changes in gene expression of canine mammary neoplastic cells due to co-culture with myeloid-derived suppressor cells were assesed.

DESIGN
Dye-swap experiment, gene expression in canine mammary neoplastic cells co-cultured with MDSC was compared to neoplastic cells monoculture.
