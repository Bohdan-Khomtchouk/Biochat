TITLE
Gene expression in mouse primary pre-B cells transduced with Ikaros

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ikaros family DNA binding proteins are critical regulators of B cell development. To identify Ikaros-regulated genes in primary pre-B cells we performed gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
We used retroviral gene transfer to express Ikaros proteins. Total RNA from 3 biological replicates of primary pre-B cells transduced with wild type Ikaros (HA-Ikaros-IRES-GFP) and control vector (IRES-GFP) was isolated 48h after infection.
