TITLE
Micro-array analysis of the anterior vaginal wall from premenopausal patients with Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common multifactorial disease in a heterogeneous population of women. Due to this heterogeneity, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of POP are still unclear. We sought to identify dysregulated pathways by comparing gene expression profiles of prolapsed and non- prolapsed anterior vaginal wall tissue within the same patient. Biopsies were collected from 12 premenopausal women undergoing prolapse surgery (cystocele POP-Q stage â‰¥ 2). A full thickness anterior vaginal wall sample was taken from the POP site during anterior colporrhaphy. An additional sample was taken from the non-prolapsed apex of the anterior vaginal cuff. Micro-array analysis was performed using whole genome GE 4x44K microarrays. Beside a significance analysis of micro-array (SAM), also a visual cluster analysis was performed.

DESIGN
12 women with POP: 12 biopsies anterior vaginal wall (POP site) versus 12 biopies precervical anterior vaginal wall ( non POP site)

PLATFORM
GPL18142 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Gene symbol version)
