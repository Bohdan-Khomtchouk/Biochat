TITLE
AGAMOUS-GR time-course experiment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Inflorescences of ag-1;35S::AG-GR plants were treated for 0,4,8,10, or 16 hours with dexamethasone or were mock-treated. Two biologically independent sets of samples were generated and RNA probes derived from these samples were co-hybridized to a cDNA array enriched for flower-specific transcripts. Keywords: time-course
