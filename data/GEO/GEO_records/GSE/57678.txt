TITLE
The homeoprotein Six2 promotes breast cancer metastasis via transcriptional and epigenetic control of E-cadherin expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse mammary carcinoma cell line 4TO7 was used in this experiment. Six2 overepxression experiment.The mouse Six2 cDNA taken from CMV-sport6 (Open Biosystems) was cloned into a pcDNA3.1-hygromycin vector and transfected into 4TO7 cells, after which stably transfected cells were selected. Gene expression profiles were performed in triplicate for the control and over-expressed lines.

DESIGN
six samples, three controls and three replicates with Six2 overexpression.
