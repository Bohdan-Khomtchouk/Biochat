TITLE
Ingestion of Cryptococcus neoformans by macrophages damages multiple host cellular processes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Human infection with Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), a prevalent fungal pathogen, occurs by inhalation and deposition in the lung alveoli of infectious particles. The subsequent host pathogen interaction is multifactorial and can result either in eradication, latency or extra-pulmonary dissemination. Successful control of Cn infection is dependent on host macrophages as shown by numerous studies. However in vitro macrophages display little ability to kill Cn. Recently, we reported that ingestion of Cn by macrophages induces early cell cycle progression that is subsequently followed by mitotic arrest, an event that almost certainly reflects damage to the host cell. The goal of the present work was to understand macrophage pathways affected by Cn toxicity. Infection of J774.16 macrophage-like cell line macrophages by Cn in vitro was associated with changes in gene pattern expression.  Concomitantly we observed depolarization of macrophage mitochondria and alterations in protein translation rate. Our results indicate that Cn infection impairs multiple host cellular functions. Therefore we conclude Cn intracellular residence in macrophages undermines the health of these critical phagocytic cells interfering with their ability to clear the fungal pathogen.
