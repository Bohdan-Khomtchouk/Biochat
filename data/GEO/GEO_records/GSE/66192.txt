TITLE
A study of the effect of OxLDL on C/EBP beta binding in human macrophages using chromatin immunoprecipitation for C/EBP beta with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the C/EBP beta transcription factor binding landscape in human macrophages and oxLDL-induced foam cells

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for C/EBP beta binding was performed in human macrophages and oxLDL induced-foam cells with quadruple biological replicates
