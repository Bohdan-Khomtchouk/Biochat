TITLE
Transcriptional Profiles Induced by the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Agonists 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzofuran and 2,3,4,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran in Primary Rat Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of primary rat hepatocytes exposed to high and low doses of three compounds, as well as untreated cells.  All samples were co-hybridized with DMSO controls.

DESIGN
A direct two-color experiment design, with each treated sample co-hybridized with a DMSO control. Hepatocytes derived from two animals were used as biological replicates. Four microarrays were completed for each chemical/dose combination. The four replicate arrays represent two dye-swapped microarrays for each of the two animals.
