SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of mononuclear side population (SP) and main population (MP) cells of human fetal skeletal muscle from 12 human subjects of gestational age 14-18 weeks.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted and profiled from 12 human fetal skeletal muscle side population (SP) cells and 10 corresponding human skeletal muscle main population (MP) cells.
