TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed in lung cancer cells after the transfection of miR-221 or miR-222.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate involvement of miR-221 and miR-222 in lung cancer, we investigated the effects of miR-221 and miR-222 overexpression on six lung cancer cell lines as well as one immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cell line.

DESIGN
Two cell lines, H3255 and H1299 with no replicates were studied.  Cells were transfected with miR-221, miR-222, or miR control.  Microarray analysis was done to identify genes differentially expressed in lung cancer cells after the transfection of miR-221 or miR-222.
