TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with CNTs, ginsenosides (Rb1 and Rg1) and  conjugates (Rb-CNTs and Rg-CNTs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of ginsenosides-CNTs conjugtaes on total expression profile of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we conjugated ginsenoides Rb1 and Rg1 with multi-walled carbon nanotubes in a 5:1 ratio. Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in MCF-7 cells treated with ginsenoside-CNTs conjugates and compare it to the ginsenosides alone (Rb1 and Rg1)

DESIGN
MCF-7 breast cancer cells were incubated with CNTs (8 ug/ml), Rb1 (2 ug/ml), Rg1 (2 ug/ml), Rb-CNTs (10 ug/ml) and Rg-CNTs (10 ug/ml) for 24 hours  and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. type: cell death responses

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
