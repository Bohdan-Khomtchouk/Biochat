TITLE
Expression data from colorectal cancer cell lines transfected with CDKL1-shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CDKL1 protein was overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissue. Knockdown of CDKL1 in HCT116 and Caco2 significantly inhibited cell growth, colony formation ability, tumor invasion, and G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of colorectal cells after CDKL1 knockdown by shRNA.

DESIGN
CDKL1-shRNA-expressing and control-shRNA-expressing lentivirus were constructed and infected into colorectal cancer cells DLD1. Then total RNA was prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three independent samples were collected for each group.
