TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 6 MCL and 18 CLL patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in 6 MCL and 18 CLL patient samples compared in independent analyses to CD19 selected healthy donor B-cell samples.

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 18 CLL patient samples and 6 MCL patient samples was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 16 441 transcripts, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes compared to healthy CD19 positive sorted B-cells by Significance Analysis of Microarray data.
