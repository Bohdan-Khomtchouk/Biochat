TITLE
Influence of G0s2 gene knockdown on primary hepatocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis. Circadian clock systems have been related in cell cycle and carcinogenesis. In this study, hepatocarcinogenesis induced by DEN administration in mice was inhibited by knockdown of G0s2 at early stage in carcinogenesis. In addition, the circadian expression of G0s2 in mouse liver was regulated by RARÎ± controlled by clock genes and ATRA. Moreover, mice administered both ATRA and DEN were not induced hepatocellular carcinoma, and decreased the expression of G0s2 at second day after the initiation of administration. These findings suggest that the control of G0s2 expression is important in carcinogenesis and G0s2 might be the novel target for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression between G0s2 siRNA or  Control siRNA transfected primary hepatocyte was measured after 24 hr of transfection.
