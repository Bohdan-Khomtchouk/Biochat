TITLE
Genes regulated by AML1/ETO in U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in U937 cells expressing AML1/ETO compared to vector transfected U937 cells. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation

DESIGN
A U937 cell line that conditionally expresses HA-tagged AML1/ETO under the control of the mouse metallothionine promoter (U937-A1E) (Alcalay et al., J.Clin.Invest, 2003,112, 1751-1761) was used. A cell line caryying the empty vector was used as control Cells were treated for 8h with 100uM ZnSO4 to induce transgene expression. For each of the U937 cell lines (AML1/ETO and Mt), three independent RNA extractions were performed, and an equal quantity of each of the three RNA preparations was then mixed to generate an RNA pool for each sample.
