TITLE
Genes regulated by AML1/ETO in U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in U937 cells expressing AML1/ETO compared to vector transfected U937 cells. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation
