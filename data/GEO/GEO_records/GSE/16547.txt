TITLE
KSHV Manipulates Notch Signaling by Upregulating Dll4 and JAG1 to Alter Cell Cycle Gene Expression in LECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognizable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. Here we examine KSHVs modulation of Notch signaling using wild-type LEC cells co-cultured with DLL4 and JAG1 expressing LEC cells.

DESIGN
There are  1) n=2 of LEC control cells co-cultured with pSIN expressing LEC, 2) n=3 of LEC co-cultured with pSIN-Dll4 expressing LEC, and 3) n=3 of LEC co-cultured with pSIN-JAG1 expressing LEC.
