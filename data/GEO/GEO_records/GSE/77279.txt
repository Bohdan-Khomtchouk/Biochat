TITLE
The long non-coding RNA(lncRNA)  expression profiles in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, we conducted lncRNA profiling in three pairs of proliferative HAVSMCs and quiescent HAVSMCs by microarray. Our results showed that lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in proliferative HAVSMCs compared with quiescent HAVSMCs, and provided potential targets for novel insights into VSMC proliferation or vascular remodeling diseases.

DESIGN
The lncRNA expression profiles of three paired proliferative HAVSMCs and quiescent HAVSMCs were analyzed using the microarry platform.
