TITLE
The contribution of RNA decay quantitative trait loci to inter-individual variation in steady-state gene expression levels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the extent to which inter-individual variation in mRNA decay contributes to inter-individual variation in gene expression levels in humans. The study examines properties of genome-wide decay rates and the relationship between mRNA decay and gene expression across genes, across individuals, and finally across genotype classes.

DESIGN
70 human lymphoblastoid cell lines were treated with Actinomycin D to arrest transcription. Transcript abundance was measured at 5 timepoints: before transcription (0 hours) and after  transcription (0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours). Data was then used to estimate gene-specific decay rates genome-wide.
