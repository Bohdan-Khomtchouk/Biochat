TITLE
High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals Differential Expression of miRNAs in respiratory tree from the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus Under Hypoxia Stress

ORGANISM
Apostichopus japonicus

SUMMARY
The present study identified and characterized miRNAs, which may play a major role in stress resistance. we applied high-throughput sequencing to investigate the alterations of miRNAs expression of sea cucumber under hypoxia stress(DO2_1,DO2_2,DO2_3),slight hypoxia stress(DO4_1,DO4_2,DO4_3) and normal condition(DO8_1,DO8_2,DO8_3). These results will provide a basis for future studies of miRNA regulation in sea cucumbers under hypoxia stress.

DESIGN
9 individuals (3 biological replicates×3 sea cucumbers per biological replicate) under hypoxia stress (DO 2mg/L) last for three days were used for our experiments (3 biological replicates: DO2_1,DO2_2,DO2_3). 9 individuals (3 biological replicates×3 sea cucumbers per biological replicate) under slight hypoxia stress (DO 4mg/L) last for three days were used for our experiments (3 biological replicates: DO4_1,DO4_2,DO4_3).9 sea cucumbers  under normal condition (DO 8mg/L) (3 biological replicates×3 sea cucumbers per biological replicate) served as the control (3 biological replicates:DO8_1,DO8_2,DO8_3).
