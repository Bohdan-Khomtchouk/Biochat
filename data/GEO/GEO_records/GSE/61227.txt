TITLE
Characteristics of microRNA expression in mammary tissue of dairy and beef breed heifers

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that participate in regulation of gene expression. Their role during mammary gland development is still largely unknown. In the present study, we performed a microarray analysis to identify miRNAs associated with high mammogenic potential of bovine mammary gland. We identified 54 miRNAs differing significantly between mammary tissue of dairy (Holstein-Friesian, HF) and beef (Limousine, LM) post-pubertal heifers. Fifty two miRNAs had higher expression in the mammary tissue of LM heifers. Enrichment analyses for targeted genes revealed that the major differences between miRNA expression in the mammary gland of HF vs. LM were associated with regulation of signalling pathways crucial for mammary gland development, such as: TGF-beta, insulin, WNT and inflammatory pathways. Moreover, a number of genes potentially targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs was associated with mammary stem cellsâ€™ activity. These data indicate that in dairy cattle high developmental potential of the mammary gland, leading to high milk productivity, not only depends on central neuro-endocrine regulation but also on specific miRNA expression pattern.

DESIGN
miRNA  profiling of Holstein Freisian (dairy breed) and Limousne heifers (beef breed) mammay glands. Two-condition experiment, LM (test) vs. HF (reference). Total RNA was isolated from quarters of 4 LM and 4 HFmammary glands.
