TITLE
Human melanocytes: Control vs. RAS or BRAF Infected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human melanocytes comparing control untreated cells with cells infected with different oncogenic mutations. Goal was to determine the effects of melanoma-associated mutation overexpression on global melanocyte gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, non infected vs. infected cells. Two time points. Biological replicates: 2

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
