TITLE
Gene expression in mitotic tissues of Drosophila larvae without centrosomes or too many centrosomes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Centrosome defects are a common feature of many cancers. Surprisingly, flies can proceed through the majority of development without centrosomes or with amplified centrosomes in most of their cells. It is unclear whether this is because centrosome defects do not cause many problems in Drosophila cells, or because they can adapt to cope with any problems that arise. Indeed, centrosome loss and centrosome amplification predispose fly brain cells to form tumours. Here we assess how centrosome loss or centrosome amplification perturbs cell physiology by profiling the global transcriptome of Drosophila larval brains and imaginal discs that either lack centrosomes or have too many centrosomes.

DESIGN
Mitotic tissues (brains and imaginal discs) were dissected from 3rd instar Drosophila larvae of mutants lacking centrosomes (DSas-4 and DSas-6), a strain with too many centrosomes (SakOE) and two different wild type strains (w67 and OregonR). We extracted RNA from three biological replicates per strain and used it for hybridisation to Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays. Per biological sample, material dissected from ten larvae was pooled. Gene expression of the mutant strains was compared to both wild type controls.
