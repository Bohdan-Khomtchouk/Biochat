TITLE
IM006A - Mouse infection with PB1-F2del: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) at 10^3 PFU

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the host response (C57BL/6 mouse model) to the PB1-F2del: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^3 PFU.

DESIGN
Groups of 20-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with the PB1-F2del: A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) virus at 10^3 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 5 mice/time point for infections and 3 mice/time point for time-matched mocks. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional analysis and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
