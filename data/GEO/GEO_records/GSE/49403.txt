TITLE
RMST associates with SOX2 to regulate neurogenesis [Illumina expression data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that knockdown of the lncRNA RMST changes the gene expression profile of neural stem cells. RMST and SOX2 regulates a common subset of downstream targets.

DESIGN
Examination of genome wide transcriptomic changes upon knockdown of the lncRNA RMST.
