TITLE
miR-146a-5p circuitry uncouples cell proliferation and migration, but not differentiation, in human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has the potential to ameliorate degenerative disorders and to repair damaged tissues. The homing of transplanted MSCs to injured sites is a critical property of engraftment. Our aim was to identify microRNAs involved in controlling MSC proliferation and migration. MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (BM-MSCs and WJ-MSCs, respectively), and WJ-MSCs show poorer motility yet have a better amplification rate compared to BM-MSCs.

DESIGN
One human BM-MSC (pooled sample of 4 independent donors), one human WJ-MSC (pooled sample of 3 independent donors), and differentiated osteocytes and adipocytes derived from BM-MSCs after 2 weeks induction.
