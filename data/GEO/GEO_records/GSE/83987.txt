TITLE
Gene expression profiles of endothelial cells from mutants and siblings of tsu3994

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Through RNA-seq, we report endothelial cells from mutants had 1063 up-regulated and 132 down-regulated genes ( > 2.0 fold with false discovery rate < 0.001)  when compared to siblings.

DESIGN
Examination of gene exprssion profiles of endothelial cells from siblings and mutants of tsu3994
