TITLE
Gene expression profile of SYT-SSX2-expressing C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignancy characterized by the presence of a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18) that results in the formation of a fusion protein SYT-SSX.  Because it is believed that synovial sarcoma arises from mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells, we wanted to determine the changes in gene expression caused by SYT-SSX2 in untransformed mesenchymal progenitor cells - murine C2C12 myoblasts in this experiment.

DESIGN
In 2 independent experiments, C2C12 myoblasts were infected with retrovirus carrying either control vector (pOZ) or SYT-SSX2 expression vector.  Total cellular RNA was extracted 48 hours post-infection and utilized for microarray analysis on Affymetrix arrays.
