TITLE
Expression data for MCF-7 treated with PolII inhibitors, Triptolide or alpha-amanitin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of mRNA in mammalian is mainly performed by RNA polymerase II (PolII). POLRMT is responsible for the production of cytoplasmic and nuclear form of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The former (mtRNAP) participates in transcription of RNA in the mitochondria while the latter (spRNAP-IV) is responsible for some mRNA transcription in the nucleus. The nature and amount of genes transcribed by spRNAP-IV still remains unclear. Thus, we scanned for possible candidate genes by using Affymetrix.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To determine the inhibition of PolII transcription, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml of alpha-amanitin or 0.3μM of triptolide (Sigma) for 48 or 24 h, respectively.
