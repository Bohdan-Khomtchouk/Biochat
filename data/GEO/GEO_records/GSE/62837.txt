TITLE
Expression profile of primary and wound metastatic lesions of melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The phenomenon that metastatic lesion developed on injured sites has long been recognized in a number of cancers, such as melanoma. The factors associated with wound healing that attract circulating tumor cells have remained unknown, however. A patient with acral lentiginous melanoma presented with a metastatic lesion that appeared 1 month after trauma. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the promotion of wound metastasis in melanoma, we performed microarray analysis of the metastatic lesions (n = 2) and the primary lesions (n = 3) of the patient.

DESIGN
Using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array, we compared global gene expression profiles of tissues derived from the patientâ€™s primary (n = 3) and wound metastatic (n = 2) lesions to search for particular biological functions in genes of which expression intensities were increased in the wound metastasic lesions of melanoma.
