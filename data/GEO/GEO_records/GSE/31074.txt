TITLE
Essential role of gastric gland mucin in preventing gastric cancer in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which A4gnt-null mice develop gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric mucosa was isolated from the stomachs of wild-type and A4gnt-null mice, and microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the gastric mucosa stripped from the muscular layer of the glandular stomach of A4gnt-null and wild-type mice at 5, 10, and 50 weeks of age (one mouse per each group was analyzed).
