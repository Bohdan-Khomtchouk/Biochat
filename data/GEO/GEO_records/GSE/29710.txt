TITLE
Comparison of Ets2-null and control ES cell derived lineages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets2-null ES cells are defective in differentiating into cardiac myocytes, evidenced by the lack of spontaneous beating, cardiac transcription factors and structural proteins. With the Phalanx mouse Onearray v2, we compared the gene expression profiles of cells derived from Ets2-null and wildtype ES cells.

DESIGN
Standard embryoid body culture protocol was used to induce differentiation of murine ES cells. On the 10th day, replicates of either Ets2-null or control wildtype EB culture were collected in Trizol for total RNA extraction. Microarray was preformed by Phalanx.
