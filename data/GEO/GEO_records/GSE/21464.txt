TITLE
Expression profile of TTHA1939-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the TTHA1939-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70Â°C for 800 min.

DESIGN
Wild-type and the mutant strains were precultured in rich medium (TR medium) for two times at 70 oC and then subcultured to minimum essential medium (CS medium). These cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth phase (800 minutes from the start of culture). Total RNA were extracted from each strain and used for the cDNA synthesis. For the biological replication, above experiments were performed four times independently.
