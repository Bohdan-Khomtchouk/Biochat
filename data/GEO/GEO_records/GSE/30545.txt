TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling reveals transcriptional reprogramming in Fusarium graminearum by FgV1-DK21 virus infection

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Using a 3â€²-tiling microarray covering the whole F. graminearum genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of F. graminearum infected with FgV-DK21 (Mycovirus) at two different time stages (36 h and 120 h). Our study is the first report which elucidated the global alternation of the prominent cellular pathways in fungal host by FgV1-DK21 virus infection.

DESIGN
A total of 12 chips were used for microarray. At 36 h and 120 h, total RNAs were extracted from virus free Fusarium and virus infected Fusarium with three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13843 Roche Nimblegen G.zeae 135K microarray
