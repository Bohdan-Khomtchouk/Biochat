TITLE
Deletion of Pten leads to liver steatosis and tumor formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that deleting Pten in Albumin expressing cells results in liver steatosis as early as 1 month of age.  The mice develop hyperplasia and tumor phenotypes starting at 7-8 months of age.  At 12 months and beyond, all mice develope spontanous liver tumors of mixed lineage phenotypes  dihydrocollidine (DDC) shows that the primary effect of AKT2 loss is attenuation of hepatic injury and not inhibition of progenitor cell proliferation in response to injury.

DESIGN
Pten is deleted specifically in the liver (Pten loxP/loxP; Alb-Cre+).  Liver tissues were analyzed at 3 months (steatosis stage) and 15 months (tumor stage)
