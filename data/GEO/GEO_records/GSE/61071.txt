TITLE
Transcriptome wide identification of retained introns upon depletion of the splicing factors SNW1 or PRPF8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified which mRNAs are dependent on the splicing factors SNW1 or PRPF8. These factors were depleted in HeLa cells by RNAi, and the levels of intronic reads in mRNAs was compared to control RNAi.

DESIGN
Intronic reads from polyA containing RNAs from HeLa cells and mSnw1-LAP 'rescued' cells, both depleted for endogenous SNW1, were compared. Furthermore, intronic reads from polyA containing RNAs from HeLa cells depleted for SNW1 or PRPF8 were compared to control depleted HeLa cells.
