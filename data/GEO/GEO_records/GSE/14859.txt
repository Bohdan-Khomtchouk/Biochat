TITLE
ArrayCGH mapping of chromosome 3 aberrations in lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To prospectively identify new oncogenes implicated in lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma pathogenesis, we investigated chromosome 3 aberrations in advanced tumours using arrayCGH. These aberrations are indeed among the most frequent aberrations in lung SCC and correlate with SCC patient's poor prognosis. We precisely map regions of recurrent losses at 3p and gains at 3q25-qter in a series of lung SCC. We moreover uncover 3q26.3-q27 high level amplifications in 20% of tumours. Keywords: ArrayCGH, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, 3q26.3, SOX2

DESIGN
Profiling of 26 advanced (stage III) lung SCC. Replicates : each tumor sample is hybridized together with a normal dna sample to one microarray. Each microarray contain 3 replicates per BAC clone.
