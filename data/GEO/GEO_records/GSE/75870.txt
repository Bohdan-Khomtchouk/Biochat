TITLE
Gene expression in the mouse adult small intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared between adult wildtype (WT)  CD1 jejunual epithelium (J) and ileal epithleium (I). Gene expression was compared between adult control ileal epithleium and Gata4 conditional knockin (cKI) ileal epithelium. Gene expression was compared between adult wildtype CD1 jejunum and Gata4 conditional knockout (cKO) jejunal epithelium.

DESIGN
Adult jejunal and/or ileal tissue was collected from wildtype CD1 mice, Gata4 conditional knockin mice, and Gata4 conditional knockout mice. Epithelial cells were isolated, and RNA was prepared.  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 gene arrays were used to interrogate gene expression.  Data was analyzed using Partek Genomic Suite.
