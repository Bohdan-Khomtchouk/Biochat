TITLE
fireman vs wt erwinia infection-Impact of the fireman mutation in the Erwinia amylovora response of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt09-02_fireman - fireman vs wt erwinia infection - A meta-analysis ot the CATMA transcriptomic data has shown that an orphan gene of Arabidopsis: AT5E39460, recently remaned AT5G 44585, is highly responsive to biotic stresses. An homozygous mutant of this gene, named fireman has been produced and displays less cell death symptoms in comparison to the wild type in response to Erwinia amylovora infection. The purpose of this transcriptomic analysis is to understand which pathways are altered in this mutant versus the wild-type in response to this phytopathogenic bacteria. - 3 inoculated leaves of 5 weeks old plants, per plant, have been harvested 24h after inoculation with H20 or E. amylovora, strain 1430. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison, normal vs transgenic comparaison

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
