TITLE
microRNA  expression profile of activated versus non activated primary B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA  expression profile in 5 indepent sets of paired samples of LPS+IL-4 activated versus non activated primary mouse spleen B cells Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Activated B cells for miRNA array analysis were obtained after CFSE labelling (Molecular Probes), LPS+IL4 stimulation for 3 days and sorting of cells that had undergone at least 1 cell division. Sortings were performed with a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
