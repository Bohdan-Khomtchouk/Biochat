TITLE
DLX3 alters transcriptomic profile of adhesion, cell cycle, and cell death in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reinstatement of DLX3 into SCC13 cells upregulates genes involved with cell cycle exit, signaling, and adhesion whiles downregulates genes involved with cell death, proliferation, and movement.

DESIGN
We used RNA-sequencing data analysis to assess gene expression in SCC13 cells infected with Adeno-GFP or Adeno-DLX3 in order to understand the effects of DLX3 in a Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Line.  We identified a specific subset of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle arrest and inhibition of apoptosis.
