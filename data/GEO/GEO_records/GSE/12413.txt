TITLE
Prediction of left ventricle systolic dysfunction in mice using gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis that a set of differentially expressed genes could be used to predict cardiovascular phenotype in mice after prolonged catecholamine stress. Keywords: Treatment

DESIGN
We observed that WT FVB and B2KO mice developed systolic dysfunction in response to continuous catecholamine infusion while WT C57 mice developed diastolic dysfunction.  Using these mice as the derivation cohort, we identified a set of 83 genes whose differential expression correlated with left ventricle systolic dysfunction.  The gene set was then used to accurately predict development of left ventricle systolic dysfunction in a separate group of mice (WT B6129SF2/J) after catecholamine stress.
