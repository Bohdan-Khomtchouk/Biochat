TITLE
Development of coregulator-dependent androgen receptor target gene signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To decipher the contribution of coregulators to androgen receptor target gene expression, effect of siRNA-mediated silencing of 18 clinically relevant coregulators on bona fide androgen receptor target gene expression was studied.

DESIGN
Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells were transfected with individual siRNA SmartPools targeting 18 clinically relevant coregulators or a non-targeting siRNA SmartPool. Forty-two hours after transfection, cells were treated with synthetic androgen R1881 (5nM) or vehicle. Three biological replicates were generated per treatment group. Forty-eight hours later, total RNA was isolated and processed for Agilent microarray analysis. The two normalizer are aliquots from same RNA sample that serves as internal control.
