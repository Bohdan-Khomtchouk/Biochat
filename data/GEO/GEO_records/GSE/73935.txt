SUMMARY
The development of cytostatic-drug resistance renders chemotherapy ineffective in treating ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynaecological malignancy. In many cases, it is difficult to explain the development of drug resistance based on the expression patterns of genes known to be involved in this process. Microarray-based assays can provide information about new genes that are involved in the resistance to cytostatic drugs. This report describes alterations in the level of expression of genes in cisplatin- (CisPt), doxorubicin- (Dox), topotecan- (Top), and paclitaxel- (Pac) resistant variants of W1 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines. These drug-resistant variants of the W1 and A2780 cell lines were generated through the stepwise selection of cells tolerant of exposure to the indicated drugs at incrementally increased concentrations. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome Array Strips were used for hybridization assays. The genes with significantly altered expression levels (upregulated by more than fivefold or downregulated by less than fivefold relative to the level in the parental line) in the drug-resistant sublines were selected and were filtered using volcano plotting. We observed alterations in the expression of 22 genes that were common to all three cell lines that were resistant to the same cytostatic drug. The level of expression of 13 genes was upregulated and that of nine genes was downregulated. In the CisPt-resistant cell line, we observed downregulated expression of ABCC6, BST2, ERAP2 and MCTP1; in the Pac-resistant cell line, we observe upregulated expression of ABCB1, EPHA7 and RUNDC3B and downregulated expression of LIPG, MCTP1, NSBP1, PCDH9, PTPRK and SEMA3A. The expression levels of three genes, ABCB1, ABCB4 and IFI16, were upregulated in the Dox-resistant cell lines. In the Top-resistant cell lines, we observed increased expression levels of ABCG2, HERC5, IFIH1, MYOT, S100A3, SAMD4A, SPP1 and TGFBI and decreased expression levels of MCTP1 and PTPRK

DESIGN
In this study, we used two ovarian cancer cell lines, the established ovarian cancer A2780 cell line and the primary ovarian cancer W1 cell line. The human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell line was purchased from ATCC. A2780 sublines that were resistant to CisPt [A2780CR1 and A2780CR2 (A2780 cisplatin resistant)], Pac [A2780PR1 and A2780PR2 (A2780 paclitaxel resistant)], Dox [A2780DR1 and A2780DR2 (A2780 doxorubicin resistant)] and Top [A2780TR1 and A2780TR2 (A2780 topotecan resistant)] were generated by exposing A2780 cells to the relevant drugs at incrementally increased concentrations. The human ovarian cancer W1 cell line was established using ovarian cancer tissue obtained from an untreated patient. W1 sublines resistant to CisPt  [W1CR (W1 cisplatin resistant)], Dox [W1DR (W1 doxorubicin resistant)], Top  [W1TR (W1 topotecan resistant)], Met [W1MR (W1 methotrexate resisntant)], Vin [W1VR (W1 vincristine resistant)] and Pac [W1PR (W1 paclitaxel resistant)] were obtained by exposing W1 cells to the drugs at incrementally increased concentrations.
