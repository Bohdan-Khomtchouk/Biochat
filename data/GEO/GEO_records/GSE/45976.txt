miR-182 and miR-10a are Key Regulators of Treg specialisation and stability during Th2 and Th1-associated Inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A variety of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cell types have been described previously, indicating molecular heterogeneity within the Foxp3+ pool of CD4+ T cells. However, the factors that shape the transcriptomic identities of different Foxp3+ Treg cells are poorly understood. To identify the molecular pathways involved, we isolated CD4+Foxp3gfp+ cells from Th1-rich or Th2-rich environments following chronic Leishmania major or Schistosoma mansoni infection, respectively. Whole genome expression profiling and next generation small RNA sequencing revealed significantly different mRNA and miRNA profiles. In-silico analyses identified miR-10a and miR-182 as ‘regulatory miRNA hubs’ in CD4+Foxp3+ cells in Th1 and Th2-environments, respectively. Using in vitro and in vivo systems we identified that IL-12/IFNg down-regulated miR-10a and its putative transcription factor, Creb. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-10a controls a suite of genes that regulate IFNg production in Th1-Treg cells. Also, Treg cells treated with IL-4 increased miR-182 and its putative transcription factor, cMaf. Up-regulation of miR-182 mitigated IL-2 secretion, in part through repression of IL2-promoting genes, including Bach2 and Cd2ap. This study indicates that CD4+Foxp3+ cells are influenced by their environment, and that Th1 or Th2 environments promote distinct miRNA pathways, preserving Treg stability and suppressor function.
