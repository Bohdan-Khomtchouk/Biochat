TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human heart valves

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Semilunar valve leaflets have a well-described trilaminar histoarchitecture with a sophisticated elastic fiber network. It was previously proposed that elastin-containing fibers play a subordinate role in early human cardiac valve development; however, this assumption was based on data obtained from mouse models and human second and third trimester tissues. Here, we systematically analyzed tissues from human fetal first (4-12 weeks) and second (13-18 weeks) trimester, adolescent (14-19 years) and adult (50-55 years) hearts to monitor the temporal and spatial distribution of elastic fibers, focusing on semilunar valves. Global gene expression analyses revealed that the transcription of genes essential for elastic fiber formation starts early within the first trimester. These data were confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry employing antibodies that recognize fibronectin, fibrilin-1, -2 and -3, EMILIN-1, fibulin-4 and fibulin-5, which were all expressed at the onset of cardiac cushion formation (~week 4 of development). Tropoelastin/ elastin protein expression was first detectable in leaflets of 7-week hearts.   We revealed that immature elastic fibers are organized in early human cardiovascular development, and mature elastin-containing fibers first evolve in semilunar valves when blood pressure and heartbeat accelerate. Our findings provide a conceptual framework with the potential to lead to novel hypotheses in human cardiac valve development and disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from fetal cardiac valve cushions, developed fetal heart valves, adolescent heart valves, and adult heart valves.
