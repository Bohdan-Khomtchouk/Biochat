TITLE
Expression data from A549 cells infected by adenovirus not carrying virus associated sequences in the genome.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-coding small RNAs are involved in viral life cycles. Adenovirus-encoding small RNAs, virus-associated RNAs (VA RNAs), are transcribed throughout the replication process, and the transcript levels depend on the copy numbers of the viral genome. Although the VA RNA transcription starts immediate early phase, little is known about the function in the early phase. Here we applied replication-deficient adenovirus vectors (AdVs) and novel VA-RNA deleted AdVs to analyze expression change of cellular gene mediated by VA RNAs.

DESIGN
Human lung cell, A549, were infected by VA(+) or VA(-) adenoviral vectors. After the designed preiod of infection, cells were harvested and RNA was extacted, followed by DNA microarray analysis.
