TITLE
genes regulated by mitoflash

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found mitoflash has function in reprogramming. So we examined the genes expression after activation of mitoflash during somatic cell reprogramming. There are two ways to improve the mitoflash. First we overexpressed CypD, a mPTP component, to improve the mitoflash. Second we used the durgs, mastoparan and paraquat to increase the mitoflash. The MEF cells were reprogrammed, and treatment with mastoparan, paraquat or overexpressed with CypD. After activation of mitoflash at different times, the cells were collected for RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
MEF cells were reprogrammed and expressed with CypD and Flag (as control) for 4 days. The cells were collected for RNA-Seq (Samples: Falg-D4, CypD-D4). MEF cells were reprogrammed and treated with mastoparan and paraquat for 8 days. The cells were collected for RNA-Seq (Samples: control-D8, mastoparan-D8 and paraquat-D8).
