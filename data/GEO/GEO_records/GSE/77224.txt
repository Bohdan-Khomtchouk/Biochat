TITLE
DNA copy number variation analysis in hepatoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed specific genes for DNA copy number variation in hepatoma cells and investigated whether these factors are related to liver cancer phenotype. Chromosome 20p, which includes the ligand for Notch pathways, Jagged1, was found to be amplified in several types of hepatoma cells. In conclusion, amplification of Jagged1 contributed to mRNA expression that activates the Jagged1-Notch signaling pathway in liver cancer and led to poor outcome.

DESIGN
Comparative genomic hybridization arrays spotted with 1,440 bacterial artificial chromosome clones were used to assess copy number changes in 7 hepatoma cell lines and 2 non-hepatoma cell lines to identify chromosomal regions associated with the pathogenesis of liver cancer.
