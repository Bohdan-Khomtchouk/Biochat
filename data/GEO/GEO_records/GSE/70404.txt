TITLE
Investigation about Monocytes in metastatic breast cancer patients under chemotherapy +/- Avastin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine if blood circulating monocytes of metastatic breast cancer patient would express a different activation profile compared to healthy donors, in order to use this specific changesas biomarkers to monitor then response to therapy

DESIGN
CD11b+ cells were extracted from all blood of 4 healthy donors and 4 metastatic breast cancer patients using magnetic beads separation (Miltenyi). CD11b+ cells were then lysed and mRNA was extracted to perform RNASeq.
