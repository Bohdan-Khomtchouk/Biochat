TITLE
Expression profiling of WM9 and 1205Lu with shILEI.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used lentiviral shRNA vectors to generate pools of melanoma cells (1205Lu and WM9) stably knocked down for ILEI (FAM3C).

DESIGN
Melanoma cell lines characterized by a low-MITF invasive state express high levels of ILEI. We have used lentiviral shRNA vectors to generate pools of melanoma cells (1205Lu and WM9) stably knocked down for ILEI (FAM3C). In vitro measures of invasion show that ILEI knockdown attenuate invasive potential.
