TITLE
Nucleosome free chromatin measured by ATAC-seq in Rice leaves (Oryza sativa)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Nucleosome free measurement of 14 day old rice leaves (2nd leaf) in heat stress and recovery and dehydration stress and recovery

DESIGN
5 conditions: control (30C, liquid media; at 0.5h, 2h, 4h); Heat (transferred from 30C to 40C; at 0.5h, 2h, 4h); Heat recovery (transferred back to 30C after 2h at 40C; after 2h); Dehydration (roots exposed to air; at 2h); Dehydration recovery (roots returned to liquid media after 1.5h in air; after 2h) Samples: 2 biological replicates.
