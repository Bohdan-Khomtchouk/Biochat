TITLE
Evx1as does not have a function independent of Evx1 during gastrulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated loss of function mESC clones by CRISPR-Cas9 to test whether Evx1as has a function beyond that of Evx1. Evx1/Evx1asΔ2.6kb (Del#3) mESCs were differentiated to D4 in serum and compared directly to Evx1Δfs mESCs

DESIGN
Three side by side differentiations (replicates) were performed and sequenced for both the Del3 (Evx1/Evx1asΔ2.6kb) mESCs and the Evx1Δfs Clone 14 mESCs. Each side by side differentiation was set up on a different day.
