TITLE
Msn2 controls the yeast metabolic focus

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Msn2 is a transcription factor required for integration of environmental and metabolic signals. Msn2 is directly regulated by the carbon source sensing PKA and AMP pathways. Here we analyse the role of Msn2 for metabolic adjustment by using point mutants mimicking the dephosphorylated state.

DESIGN
Yeast cells were grown in exponential phase and treated with 6nM  17ÃŸ-Estradiol  for 90 minutes to induce the expression of the Msn2A6 gene. Experiments were performed with 2 biological replicates. 0min refers to the untreated culture

PLATFORM
