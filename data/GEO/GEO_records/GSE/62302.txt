TITLE
Expression data from loss-of-TET2 and/or JAK2V617F mutant Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that both TET2 mutation and JAK2V617F mutation are frequent in myeloproliferative neoplasms patients. The pathophysiological roles of each mutation have been elucidated in murine models, but the cooperative effect of the two mutations has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we examined the function of the cooperative effect of loss-of-TET2 function and JAK2V617F mutation in murine hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
In this study, we utilized wild type (WT) mice, TET2 knock down (TET2KD) mice, JAK2V617F transgenic mice, double mutant mice. We transplanted 4 types of E14.5 fetal liver cells (WT, TET2KD, JAK2V617F, double mutant) into lethally irradiated mice. At 10-16 weeks post-transplantation, LSK cells from the BM of the recipients were collected, and gene expression analysis was performed. (WT,5 mice at 16 weeks; TET2KD, 5 mice at 10 weeks; JAK2V617F, 5 mice at 16 weeks; double mutant, 5 mice at 13 weeks)
