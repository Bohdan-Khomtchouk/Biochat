TITLE
The in vivo responses elicited by Clostridium difficile in response to the gut commensal B. thetaiotaomicron and diet

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ; Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
Analysis of Clostridium difficile (Cd) from the cecal contents of germ-free mice or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt)-monocolonized mice on a standard, polysaccharide rich diet or polysaccharide deficient diet 5 days after infection. Results identify genes that are involved in the Cd response to diet, in vivo colonization and in interactions with Bt.

DESIGN
In vitro transcriptional profiles of Clostridium difficile obtained from cecal contents of germ-free or Bt-monocolonized mice on a standard, polysaccharide rich or polysaccharide deficient diet. 4 samples/group. 2 control genomic DNA samples for Clostridium difficile and 2 reference genomic DNA samples for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Please note that 4 control samples (genomic DNA) were used to determine whether the genomic DNA correctly bound to the probes and thus, were not included in data processing (i.e no processed/normalized data).
