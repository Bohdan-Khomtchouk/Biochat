TITLE
The effect of the magnesium and copper supplementation in the transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae JP1 under fermentation condition

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In our previous work, we showed the positive effect of the magnesium and the negative effect of the copper on yeast fermentation performance. The magnesium increases the ethanol yield and a faster glucose consumption by the yeast, on the other hand, the copper provides an opposite effect in yeast under fermentation condition. Therefore, from this contrasting effect we performed the gene-wide expression analysis in the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae JP1 under fermentation condition in order to reveal the gene expression profile upon magnesium and copper supplementation.

DESIGN
Fermentation assays was performed with the industrial yeast S. cerevisiae JP1 in reference medium (mineral concentration balanced), in the medium supplemented with 500 mg/L of magnesium (Mg2+ medium) and in the medium supplemented with 1 mg/L of copper (Cu2+ medium).
