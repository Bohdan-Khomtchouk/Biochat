TITLE
SNP genotyping data from human iPSCs and human fibroblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human induced pluripotent stem cells changed the face of stem cell biology as they represent a renewable source of stem cells with the potential to differentiated into multiple lineages in a manner akin to embryonic stem cells that can be collected without the need for the destruction of an embryo. The potential of these cells as research tools is vast as they can be pushed to generate different cell types depending on research interest. Many complex diseasese.g. late onset alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes have known genetic risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing a disease. We performed whole genome SNP analysis to examine risk loci for different complex diseases in our donor iPS cells toanalyse disease risk and also assess which donor represents the best healthy background.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was isolated from human induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 donors and fibroblasts from an additional donor for genome-wide SNP analysis. This study was completed using the Affymetrix human genome-wide array 6.0 and analysed using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console Birdseed V2 algorithm.
