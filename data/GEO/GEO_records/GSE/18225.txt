TITLE
Expression data from early anther

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed microarray experiments with RNAs from dissected immature anthers (stages 4-7) from wild-type, dyt1  and ams mutant plants, using the Affymetrix ATH1 chip.

DESIGN
Anthers from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected at 4-7 stages of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Samples from two mutants and wild-type anther.
