TITLE
Hes1 and Glucocorticoid Signaling in Bone Sarcoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of HES1 during glucocorticoid signaling in bone sarcoma cells (U2OS-GR cells) , we employed whole-genome microarray expressions in  mRNA extracted from control U2OS-GR and Hes1-overexpressed U2OS-GR cells.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from control U2OS-GR and Hes1-overexpressed U2OS-GR cells treated with VEH or Dexamethasone.
