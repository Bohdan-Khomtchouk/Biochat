TITLE
Expression data from glioma cells exposed to interferon (IFN)-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioma cells are sensitized to the alkylator temozolomide after exposure to IFN-beta. In glioma-initiating cells (GIC), IFN-beta alone reduces clonogenicity. We investigated differentially expressed genes with or without IFN exposure in either longterm glioma cells or GIC. We used microarrays to investigate differential gene regulation in glioma cells after exposure to either ddH20 or IFN-beta 300 IU/ml at 6 h or 24 h.

DESIGN
We used either the longterm cell line LNT-229 or the GIC cell lines GS-2 and GS-9 and exposed them to either IFN-beta 300 IU/ml or ddH20 for 6 h or 24 h.
