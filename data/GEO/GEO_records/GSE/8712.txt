TITLE
The effects of Yariv-reagent on barley aleurone GA signaling

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed to know how many gibberellin (GA)-responsive genes are inhibited by beta-Yariv reagent, a specific binder of plant arabinogalactan-proteins.  cRNAs were prepared from mRNAs isolated from aleurone protoplasts that were treated with GA, GA plus beta-Yariv reagent, or mock (DMSO)-treated for 24 hours, and were subjected to microarray analysis. The analysis was performed twice using target cRNAs prepared independently. Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
2 control (DMSO), 2 gibberellin and 2 gibberellin plus beta-Yariv reagent-treated biological replicates were analyzed at 24 h.
