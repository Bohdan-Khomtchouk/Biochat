TITLE
affy_sunflower_2010_13-ROS and hormones in sunflower seed dormancy.

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_sunflower_2010_13 - affy_sunflower_2010_13 - It concerns the interaction between ROS and hormones in dormancy release in sunflower seeds. ABA is responsible for dormancy maintenance, while GA and ethylene promote seed germination. Based on our results, ROS could represent good candidate to shift from a hormone signalling to another determining the dormancy state in sunflower seeds.-We aim to understand the mechanisms controlling sunflower seed dormancy at the transcriptomic level, by the application of treatments which maintain dormancy as ABA, or alleviate dormancy as ROS and ethylene. Transcripts comparison will be performed between dormant and non-dormant sunflower embryo imbibed 24h on water, on ABA, on methylviologen, a pro-oxidant compound or on ethylene.

DESIGN
12 arrays - SUNFLOWER; treated vs untreated comparison
