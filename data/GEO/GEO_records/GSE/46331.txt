TITLE
24-hour herbivory exposure of VHb-expressing Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

ORGANISM
Populus euphratica

SUMMARY
The expression of stress-related genes induced by feeding of chestnut moth larvae (Conistra vaccinii L.) was studied with Vitreoscilla hemoglobin-expressing (VHb) and non-transgenic hybrid aspen lines (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides). Besides the herbivore-injured leaves (L1), cDNA microarray analyses were conducted using uninjured leaves of hybrid aspen lines positioned above (A) and below (B) the herbivory exposed leaves.
