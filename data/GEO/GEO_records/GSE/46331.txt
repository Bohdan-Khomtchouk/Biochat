TITLE
24-hour herbivory exposure of VHb-expressing Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

SUMMARY
The expression of stress-related genes induced by feeding of chestnut moth larvae (Conistra vaccinii L.) was studied with Vitreoscilla hemoglobin-expressing (VHb) and non-transgenic hybrid aspen lines (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides). Besides the herbivore-injured leaves (L1), cDNA microarray analyses were conducted using uninjured leaves of hybrid aspen lines positioned above (A) and below (B) the herbivory exposed leaves.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. herbivory exposure. Two hybrid aspen lines: non-transgenic V617 and VHb expressing V617 /45. Of each plant, three leaf types were analysed: the injured/uninjured leaf (L1) and nonorthostichous leaf positioned above (A) and below (B). Biological replicates: 3. On each array, two samples representing L1, A or B leaf type of control and herbivory treatment of either V617 or V617/45 line. line V617: wt_A_rep1-3, wt_B_rep1-3, wt_L1_rep1-3 line V617/45: VHb_A_rep1-3, VHb_B_rep1-3, VHb_L1_rep1-3 leaf type A: wt_A_rep1-3, VHb_A_rep1-3 leaf type B: wt_B_rep1-3, VHb_B_rep1-4 leaf type L1: wt_L1_rep1-3, VHb_L1_rep1-5
