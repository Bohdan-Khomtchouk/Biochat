TITLE
KSHV microRNA transfection and human mRNA expression changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HUVECs transfected with KSHV miRNA mimics (vMix) or a negative control mimic (neg). To identify host RNA targets of KSHV miRNAs, we took advantage of the observation that RNAs targeted by miRNAs can display small reductions in their steady-state levels.

DESIGN
Cells transfected with negative control miRNA compared to cells transfected with KSHV miRNAs. Experimental treatment versus control treatment

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
