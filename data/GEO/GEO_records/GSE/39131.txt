TITLE
Stump project -- methylation whole tissue; volar versus non-volar acral skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To broaden our understanding of the gene expression common to volar skin, we biopsied the dorsum of the hand, palm, dorsum of the foot and sole and collected DNA for methylation chip anlayses

DESIGN
Total of 12 skin biopsy samples with 3 repeats from distinct individuals of each site: dorsum of hand, palm, dorstum of foot and sole. The samples below represent methylation data only.
