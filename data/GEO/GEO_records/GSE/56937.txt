TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling after acute radiation doses in recurrent U87-MG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine short- and long-term gene expression responses following high dose radiation exposure in vitro with the U87-MG cell line.  Samples were examined at 1, 4, 6 or 35 days after irradiation with 8 or 16Gy.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at 1, 4, 6 or 35+/-1 days after acute exposure to 8 or 16Gy (48cGy per minute).  Control non-irradiated 0Gy samples were also collected at each time point. Non-normalized data has a total of 48 microarray samples.  The normalized data has a total of 39 samples.  Short-term samples on days 1, 4, and 6 used 3 independent experimental replicates resulting in 27 microarrays (3 experimental conditions × 3 independent replicates × 3 time points).   RNA from replicate1 for days 1, 4 and 6 was run in techincal duplicate (rep1a & rep1b) and the average signal was used for analysis.  Long-term samples on day 35 used four replicates representing 3 independent experimental replicates resulting 12 microarrays.
