TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for hepatocellular carcinoma tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic variations play an important role in tumor development and metastasis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite improvements in surveillance and clinical treatment strategies, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array were used to evaluate the genetic characteristics of tumor DNA in 30 HBV-related HCC patients who were underwent liver transplantation. Recurrence related SNPs were selected and validated.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HCC tissues
