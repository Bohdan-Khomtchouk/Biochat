TITLE
Gingival Epithelial Cell Responses to a Complex Microbiome Comprising Commensal and Opportunistic Oral Microbial Species

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by mono- and complex co-culture with oral commensal S. gordonii and pathogenic P. gingivalis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying infection and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: infection state

DESIGN
Gingival epithelial HIGK cells were sham infected (CTRL) and infected with either the oral commensal S. gordonii (Sg) or the pathogenic P. gingivalis (Pg) as well as co-cultured in mixed cultures of Sg and Pg (Sg+Pg). These samples were hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Understanding how host cells have adapted to commensals, and how barrier cells respond to limit their impact, provides a mechanistic biological basis of health in the mixed bacterial-human ecosystem of the oral cavity and provides insight on how the degree of complexity of a microbiome influences this balance.
