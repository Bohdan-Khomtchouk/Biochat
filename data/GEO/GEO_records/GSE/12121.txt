TITLE
Gingival Epithelial Cell Responses to a Complex Microbiome Comprising Commensal and Opportunistic Oral Microbial Species

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling was utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by mono- and complex co-culture with oral commensal S. gordonii and pathogenic P. gingivalis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying infection and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: infection state
