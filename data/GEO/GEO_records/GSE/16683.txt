TITLE
Human endothelial gene expression under estradiol treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were used to investigate global gene expression patterns in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to 1 nmol/L estradiol for 24 hours, compared to control cells.

DESIGN
HUVEC from 9 separate cultures were exposed to control (0.1% ethanol) and 1nmol/L estradiol treatments for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted. Equal amounts of RNA extracted from 3 control cells or 3 estradiol-treated cells obtained from three different cultures were pooled, achieving three biological replicates of the control and three that were treated with estradiol. Therefore, a total number of 6 microarrays were developed.
