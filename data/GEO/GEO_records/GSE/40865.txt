TITLE
Global gene expression analysis for neuron stem cells (NSC) derived from iPSCs with Fanconi Anemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a recessive disorder associated with genomic instability We generated iPSC from FA patient fibroblasts and further corrected the mutated FANCA gene with a homologous recombination-based approach.

DESIGN
The NSCs were differentiated from control-iPSCs, FA-iPSCs, and corrected FA-NSCs, and their gene expressions were determined by microarray analysis.
