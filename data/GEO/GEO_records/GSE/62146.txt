TITLE
Rapid neurogenesis through transcriptional activation in human stem cell (Agilent)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advances in cellular reprogramming and stem cell differentiation now enable ex vivo studies of human neuronal differentiation. However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two murine Neurogenin transcription factors in human induced pluripotent stem cells, and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in four days at greater than 90% purity. The high purity enabled mRNA and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the transition from stem cell to neuron. These profiles were then analyzed to identify the regulatory networks underlying the differentiation of the neurons. The arrays presented here assessed the differences between single neurogenin and dual neurogenin expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling (microarray) of iPS cells (PGP1) at X days post- doxycycline induction of juman NEUROG1 and/or NEUROG2, or murine Neurog1 and Neurog2.
