TITLE
Suppression of inflammation in psoriasis blood after IL-17 treatment with ixekizumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of anti-IL-17 treatment on systemic inflammation is not fully understand. Using cDNA microarray, genomic analysis methods such as GSEA and ingenuity, we characterized the transcriptional changes in the blood of psoriasis patients afer systemic neutralization of IL-17 compared to baseline (before treatment).  We also compared the whole blood-derived transcriptome between psoraisis patients at baseline and healthy volunteers to examine systemic inflammation in psoriasis patients.

DESIGN
total RNA was extratced from whole blood from psoriasis patients at baseline and after two weeks of treatment; total RNA was extracted from the whole blood of healthy individuals
