TITLE
Stonewalling Drosophila stem cell differentiation by epigenetic controls

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Abstract: During Drosophila oogenesis, germline stem cell (GSC) identity is maintained largely by preventing the expression of factors that promote differentiation. This is accomplished via the activity of several genes acting either in the GSC or its niche. The translational repressors, Nanos and Pumilio, act in GSCs to prevent differentiation, likely by inhibiting translation of early differentiation factors, while niche signals prevent differentiation by silencing transcription of the differentiation factor Bam. We have found that the DNA-associated protein Stonewall (Stwl) is also required for GSC maintenance. stwl is required cell-autonomously; clones of stwl- germ cells were lost by differentiation, and ectopic Stwl caused an expansion of GSCs. stwl mutants acted as Suppressors of Variegation, indicating stwl normally acts in chromatin-dependent gene repression. In contrast to several previously described GSC maintenance factors, Stwl likely functions epigenetically to prevent GSC differentiation. Stwl-dependent transcriptional repression does not target bam, but rather Stwl represses the expression of many genes, including those that may be targeted by Nanos/Pumilio translational inhibition.

DESIGN
Genetic variation comparison between germ cells of Drosophila ovaries from bam mutant and stwl bam double mutant females. Six total samples were analyzed, with each genotype performed in triplicates.
