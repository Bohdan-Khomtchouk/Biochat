TITLE
Dose dependent toxicological response of lung cells exposed to silica nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression to distinguish the effect of Fumed Silica Nanoparticles on human alveolar epithelial A549 lung cells. Cells were exposed in vitro, and datasets of differentially expressed genes were identified for NPs versus control samples.

DESIGN
NPs induced gene expression in A549 cells was measured at 24 hours and 72 hours after exposure. Minimum three independent experiments were performed for each experiment.
