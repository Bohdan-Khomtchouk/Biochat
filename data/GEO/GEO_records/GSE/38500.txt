TITLE
Gene specific signatures by H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 modifications during retina maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Control of neural organogenesis is a complex process and the epigenetic contribution is largely unknown. Here we have followed the genome-wide distribution of two important histone H3 modifications, H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 during late mouse retina development. We found that genes expressed only in mature rod photoreceptors, have a unique signature consisting of de-novo accumulation of H3K4me2 both at the transcription start site (TSS) and over the whole gene that correlates with the increase in transcription, but no accumulation of H3K27me3 at any stage. We also found that distribution of H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 on the genes widely expressed is not always associated with their transcriptional levels. Genes without H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 accumulation at any stage represent a group of transcripts never expressed in retina. The epigenetic signatures defined by H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 can distinguish cell-type specific genes from widespread transcripts and may be reflective of cell specificity during retina maturation.

DESIGN
