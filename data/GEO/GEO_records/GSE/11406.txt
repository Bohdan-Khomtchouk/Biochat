TITLE
Expression data in individual grape berries during ripening initation

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarray analyses of thirty-two individual Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon berries sampled from two clusters at fifty-percent ripening initiation.  By delineating four developmental stages of ripening initiation, we demonstrate that color is a statistically significant indicator of transcriptional state during ripening initiation. We report on clustered gene expression patterns which were mined for genes annotated with signal transduction functions in order to advance regulatory network modeling of ripening initiation in grape berries. We also demonstrated that gene expression does not differ statistically significantly at a global level in berries sampled from different plants or different positions in a cluster. Keywords: time course (berry development series)
