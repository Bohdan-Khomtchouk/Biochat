TITLE
ENCODE SUNY RNA Binding Protein Tiling Data for K562 and GM12878

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA Binding Protein immunoprecipitation study for multiple target proteins in K562 & GM12878 cell lines as part of the ENCODE consortium. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Three sample replicates per sample type.  Total input RNA and Negative target RIP (antibody for bacteriophage coat protein) are provided as controls.  Individual samples reflect  reflect biological replicates defined as separate RIP runs (as opposed to technical replicate defined as multiple arrays run with same RIP sample as starting material).

PLATFORM
GPL3111 Affymetrix ENCODE Tiling Array - ANTISENSE - NCBI build 35
