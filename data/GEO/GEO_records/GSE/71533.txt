TITLE
Microenvironmental regulation by miRNAs in pancreatic cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To demonstrate the role of miRNAs in desmoplastic stroma of pancreatic cancer patients sample, we compared the miRNA expression patterns in tumor, stroma  and normal tissue.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples from the pancreatic cancer patients samples. The miRNA expression profiling is done on tumor, stroma and normal tissues seperately using miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array 7'th arrays (Exiqon, Denmark). The expression profiles were background corrected and quantile normalized. Filtering of controls and low expressed probes was done. 755 miRNAs were used to demonstarte the role of miRNAs in tumor and stroma interaction and in carcinogenesis.

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
