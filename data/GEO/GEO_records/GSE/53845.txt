TITLE
40 IPF patients and 8 healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is microscopic spatial and temporal heterogeneity of pathologic changes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue, which may relate to heterogeneity in pathophysiological mediators of disease and clinical progression. We measured gene expression in samples from lung biopsies or explants in order to assess relationships with pathological features and systemic biomarkers.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted directly from lung tissue samples from 40 IPF patients or 8 healthy controls.
