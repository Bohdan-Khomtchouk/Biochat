TITLE
Array-CGH in human glial brain tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Characterization of DNA copy number changes in 54 glial brain tumors using a cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization method. Tumors: 54 fresh-frozen glioma specimens subjected to standard WHO classification. Specimens included astrocytic [3 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 low-grade astrocytic glioma, 3 anaplastic astrocytomas, 31 glioblastomas (of these 3 secondary glioblastomas and 2 gliosarcomas)], oligodendroglial [5 oligodendrogliomas, 3 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas], and 7 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas tumors. One tumor had been classified as glioneuronal neoplasm. Human male and female genomic reference DNA was purchased from Promega (Promega, Madison, WI). The results provide insights into molecular genetic changes associated with gliomagenesis. Keywords: other
