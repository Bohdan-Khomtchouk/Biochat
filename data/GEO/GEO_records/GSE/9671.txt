TITLE
EDL933 in human macrophage THP-1 cells at different time point

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Effect of human macrophages phagocytosis on the global transcriptome of EDL933 at different time. Infection of THP-1 with EDL933. Application of SCOTS technique to have cDNA. Hybridation on microarray. Reference: EDL933 in RPMI medium Keywords: stres response, host-bacteria response, time-course

DESIGN
For each time point, 2 microarray are analysed and on each microarray there is 2 replicate Total of 4 replicate for each time point (including reference medium)

PLATFORM
