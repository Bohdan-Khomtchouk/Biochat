TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae temperature-sensitive strains specific for SCF core components (Skp1, Cullin (Cdc53), E2 enzyme (Cdc34)) and the F-box protein Cdc4.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The target of rapamycin (TOR) plays a central role in eukaryotic cell growth control. With prevalent hyper-activation of the mTOR pathway in human cancers, novel strategies to enhance TOR pathway inhibition are highly desirable. We used a yeast-based high-throughput chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs) and used whole genome expression analysis to identify their mechanisms of action.
