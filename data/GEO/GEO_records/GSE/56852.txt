TITLE
Gene expression profiling from pooled samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue of NAPE-WT or NAPE-KO mice fed either with a control diet or a high-fat diet.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice knocked-out or wild type for the NAPE PLD gene specifically in adipose tissue, were recruited for this expression profiling experiment. Each group of mice (WT versus cKO) were fed with a control diet or a high fat diet. Then mice were sacrificed and adipose tissue samples form the subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed for RNA extraction. Total RNA of each sample was then pooled with those of the same group and treatment for microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
two groups of mice: (I) NAPE PLD WT and NAPE PLD KO. Each group was submitted to a diet treatment: (I) control diet and (II) high fat diet.
