TITLE
Small RNA and AGO1 CLIP-seq libraries of female Aedes aegypti fat body

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
In this work, we aimed to explore miRNA expression and potential targets in the female fat body of the Ae. aegypti mosquito, as well as their changes as a result of blood meal. The fat body is the metabolic center of the insect organism, playing a key role in reproduction. Therefore, understanding of regulatory networks controlling its functions is critical, and the role of miRNAs in the process is largely unknown. Small RNA library analyses revealed four unique miRNA clusters sequentially expressed during the post blood meal (PBM) phase, drawing connections to waves of upstream hormonal signals and gene expression in the same period. To link the miRNA identities with specific downstream targets, transcriptome-wide mRNA 3' UTR interaction sites were experimentally determined at 72 h post eclosion (PE) and 24 h PBM by means of AGO1 CLIP-seq. Hence, the presented manuscript comprehensively elucidated miRNA expression and target dynamics in female mosquito fat body, providing a solid foundation for future functional studies of miRNA regulation during the gonadotrophic cycle.

DESIGN
