Gene expression in whole lung and pulmonary macrophages reflects the dynamic pathology associated with airway surface dehydration

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpress the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (Scnn1b) in airway Club cells.  The general phenotype of these mice is described in three published manuscripts (Mall et al. 2004, Nature Medicine, 10(5):487-93;  Mall et al. 2008, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 177(7):730-42; and Livraghi-Butrico et al. 2012, Physiol. Genomics 44(8):470-84. Briefly, overexpression of the Scnn1b transgene in airway Club cells leads to hyperabsorption of sodium from the airway surface liquid, dehydrated airway surface liquid and mucus, and reduced mucus clearance associated with accumulation of mucus plugs/plaques.  The data provided here represents mRNA expression data from disseccted whole trachea (distal and proximal ends cut 3-4 cartliage rings below the larynx and just above the bifurcation, respectively) from male WT and Scnn1b-Tg littermates (C57Bl/6NTac background) at 4 time points [postnatal days (PND) 0, 3, 10, and 42].  PND 0 trachea are histologically normal, a tracheal mucus plug/obstruction develops around PND 3, the plug is receding to more distal airways by PND 10, and the trachea is again histologically normal by PND 42.  The data from the WT mice provides a global look at mRNA changes across time, while the data from the Scnn1b-Tg line provides mRNA data that allows differential gene expression due to mucus obstruction to be queried. The data presented for the purified is part of a larger body of work evaluating gene expression in whole lung, trachea, and purified macrophages.

DESIGN
30 total macrophage samples were analyzed;  three from each timepoint (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42) for both wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice grown in specific-pathogen-free facilities and from postnatal day 42 wildtype and Scnn1b-transgenic mice maintained in a germ-free facility.  In our manuscript, we were most interested in changes between WT and Scnn1b-Tg mice, however, the data can also be used to evaluate changes in gene expression across time (postnatal day 0, 3, 10, and 42).  This data can also be used to evaluate the differences in macrophage biology at postnatal day 42 when mice are grown in specific-pathogen-free versus germ-free environments.
