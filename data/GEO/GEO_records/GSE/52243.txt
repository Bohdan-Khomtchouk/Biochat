TITLE
Identification of novel mechanosensitive genes differentially regulated at 48 h timepoint in vivo using mouse carotid   artery endothelium exposed to disturbed blood flow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently, we showed that disturbed ﬂow caused by a partial ligation ofmouse carotid artery rapidly induces atherosclerosis. Analysis of mechanosenstive microRNA in the mouse carotid endothelium.  In this study, we examined the microRNAs that respond differentially to blood flow pattern in the mouse carotid endothelium.  We surgically induced disturbed blood flow in the left common carotid cartery (LCA) using partial carotid ligation surgery while the right carotid artery was left undisturbed.  The hypothesis tested here is that turbulent or disturbed blood flow across the left carotid artery endothelium will affect endothelial genes and microRNAS.  Identifying flow-sensitive microRNAs will provide important information about how endothelium responds to d-flow and regulates endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis. Deter-  mining the functional importance of these novel mechanosensitive microRNAS may provide important insights into understanding vascular biology and atherosclerosis.

DESIGN
We used 6- to 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) according to the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol by Emory University. Mice were subjected to partial carotid ligation surgery under anesthesia.  Brieﬂy, 3 of 4 caudal branches of LCA (left external carotid, internal carotid, and occipital artery) were ligated with 6-0 silk suture, although the superior thyroid artery was left intact. Development of low and oscillatory blood flow in the Left Carotid Artery of each mouse was determined by ultrasound measurements.
