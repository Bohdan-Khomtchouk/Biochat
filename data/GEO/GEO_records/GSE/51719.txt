TITLE
Expression analysis of murine splenic B-cells after retroviral transduction with a constitutively active variant of IRF5 (IRF5-4D)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of murine splenic B-cells following retroviral transduction with a constitutively active IRF5 (IRF5-4D)

DESIGN
Illumina WG-6 v2.0 arrays were hybridized to determine the gene expression profile of murine splenic B-cells following retroviral transduction with i) control virus (MSCV-IRES-CFP) or ii) IRF5-4D virus (MSCV-IRF5-4D-CFP). All hybridizations were done in biological triplicates.
