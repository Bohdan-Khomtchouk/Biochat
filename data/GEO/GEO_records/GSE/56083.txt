TITLE
Determining the M. smegmatis DosR regulon

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
DosR is the regulator of a two-component system in mycobacteria that senses oxygen concentration and the redox state of the cells.

DESIGN
To determine the DosR regulon, the transcriptomes of M. smegmatis mc2155 and the Î”dosR cells were compared by microarray at 10 hours following induction of oxygen-limitation in serum vials. 4 biological replicates  incl. 2 dye swaps. 3 technical replicates per array

PLATFORM
GPL5862 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium smegmatis 25K v4 array designed primarily based on strain MC2 155
