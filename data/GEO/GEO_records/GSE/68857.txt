TITLE
Transcriptional effects of CTGF inhibition in a transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac structural changes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) include cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis.  Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) has been associated with tissue remodeling and is highly expressed in failing hearts.  To test if inhibition of CTGF would alter the course of cardiac remodeling and preserve cardiac function in the protein kinase Cε (PKCε) mouse model of DCM.  Transgenic mice expressing constitutively active PKCε in cardiomyocytes develop cardiac dysfunction that was evident by 3 months of age, and that progressed to heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, and increased mortality.  Beginning at 3 months of age, mice were treated with an antibody to CTGF (FG-3149) or non-immune IgG control antibody for an additional 3 months.  CTGF inhibition significantly improved left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in PKCε mice, and slowed the progression of LV dilatation.  Using gene arrays and quantitative PCR, the expression of many genes associated with tissue remodeling were elevated in PKCε mice, but significantly decreased by CTGF inhibition, however total collagen deposition was not attenuated.  The observation of significantly improved LV function by CTGF inhibition in PKCε mice suggests that CTGF inhibition may benefit patients with DCM.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the left ventricle of 6-month-old PKCε transgenic mice or nontransgenic FVB/N controls 3 months after initiation of treatment with IgG (n=10 biological replicates each) or anti-CTGF antibody FG-3149 (n=12 each) and hybridized to Affymetrix 430A 2.0 microarrays.  CEL files were processed by GCRMA and rescaled using median per-gene normalization in GeneSpring GX 7.3.1.
