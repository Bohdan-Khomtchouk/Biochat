Global gene expression profiles and the progression of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in mouse models

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gaucher Disease (GD) is caused by defective glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and the consequent accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide (GC). This excess of accumulation of GC leads to broad functional impairments in multiple organs, but the pathogenic pathways leading to lipid laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) in visceral organs and their abnormal function is obscure.  To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GD, developmental global gene expression was conducted by microarray analyses of total mRNAs from lung and liver of two distinct GCase point-mutated mice (V394L/V394L and D409V/null) and genetic background matched wild-type controls.  INFg regulated pro-inflammatory and IL-4 regulated anti-inflammatory  cytokine/mediator network were constructed in the lung and liver of GCase mutant mice. Progressive alterations of the INFg and IL-4 pathways were similar, but to different degrees, in visceral tissues from the two different GCase mutated mice. These analyses implicate IFNg regulated pro-inflammatory and IL-4 regulated anti-inflammatory networks in the differential pathophysiological progression.
