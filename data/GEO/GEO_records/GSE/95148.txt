TITLE
Gene expression-based, molecular pathomechanism prediction for GNE myopathy I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Molecular impacts of 0.1% N-acetylcysteine treatment on GNE myopathy model mice were well described through expression profiling of a total of 34000 genes

DESIGN
In the study presented here, genetically defined GNE myopathy model mice were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 34000 unique genes, for identification  of  pathomechanism of the disease and the theraputic pathways with N-acetylcysteine treatment.
