TITLE
Expression data of sciatic nerves from mice with Schwann-cell specific Sip1 deletion compared to control mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Schwann cell maturation is tightly controlled by a set of transcriptional regulators. We have deleted the zinc-finger transcription factor Sip1 specifically from immature Schwann cells and observed a dramatic developmental delay. In an attempt to define the developmental stage of Sip1-deficient Schwann cells, we performed microarray analysis of Schwann cell-specific mutants compared to controls at the age of 25 days (P25).

DESIGN
Sciatic nerves of 3 mutant mice and 3 corresponding controls were isolated at the age of 25 days.
