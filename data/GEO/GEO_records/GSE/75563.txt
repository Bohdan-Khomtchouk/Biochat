TITLE
Identification of genes involved in cold shock response in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
A rapid decline in temperature poses a major challenge for poikilothermic fish. The gene expression of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss having undergone such a cold shock (0 °C) and a control (5 °C) were compared in a microarray-based study.

DESIGN
Fish were either incubated in water of ambient temperature (5°C) or cooled water (0°C) for 30 minutes and tissues extracted.
