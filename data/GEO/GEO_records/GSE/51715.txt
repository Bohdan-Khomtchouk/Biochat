TITLE
LATS2 regulated genes in human colon cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate how LATS2 affect Wnt target genes expression, we performed gene expression profiling and comparison in control, LATS2 and LATS2N (1-625, kinase domain deletion) overexpression in human colorectal cancer SW480 cells.

DESIGN
In SW480 cell line, the stable expression of LATS2 or LATS2N was generated. Total RNA was extracted from these 2 samples and control cell line
