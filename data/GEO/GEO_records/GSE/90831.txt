TITLE
Guanabenz effect on activated GM-CSF DCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Guanabenz is an FDA approved drug for hypertension. It has been shown also to be an inhibitor of GADD34, the stress-inducible cofactor of PP1. GADD34 has been shown to play a key role in controlling cytokine production in MEFs and dendritic cells. A microarray-based mRNA transcription analysis was used to compare the transcriptional response of GM-CSF DCs, activated with poly I:C or Proteus mirabilis, in presence or absence of 50ÂµM Guanabenz.

DESIGN
GM-CSF DCs were left untreated or were activated for 8h and 16h with poly I:C (lipofected or soluble) or Proteus mirabilis (with the bacteriostatic Chloramphenicol) . Their RNA content was extracted with a commercial kit for RNA extraction. Three independent experiments were performed.
