TITLE
Expression data analysis in lungs from mice induced for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by inhalation of Stachybotrys chartarum spores

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been reported that repeated intra-tracheal instillation of S. chartarum spores induced significant pulmonary arterial remodeling in mice, which resulted in pathological changes like human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and elevation right ventricle systolic pressure. Then, we used microarrays to know the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of PAH.

DESIGN
Isolates of Stachybotrys chartarum were used. Ddy mice were anesthetized and the spore suspension was intratracheally injected 12 times, i.e. 1Ã—104 spores into each mouse at 4-5 day intervals for 8 weeks. Mice were sacrificed one week after the final injection and then examined. Lung tissue specimens from mice model of PAH (n=3) and normal controls (n=3) were obtained. RNA targets preparation were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using GeneChip(R) 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). One hundred nanograms of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA template for transcription. In vitro transcription synthesized amplified RNA (aRNA) and incorporated a biotin-conjugated nucleotide. After purification and fragmentation of aRNA, 12.5 ug of them was hybridized to GeneChip(R) Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix).The Probe Array was scanned using a GeneChip(R) Scanner 3000 7G.
