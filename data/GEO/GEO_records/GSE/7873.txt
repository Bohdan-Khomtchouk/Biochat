TITLE
Expression data for whole adult tissue; Drosophila males of seven species

ORGANISM
Drosophila mauritiana ; Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila simulans ; Drosophila teissieri ; Drosophila yakuba ; Drosophila santomea

SUMMARY
Co-expression of genes that physically cluster together is a common characteristic of eukaryotic transcriptomes.  Identifying these groups of co-expressed genes is important to the functional annotation of genomes and understanding the evolutionary fates of the clustered genes. We used microarrays to measure gene expression in seven closely related Drosophila species, to identify domains clusters within a species of Drosophila (D. simulans) and that are evolving among species in the D. melanogater subgroup. Keywords: species comparison

DESIGN
Assays were carried out on three independent (biological) replicates per species for a single line of the following five species: D.yakuba (Tuscon Stock Center Number: 14021-0261.00), D.santomea (TSCN: 14021-0271.00), D.teissieri (TSCN: 14021-0257.00), D.mauritiana (David 105, TSCN: 14021-0241.01), D.sechellia (Roberstson, TSCN: 14021-0248.21). Three biological replicates for D.melanogaster.  The samples assayed for D.melanogaster reflect an even genotypic contribution of 10 isogenic lines developed from a wild population (Winters, CA) and crossed in a round-robin design.For D. simulans, three replicate arrays were used to assay each of 10 round-robin crosses between 10 isogenic lines developed from the same population.  the entire data set therefore included a total of 48 independent transcript assays covering seven Drosophila species in the D.melanogaster subgroup
