TITLE
Virtual-Karyotyping with SNP microarrays in morphologically challenging renal cell neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic lesions characteristic for RCC subtypes can be identified by virtual karyotyping with SNP microarrays. In this study, we examined whether virtual karyotypes could be used to better classify a cohort of morphologically challenging/unclassified RCC.

DESIGN
Tumor resection specimens from 17 patients were profiled by virtual karyotyping with Affymetrix 10K 2.0 or 250K Nsp SNP Mapping arrays and were also evaluated independently by a panel of seven genito-urinary pathologists. Tumors were classified by the established pattern of genomic imbalances based on a reference cohort of 98 cases with classic morphology and compared to the morphologic diagnosis of the pathologist panel. In 3 cases, samples from areas with different morphologic appearance were also tested (n=5).
