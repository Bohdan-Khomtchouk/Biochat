TITLE
Doxorubicin enhances nucleosome turnover around promoters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use a metabolic labeling strategy for directly measuring nucleosome turnover to examine the effect of doxorubicin on chromatin dynamics in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from genetically defined mice. We find that doxorubicin enhances nucleosome turnover around gene promoters, and turnover correlates with gene expression level. Keywords: Chromatin affinity-purification on microarray

DESIGN
26 CATCH-IT arrays and 8 expression arrays.
