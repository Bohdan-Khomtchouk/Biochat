TITLE
Integrated analysis of mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq in the liver of Pelteobagrus vachelli in response to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Tachysurus vachellii

SUMMARY
we used next-generation sequencing technology to characterise mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq of control- and hypoxia-treated P. vachelli livers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation. We were able to find miRNA-mRNA pairs using bioinformatics analysis and miRNA prediction algorithms.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different oxygen-treated in Pelteobagrus vachelli (Repeat each treatment has three biology). ----------------------------------- This represents the microRNA component only

PLATFORM
GPL21196 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Tachysurus vachellii)
