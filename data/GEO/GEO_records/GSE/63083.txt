TITLE
Breastfeeding infants transmit influenza virus to the mammary glands during feeding [Dataset Part II]

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
Influenza virus transmission between mothers and nursing-infants has not been investigated although mothers and infants often develop severe disease.  Ferrets are considered the most appropriate model for influenza studies. We investigated influenza transmission in infant and nursing-mother ferrets. Influenza infected infants transmitted virus to mother mammary glands leading to live virus excretion in milk and influenza virus positive mammary gland epithelial cells.  Global gene expression analysis showed down-regulation of milk production and induction of breast involution and oncogenesis pathways.  Our results provide insight into influenza transmission between mothers and infants which may impact fields of infectious disease, maternal/infant health and neoplasm etiology.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from ferret lungs at days 3 and 6 post-intranasal infection with 10^5 EID50 A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (n = 3/time-point).  Total RNA was also collected from uninfected control lung tissues (n = 3).  Changes in gene expression relative to uninfected tissue controls were then investigated.
