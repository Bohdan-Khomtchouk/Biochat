TITLE
Gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis plants during the treatment of AgNO3.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Camalexin, an indolic secondary metabolite, is the magor phytoalexin produced by Arabidopsis thaliana. Camalexin biosynthesis is induced by abiotic stresses such as heavy metal treatment (e.g AgNO3). With the aim of identifying positive regulators of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, we listed putative transcription factor genes strongly induced during the time course of AgNO3 treatment from a transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
AgNO3 induced gene expression in Arabidopsis was measured at 48 and 72 hours after the 0.1 mM AgNO3 treatment. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated under sterile conditions on GM-agar plates. Seedlings (one-week after germination) were then transferred to GM liquid culture and shaken for two weeks. Plants were then treated with 0.1 mM AgNO3 and sampled at 0 h, 48 h and 72 h after the treatment. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (0, 48, or 72 h) using different plants for each experiment.
