TITLE
Proteomic and Genomic Analyses of the Rvb1 and Rvb2 Interaction Network upon Deletion of R2TP Complex Components

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae R2TP protein complex consists of Rvb1, Rvb2, Pih1 and Tah1. The R2TP complex has been implicated in various cellular processes such as assembly of snoRNP complex, RNA polymerase II complex, apoptosis and PIKK signaling. The involvement of R2TP in assembling various complexes seems to be in part due to Pih1 and Tah1, which serve as adapter/recruiter proteins. Here, we have performed high resolution RNA-seq. analyses to identify differential expression levels between wild type and PIH1 and TAH1 deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can help in unraveling other functions of Pih1 and Tah1. Both wild type and deletion strains contained TAP (tandem affinity purification) tag at the C-terminal end of either RVB1 or RVB2.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were performed for each strains
