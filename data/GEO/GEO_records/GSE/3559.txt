TITLE
Variation in cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression using unamplified poly(A)+ RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification BC2 uM This experiment was designed to assess the reproducibility of microarray hybridization using poly(A)+RNA. BC2 total RNA was isolated from which poly(A)+RNA was subsequently isolated. Three arrays were hybridized on the same day using arrays from the same batch. Two were done three months later using poly(A)+RNA freshly isolated from the same total RNA. A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments.
