TITLE
Genome-wide Binding Site Mapping of Retinoic Acid Receptors and Coregulators in Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinoic acid (RA) triggers growth-suppressive effects in tumor cells and therefore RA and its synthetic analogs have great potential as anti-carcinogenic agents. RA effects are mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which regulate gene expression in an RA-dependent manner. To define the genetic network regulated by RARs in breast cancer cells, we identified RAR genomic targets using chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression analysis in a model breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Furthermore, we identified genomic binding sites for two putative RAR coregulators FoxA1 and GATA3. Keywords: ChIP-Chip Analysis

DESIGN
This series contains ChIP-Chip raw data for four transcription factors (RARA, RARG, FoxA1 and GATA3) in MCF-7 cells. All the experiments are done in triplicates. We mapped the binding sites of RARA, RARG and GATA3 in the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic MCF7 cells in which we tagged the transcription factors with a modified LAP (localization and affinity purification) tag containing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Goat anti-GFP (raised against His-tagged full-length eGFP and affinity-purified with GST-tagged full-length eGFP) was used to perform ChIP experiments in those transgenic lines. To map the binding sites of RARs, MCF7 Cells were hormone-deprived for 3 days and then were treated with 100 nM AM580 (RARA-selective agonist) or 100 nM CD437 (RARG-selective agonist) for 1 hour at 80% confluence. FoxA1 binding sites were mapped using goat anti-FoxA1 antibodies (Abcam: ab5089). Control data include Input from MCF-7 cells. ChIP-Chip experiments with eGFP antibody in wide type MCF-7 cells are used to control eGFP antibody non-specific binding.
