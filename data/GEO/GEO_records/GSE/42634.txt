TITLE
methylation profile of dermal MSCs derived from psoriasis patients and normal control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several studies have suggested that MSCs have pleiotropic immuno-modulatory effects,  including inhibition of T cell proliferation, suppression of NK cells proliferation, modulation of cytokine production, and inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) maturation etc. But the exactly mechanism are still largely unclear.We have found that the gene expression profile of psoriatic dermal MSCs was distinct different from normal MSCs. We proposed to investigate the DNA methylation profile of psoriatic MSCs.

DESIGN
6 patients and 6 normal control were inrolled in the study, the DNA methylation profile of dermal MSCs were studied using the microarry.
