TITLE
cFos-Sox9 Axis Reprograms Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Chondroblastic Osteosarcoma [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to profile cFos binding sites in an p53 knockout mouse bone marrow-derived stem cells (mBMSCs).

DESIGN
Fifty million of p53 knockout (p53KO) mBMSCs expressing cFos were fixed and subjected to ChIP-seq assay using 10 ug anti-cFos antibody (Santa Cruz, Cat:sc-253).

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
