TITLE
RNA-Seq gene expression analysis of ΔgsrN, gsrN-OE, and wild-type Caulobacter crescentus

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Purpose: Define steady state levels of transcripts in different gsrN mutants Methods: Sequenced total RNA purified from from cell extracts of gsrN mutants Results: We report differences in transcript levels between wild type, ΔgsrN, and gsrN-overexpression(OE) strains

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from four independent cultures (each) of Caulobacter crescentus ΔgsrN, gsrN-OE, and wild-type strains grown to 0.85-0.90 OD600 in M2-xylose medium. mRNA steady state levels in these strains were determined by mapping reads to the Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 genome (CP001340).
