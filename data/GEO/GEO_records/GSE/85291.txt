TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures after knocking down of miR-132 in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To further development of the gene expression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that are regulated in miR-132 knockdown zebrafish. Zebrafish larvae were injected with Control MO or miR-132 MO at one-cell stage. Then the upregulated genes are combined to the miRNA prediction alagorithm. 21 genes were picked up and verifed by luciferase assay.

DESIGN
The total RNA was extracted from 3 dpf zebrafish injected with 8 ng control or miR-132 MO MO. The RNA was applied for the microarray gene proliling

PLATFORM
GPL14664 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Probe Name version)
