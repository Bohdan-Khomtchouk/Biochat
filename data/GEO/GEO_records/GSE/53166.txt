TITLE
Expression data measured by microarray of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy individuals stimulated with LPS, influenza, or left unstimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Variation in individuals' responses to environmental factors is believed to influence susceptibility to complex diseases in humans. The genetic basis of such variation is poorly understood. We measured gene expression from resting and stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) derived from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. We stimulated the primary DCs with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or influenza virus. Using serial replicate samples, we selected genes that showed evidence of reproducibility within the serial replicates.

DESIGN
We collected peripheral blood from each human donor. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Ficoll, and magnetically sorted them for CD14+CD16- monocytes. We then differentiated the monocytes into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) by culturing the cells for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-4. We stimulated the cells with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 5 hr or influenza (PR8 dNS1) for 10 hr. Finally, we lysed the cells and isolated total RNA for microarray.
