TITLE
Identification of IL-23 target genes in intestinal CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-23 negatively regulates St2 and Gata3 expression in intestinal CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
Colitis was induced by co-transfer of WT and Il23r-/- na√Øve CD4 T cells into Rag1-/- recipients. Upon development of clinical signs of inflammation WT and Il23r-/- CD4+ T cells were sort-purified from the colon lamina propria on the basis of congenic markers. Total RNA was extracted immediately after the sort without further manipulation.
