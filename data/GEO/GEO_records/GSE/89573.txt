TITLE
Cbx3 Maintains Lineage Specificity During Neural Differentiation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cbx3 (HP1Î³) that is a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 familiy enriched in gene bodies of pluripotent ESCs but promoters of differentiated pre-iPSCs. To determine whether Cbx3 becomes enriched at promoters to influence gene regulation during differentiation, we converted ESCs to NPCs in monolayer culuture and performed genomewide ChIP-seq of Cbx3. Our results shows that Cbx3 enriches at the promoters of genes upon differentiation of ESCs to NPCs and stablizes the binding of Mediator subunit Med26 to pre-initiation complex (PIC) in NPCs.

DESIGN
Examine the enrichment of Cbx3 and Pol II in wild-type ESC-derived NPCs, and the enrichment of Med26, Cdk8 and Pol II in NPC transfected with control siRNA targeting luciferase or siRNA mediated knockdown of Cbx3 by ChIP-seq analysis.
