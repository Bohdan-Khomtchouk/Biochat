TITLE
Expression data from juvenile Xenopus laevis inner ear tissue

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
We implemented a functional genomics approach as a means to undertake a large-scale analysis of the Xenopus laevis inner ear transcriptome through microarray analysis. Microarray analysis uncovered genes within the X. laevis inner ear transcriptome associated with inner ear function and impairment in other organisms, thereby supporting the inclusion of Xenopus in cross-species genetic studies of the inner ear.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of Xenopus laevis juvenile inner ear tissue.  Inner ear RNA isolated from three groups of 5-10 juvenile X. laevis. Each biological replicate represents pooled inner ear RNA from 10-19 inner ears.
