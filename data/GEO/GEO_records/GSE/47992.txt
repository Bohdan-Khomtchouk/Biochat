TITLE
Genome wide expression profiling of 30 urothelial cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a panel of urothelial cancer cells. The goal of the study is to exam the genome wide expression profile in each of the 30 urothelial cancer cells tested in our laboratory

DESIGN
Each of the 30 cell lines was DNA fingerprinted to confirm its real identity. Total RNA was obtained from each cell line and subjected to illumina expression profiling microarray
