TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Fusion Negative Rhabdomyosarcoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the expression of two fusion-negative established Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Together with Chip-seq, we were able to identify transcribed loci bound by myogenic regulatory transcription factors (MYF5 and MYOD) that pertain to embryonic muscle development and cell cycle regulation pathways.  Keywords: rhabdomyosarcoma, gene expression profiling, RD, Rh18

DESIGN
We compared the transcription profiles of 2 FN-RMS cell lines by RNA-seq analysis.

PLATFORM
