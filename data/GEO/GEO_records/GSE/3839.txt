TITLE
Temporal expression profile of megakaryocytic differentiation primary CD34+ cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of Mk differentiation human CD34-positive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells cultured with thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and Flt3-ligand.  The goal this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of Mk differentiation including commitment, polyploidization, proplatelet formation, and apoptosis. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood CD34-positive cells were cultured with TPO, IL-3, and Flt3-L to induce Mk differentiation.  Samples prior to day 5, including uncultured starting cells,  were analyzed directly, whereas samples after and including day 5 were positively selected for CD41a expression immediately prior to RNA isolation.  Three biological replicate experiments were analyzed and approximately one-half of the samples from each experiment were technically replicated.  Hybridizations were performed in a reference design with all samples labeled with Cy3 and a reference RNA pool labeled with Cy5.
