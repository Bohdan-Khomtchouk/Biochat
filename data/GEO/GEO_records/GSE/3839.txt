TITLE
Temporal expression profile of megakaryocytic differentiation primary CD34+ cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of Mk differentiation human CD34-positive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells cultured with thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and Flt3-ligand.  The goal this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of Mk differentiation including commitment, polyploidization, proplatelet formation, and apoptosis. Keywords: time course
