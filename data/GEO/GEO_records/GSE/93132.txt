TITLE
Impact of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on toxicokinetics of tetrachloroethylene in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the effect of NAFLD on liver gene expression changes that could impact tetrachloroethhylene metabolism Methods: We fed male C57Bl/6J mice a base diet (BD), high fat (HFD), or methionine/choline/folate deficient high fat diet (MCD) for 8 weeks and then treated them with vehicle or tetrachloroethylene (PERC, 300 mg/kg ig). We only report " basal " differences herein (aka vehicle-treated). Results: We report that there were diet-specific differences in xenobiotic metabolizing genes, and that these genes may be responsible for NAFLD-induced disruption in PERC metabolism

DESIGN
Examination of liver left lobe gene expression for 3 different diets fed to C57Bl/6J male mice
