Retinoic acid directs the development and transcriptional programming of intestinal dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This file contains gene microarray data from bone marrow pre-ul DC, in vitro derived CD103+CD11b+ and CD103+CD11b- cDC with or without retinoic acid.

DESIGN
We analyze transcript expression data from bone marrow pre-uDC, Splenic and SI cDC1 and cDC2 (GSE15907 - 18 samples), in vitro derived CD103+CD11b+ and CD103+CD11b- cDC from C57Bl/6 mice. The complete dataset is linked below as a supplementary file.
