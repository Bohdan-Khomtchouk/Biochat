TITLE
Circadian Liver Gene Expression in Animals on Normal Chow or High Fat Diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circadian and metabolic processes are codependent. This experiment was designed to understand how a high fat diet affects circadian gene expression in the liver. Circadian gene expression in the liver is necessary for energy balance.

DESIGN
Animals consuming normal chow or high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for ten weeks were analyzed for circadian gene expression. Livers were harvested from animals every four hours throughout the circadian cycle.
