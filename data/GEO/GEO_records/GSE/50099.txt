TITLE
Comparative miRNA expression of normal skin from control and lesional skin from mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against either interleukin (IL)-17 or the IL-17 receptor in psoriasis therapy provides strong evidence that IL-17 is the major inflammatory mediation in this disease. However, how IL-17 induces epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that IL-17 actives NF-kB in keratinocytes and initiates the NF-kB-dependent transcription of microRNA-31 (miR-31), one of the most abundant microRNAs in the epidermis of lesional skin of psoriasis and two related mouse models. Similar to IL-17 deficiency (IL-17-/-), knocking out miR-31 (miR-31-/-) or targeting it by antagomir-31 prevents keratinocytes Ki67 expression and inhibits acanthosis and dermal inflammation in psoriasis mouse model. Moreover, PPP6c, a negative regulator restricting G0/G1 to G2/M phase progression in the cell cycle, is diminished in human psoriatic epidermis and is directly targeted by miR-31. Inhibition of ppp6c is functionally important for the biological effects of miR-31 in the development of epidermal hyperplasia. Thus, our data define IL-17-inducede miR-31 and its target ppp6c as critical factors for hyperproliferative epidermis in psoriasis.

DESIGN
Epidermis samples from affected ears derived from 3 CD18hypo PL/J mice (DIS) or normal ears derived from 3 CD18hypo C57BL/6J mice(2128) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to compare miRNA expression of normal skin from control and lesional skin.
