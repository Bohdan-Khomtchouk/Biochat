TITLE
ChIP-seq assays for H3K9me2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide chromatin states in Zscan4 positive ES cells (Em+) and Zscan4 negative ES cells (Em-) by using FACS-sorted MC1-ZE7 ES cells. H3K27 hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation were detected in heterochromatic regions of Em+ cells. These results suggested that the heterochromatin is activated in Zscan4 positive state.

DESIGN
H3K9me2 in Zscan4 positive and negative cells
