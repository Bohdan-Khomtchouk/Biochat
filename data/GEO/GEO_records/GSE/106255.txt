TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed circRNAs in OLF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ossification of the ligamentum flava (OLF) is a common spinal disorder among the elderly that causes myelopathy and radiculopathy. Although studies have identified several genes that correlated with OLF, the underlying regulation network is far from clear. To identify transcriptional regulators for OLF, we compared the circRNAs expression of the ligamentum flava tissues from OLF patients and healthy volunteers through microarray analysis, which revealed a panel of circRNAs that were specifically regulated in ligament tissues of human undergoing ossification. To identify transcriptional regulators for OLF, we compared the circRNAs expression of the ligamentum flava tissues from OLF patients and healthy volunteers through microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The circRNA expression profile of 4 OLFs and 4 normal LF tissues were analyzed by microarray analysis.
