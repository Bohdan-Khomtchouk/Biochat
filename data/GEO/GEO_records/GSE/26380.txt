TITLE
Bj110 DMSO vs. Pterocarpan 6 (P6)

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Bj110 cells treated with P6 (20 uM for 24 h).

DESIGN
Three independent biological materials were prepared for cells treated with P6 or DMSO (vehicle control). A total 6 arrays which includes dye swap were analyzed.
