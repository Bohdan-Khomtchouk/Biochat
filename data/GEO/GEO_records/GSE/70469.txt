TITLE
Expression data from antigen-specific CD4+T cells from peripheral blood of patietns with CD and healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract. We performed a whole-genome transcriptional analysis using sorted commensal antigen-specific CD4+T cells from peripheral blood of CD patients and from healthy controls.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood sorted FlaX, Fla2 and YidX-specific CD4+T cells from Crohn's disease patients and from non-inflammatory controls were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Inclusion criteria for CD patients were: age between 18 and 70, diagnosis of CD established at least 4 months before inclusion and exclusion of concomitant infection.
