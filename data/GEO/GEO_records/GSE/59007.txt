TITLE
Fluvastatin-induced differential global gene expression in human metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study analyzed the altered expression profiles of genes that are responsible for fluvastatin-induced breast cancer cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells (ER-ve basal breast cancer cells). Some of these altered gene expressions were further inter connceted to various pathways which may eventually be recognised as drug targets/ biomarkers in statin-sensitve breast cancer patients.

DESIGN
To understand the differential gene expression profile in fluvastatin treated (24 h) malignant breast cancer cells with untreated malignant breast cancer cells.
