TITLE
A G Protein-Coupled Receptor with a Lipid Kinase Domain Is Involved in Cell-Density Sensing.

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
One mechanism multicellular structures use for controlling cell number [1, 2] involves the secretion and sensing of a factor, such as leptin [3] or myostatin [4], in mammals. Dictyostelium cells secrete autocrine factors for sensing cell density prior to aggregation and multicellular development [5, 6] such as CMF (conditioned-medium factor), which enables starving cells to respond to cAMP pulses [7, 8, 9]. Its actions are mediated by two receptors. CMFR1 activates a G protein-independent signaling pathway regulating gene expression [10]. An unknown Gα1-dependent receptor activates phospholipase C (PLC), which regulates the lifetime of Gα2-GTP [11, 12, 13]. Here, we describe RpkA, an unusual seven-transmembrane receptor that is fused to a C-terminal PIP5 kinase domain and that localizes in membranes of a late endosomal compartment. Loss of RpkA resulted in formation of persistent loose aggregates and altered expression of cAMP-regulated genes. The developmental defect can be rescued by full-length RpkA and the transmembrane domain only. The PIP5 kinase domain is dispensable for the developmental role of RpkA. rpkA− cells secrete and bind CMF but are unable to induce downstream responses. Inactivation of Gα1, a negative regulator of CMF signaling, rescued the developmental defect of the rpkA− cells, suggesting that RpkA actions are mediated by Gα1.
