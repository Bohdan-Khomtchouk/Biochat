TITLE
Amniotic microRNA profile of normal delivery at term

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amnion is a vital structure for human parturition, and it is anatomically compartmentalized into the placental amnion and the reflected amnion. microRNA expression was profiled to determine the expression pattern and its significance in the placental amnion and the reflected amnion in association with spontaneous labor at term.
