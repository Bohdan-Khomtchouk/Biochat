SUMMARY
Forty male C57BL6 mice 12-15 weeks old fed chow ad libitum. 30 mice underwent adrenalectomy (Adx) and 10 others a sham-Adx. Three or 24 h before tissue sampling, groups of 10 mice received an I.P. injection of cortisol (0.1 mg per mice), while the remaining Adx and intact mice received an I.P. injection of the vehicle (ethanol) 24 h prior to the sacrifice. All mice were killed within a period of a few hours. Gastrocnemius muscle were dissected and pooled together for each one of the four groups. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol. Keywords: other
