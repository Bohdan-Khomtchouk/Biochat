TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of OsbZIP48 rice transgenics

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice transgenic plants of the bZIP encoding gene, OsbZIP48, in the Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) variety have been found to display differences in the total height. In order to elucidate changes at the transcriptome level, microarray of the  10-day-old seedlings of over-expresseion (OE) and knock-down (KD) lines along with vector control (VC) were carried out.
