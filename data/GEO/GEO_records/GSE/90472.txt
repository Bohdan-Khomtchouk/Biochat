TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of OsbZIP48 rice transgenics

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice transgenic plants of the bZIP encoding gene, OsbZIP48, in the Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) variety have been found to display differences in the total height. In order to elucidate changes at the transcriptome level, microarray of the  10-day-old seedlings of over-expresseion (OE) and knock-down (KD) lines along with vector control (VC) were carried out.

DESIGN
Seedlings of OsbZIP48-OE, OsbZIP48-KD and VC  grown for seven days at 28Â±1oC in light. RNA from the whole seedlings were extracted from each sample and hybridized on rice Affymetrix microarrays. Two biological replicates of each sample were used for microarray analysis. Overall, ten samples were analyzed representing the transgenic lines and vector control constructs.
