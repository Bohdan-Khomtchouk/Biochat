TITLE
Chd4 deficiency effect on mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study reveal that Chd4 is essential for stemness maintenance of ESCs. As Chd4 deficient ESCs show attentuated self-renewal ability and induced differentiation marker gene expression. To confirm the effect of Chd4 on the transcriptome profile of ESCs, we performed microarray analyses for Chd4 deficient ESCs.

DESIGN
We used the Tet-on inducible RNAi cell lines to achieve Chd4 knockdown. we performed microarray assays from 2 experimental groups with biological duplicate samples, Chd4i-1 cells treated with 5 ng/ml doxycyline for 3 days as the experimental group and without Dox treatment as the control group.
