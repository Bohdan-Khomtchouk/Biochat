TITLE
Global Microarray Analysis of Bacillus sp. N16-5 Salt Stress Adaptation

ORGANISM
Bacillus sp. N16-5

SUMMARY
The alkaliphilic halotolerant bacterium Bacillus sp. N16-5 often faces salt stress in its natural habitats. One-color microarrays was used to investigate transcriptome expression profiles of Bacillus sp. N16-5 adaptation reactions to prolonged grown at different salinities (0%, 2%, 8% and 15% NaCl) and the initial reaction to suddenly alter salinity from 0% to 8% NaCl.

DESIGN
Salt induced gene expression was measured when culture was grown on different salinities (0%, 2%, 8% and 15% NaCl) to mid-logarithmic phase. And salt induced gene expression was also measured at 0 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60min, 120min after a sudden change salinity from 0% to 8% NaCl.
