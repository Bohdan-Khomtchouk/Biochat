TITLE
effect of redox on gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study, we used GC-MS analysis in combination with flux analysis and the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip to survey the metabolome and transcriptome of Arabidopsis leaves in response to manipulation of the thiol-disulfide status. Feeding low concentrations of the sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) for one hour at the end of the dark period led to post-translational redox-activation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and major alterations in leaf carbon partitioning, including an increased flux into major respiratory pathways, starch- cell-wall-, and amino-acid synthesis and a reduced flux to sucrose. This was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of hexose-phosphates, while metabolites in the second half of the TCA cycle and various amino acids increased, indicating a stimulation of anaplerotic fluxes reliant on Î±-ketoglutarate. There was also an increase in shikimate as a precursor of secondary plant products and marked changes in the levels of the minor sugars involved in ascorbate synthesis and cell wall metabolism. Transcript profiling revealed a relatively small number of changes in the levels of transcripts coding for components of redox-regulation, transport processes and cell wall, protein and amino acid metabolism, while there were no major alterations in transcript levels coding for enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways. These results provide a global picture of the effect of redox and reveal the utility of transcript and metabolite profiling as systemic strategies to uncover the occurrence of redox-modulation in vivo.
