TITLE
ligand-activated and -unactivated AHR in wiltype and mutant hepatoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Starting with our early global expression analyses of TCDD-treated human hepatoma cells {Puga, 2000 4679 /id}, the AHR transcriptional induction profile has been extensively studied, whether activated by TCDD, B[a]P or in the absence of exogenous ligands (reviewed in {Frericks, 2007 5618 /id}).  In addition to using prior knowledge to integrate expression profiles into the AHR gene target network, we performed a new set of expression profile analyses of wild type Hepa-1c1c7 and c35 cell lines and compared the responses in naïve cells with responses in TCDD or B[a]P exposed cells for 8 hours.  Results of our expression array studies are in close agreement with current knowledge.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were each performed for wildype naïve cells  (DMSO), TCDD activated cells, and B[a]P activated cells, and for c35 (AHR mutant) naïve cells (DMSO), TCDD activated cells, and B[a]P activated cells.
