TITLE
Evaluation of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 gene expression in the Arabidopsis thaliana rhizosphere

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns of the plant colonizing bacterium,Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were evaluated as a function of growth in the Arabidopsis thaliana rhizosphere.  Gene expression in rhizosphere grown P. putida cells was compared to gene expression in non-rhizosphere grown cells. Keywords: Gene expression

DESIGN
The experiment contained three biological replicates, two conditions (plus plant, minus plant), and two time points (48 and 120 hours).

PLATFORM
