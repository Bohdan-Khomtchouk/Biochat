TITLE
Role of de novo DNA methyltransferases in hematopoietic stem cells (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the global transcriptome expression in Dnmt3ab dKO HSCs, we performed high-throughput sequencing of Poly A+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from purified HSCs (SP-KSL-CD150+). With biological duplicates, more than 200 million reads in total for each genotype of HSC were obtained.

DESIGN
Mouse hematopoietic stem cell mRNA profiles of Dnmt3ab Dko HSCs, generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
