TITLE
Epigenome analysis of intracranial aneurysm and superficial temporal artery samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA of intracranial aneurysm and matched superficial temporal artery from same patient (n=9) was extracted  with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A total of 500 of genomic DNA was bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and then analyzed on an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of intracranial aneurysm and matched superficial temporal artery from the 9 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
