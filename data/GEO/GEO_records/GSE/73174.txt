TITLE
Transcriptome data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving fingolimod therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Using 150 Affymetrix HTA 2.0 microarrays, we profiled the gene expression of 5 cell populations of the peripheral blood from patients with multiple sclerosis in the course of fingolimod treatment.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series Please note that HTA 2.0 data can be processed according to two different workflows: exon level (GEO platform GPL17585) and gene level (GEO platform GPL17586). This SuperSeries contains each of the 150 CEL files twice, because they had to be submitted for both, the exon level records and the gene level records.

PLATFORM
GPL17585 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [probe set (exon) version] GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
