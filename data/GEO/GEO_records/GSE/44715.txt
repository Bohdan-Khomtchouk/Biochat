TITLE
Mast cell expression data from murine aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) null, AhR_d and normal control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that AhR, a unique chemical sensor, is critical in controlling mast cell differentiation, growth and function in vitro and in vivo. This study seeks to further the understanding of the mechanisms of how AhR control mast cell homeostasis.

DESIGN
Three different batches of bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) from AhR null, AhR_d and normal control mice were cultured in 30% WEHI-3-conditioned medium. BMMCs were purified by negative selection with MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after 4 weeks in culture. 99% BMMCs were FcεRI+ c-kit+ CD49b- by flow cytometry analysis. The cells were further rested in cytokine free medium for 4h. Subsequently, total RNA was collected. Gene expression profiling was performed on total RNA from mast cells using Illumina Sentrix® Murine Ref8_v2_R3 BeadChips. Details of the design and the gene signatures found are given in the paper associated with this GEO Series: Yufeng Zhou, Hui-Ying Tung, Ying-Ming Tsai, Shih-Chang Hsu, Hui-Wen Chang, Hirokazu Kawasaki, Hsiao-Chun Tseng, Beverly Plunkett, Peisong Gao, Chih-Hsin Hung, Becky M.
