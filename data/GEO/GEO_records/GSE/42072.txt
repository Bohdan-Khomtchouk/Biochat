TITLE
Clinical Utility of Circulating MicroRNA Signatures for Breast Cancer Diagnosis (Gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: There is a quest for novel non-invasive diagnostic markers for the detection of breast cancer. The goal of this study is to identify circulating microRNA signatures using a cohort of Asian Chinese breast cancer patients, and to compare microRNA profiles between  tumour and serum samples.  Experimental design: MicroRNAs from paired breast cancer tumours, normal tissue and serum samples derived from 32 patients were comprehensively profiled using microarrays (1300 microRNAs against tumour and normal tissues) or LNA RT-PCR panels (742 microRNAs against serum samples). Serum samples from healthy individuals (n=22) were also employed as normal controls. Significant serum microRNAs, identified by logistic regression, were validated in an independent set of serum samples from patients (n=82) and healthy controls (n=53).  Results: The 20 most significant microRNAs differentially expressed in breast cancer tumours included miR-21, miR-10b, and miR-145, previously shown to be dysregulated in breast cancer. Interestingly, 16 of the 20 most significant microRNAs differentially expressed in serum samples were novel. MiR-1, miR-92a, miR-133a and miR-133b were identified as the most important diagnostic markers, and were successfully validated; receiver operating characteristic curves derived from combinations of these microRNAs exhibited areas under the curves of 0.944-0.946. Only seven microRNAs were overexpressed in both tumours and serum, suggesting that microRNAs may be released into the serum selectively.   Conclusion: The clinical employment of microRNA signatures as a non-invasive diagnostic strategy is promising, but should be further validated for different subtypes of breast cancers.

DESIGN
All tissue samples were histologically confirmed by a pathologist using hematoxylin and eosin staining of cryosectioned specimens. One tumour sample was rejected due to failure to detect any tumour cells. Except for two samples (with 30% and 40% tumour cells), all tumour tissues employed had a minimum of 60% tumour cells, as estimated microscopically. Overall, the breast cancer tumour samples had an average of 71% tumour cells. The criteria for adjacent normal tissue were absence of tumour cells and presence of epithelial cells. Hence, after histological confirmation, 31 breast cancer tumours and 23 matched normal tissues were employed for microRNA extraction and profiling using microarray.
