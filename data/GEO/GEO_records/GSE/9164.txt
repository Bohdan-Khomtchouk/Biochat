TITLE
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Somatic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblast-derived, pluripotent cell lines are described that have normal karyotypes, express high levels of telomerase activity, and express both cell surface markers and genes that characterize human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Keywords: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Somatic Cells
