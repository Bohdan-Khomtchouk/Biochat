TITLE
Lentiviral gene delivery of vMIP-II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We engineered a lentiviral gene vector with vMIP-II, transduced both mature endothelial cells and endothelial cell progenitors, and transplanted these gene-modified cells in Matrigel templates as an in vivo angiogenesis model.  The results are the first demonstration in a cell transplantation setting that vMIP-II is proangiogenic in vivo and can deliver this function by vector-mediated gene delivery to both mature endothelial cells and progenitors. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridisations

DESIGN
5 samples in total, hybridised to Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 GeneChips, comprising 3 HUVEC control samples and 2 HUVEC experimental samples transduced with vMIP-II.
