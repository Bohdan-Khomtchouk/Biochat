TITLE
Lentiviral gene delivery of vMIP-II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We engineered a lentiviral gene vector with vMIP-II, transduced both mature endothelial cells and endothelial cell progenitors, and transplanted these gene-modified cells in Matrigel templates as an in vivo angiogenesis model.  The results are the first demonstration in a cell transplantation setting that vMIP-II is proangiogenic in vivo and can deliver this function by vector-mediated gene delivery to both mature endothelial cells and progenitors.
