SUMMARY
Regulatory Mechanisms of Atrial Remodeling of Mitral Regurgitation Pigs

DESIGN
This study enrolled 6 pigs (age: 18 months) and divided into three groups: mitral regurgitation pigs (MR) (n = 2;  2 males sacrificed 12 months after surgery), MR pigs treated with valsartan (MRV) (n = 2; 2 males age-matched to MR sacrificed 12 months after surgery), and normal control pigs (NC) (n = 2; 2 males age-matched to MR pigs). Valsartan (3.43 mg/kg/day), a type I angiotensin II receptor blocker, was administered from one week before surgery and then daily after surgery in the MRV group. We sought to systemically elucidate critical differences in the alteration of RNA expression pattern between the atrial myocardium of pigs with and without MR, and between the atrial myocardium of MR pigs with and without valsartan using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and functional network enrichment analysis.
