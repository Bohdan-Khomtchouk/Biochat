TITLE
Unveil coffee molecular response mechanisms to drought through the expression of the homeobox-leucine zipper I CAHB12

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Functional characterization of transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing CAHB12 resulted in increased tolerance to drought stress, during distinct developmental stages, and increased tolerance to salt stress during seed germination. An insight into the gene set modulated by the ectopic expression of CAHB12 ectopic expression was provided by parallel sequencing (RNA-Seq) of high molecular weight and small RNA fractions. Classical drought responsive genes were mostly repressed, suggesting that other mechanisms are likely contributing to the tolerant phenotype exhibited by CAHB12-ectopically expressing plants, such as the pathway signaled by heat shock proteins and heat shock transcription factors.

DESIGN
The study includes three samples in total: one wild type Arabidopsis thaliana and two transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the coffee homeobox gene CaHB12. Four RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced: two biological replicates for wild type and two for transgenic plants. Four libraries are also prepared for sRNA-seq from the same plants, but two extra technical replicates were sequenced (one for the wild type and one for the transgenic plants).
