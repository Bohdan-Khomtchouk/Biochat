TITLE
Multicolor miRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization for tumor differential diagnosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled and quantitated miRNAs in two skin tumors (Basal cell carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma) and identified tumor-specific miRNAs. We used these tumor-specific miRNAs to guide development of miRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESIGN
2 barcoded sequencing runs, including 40 unique samples (36 used in manuscript). The details of each sample can be found in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
