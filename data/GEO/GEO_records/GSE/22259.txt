TITLE
BRCA1 depletion effect on HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells following depletion of BRCA1 tumor supressor using RNAi against BRCA1. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying loss of the BRCA1 function.

DESIGN
Six samples (three control samples and three BRCA1 depleted samples) have been analysed. For the control, the samples derived from the HeLa cells treated with RNAi against GFP were used.
