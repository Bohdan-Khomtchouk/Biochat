TITLE
The expression profiles of WT and sgs1△ after tangeretin treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Tangeretin is a member of the polymethoxyflavones in citrus peel, which have been of interest due to their anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. However, their detailed target pathways have not been fully discovered. We applied the notion of chemical-genetic and genetic interactions in budding yeast, screening the putative targeting pathways of tangeretin, and we found that sgs1△ yeast was sensitive to tangeretin treatment. Therefore, we applied this microarray test to investigate the potential pathways influenced by tangeretin in sgs1. The gene expression profiles of WT and sgs1△ mutated yeast under tangeretin treatment were compared.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles of S. cerevisiae WT and sgs1△ strains under 30 μM tangeretin treatment for 4 hours were compared. Triplicated tests were made for each sample (tangeretin-treated WT, control-treated WT, tangeretin-treated sgs1△, control-treated sgs1△).
