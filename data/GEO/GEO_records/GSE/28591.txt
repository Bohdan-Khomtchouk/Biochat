TITLE
Characterization of AGO1-/AGO4-associated smRNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To fully characterize smRNAs associated with AGO1 and AGO4, we developed a two-step protocol to purify AGO/smRNA complexes from flowers, leaves, roots and seedlings with enhanced purity, and sequenced the smRNAs by Illuminaâs technology. We identified some additional miRNAs, collateral miRNAs encoded in known miRNA precursors, phased smRNA clusters and nat-siRNAs. Organ specific sequencing provided digital expression profiles of all obtained smRNAs, especially miRNAs.

DESIGN
We used extracts from Arabidopsis flowers, leaves and roots as well as ten-day old seedlings to purify smRNAs associated with AGO1 and AGO4 protein complexes using a two-step immunoprecipitation method.
