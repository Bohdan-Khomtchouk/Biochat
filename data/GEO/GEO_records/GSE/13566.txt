SUMMARY
Direct contact with mesenchymal stromal impacts on migratory behavior and gene expression profile of CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells during ex-vivo expansion Objective: To investigate the impact of direct contact between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in terms of expansion potential differentiation, migratory capacity and gene expression profile.  Methods: CD133+ purified HSCs were cultured for 7 days on subconfluent MSCs supplemented with growth factor containing medium. After ex-vivo expansion, non-adherent and adherent cells were collected and analyzed separately. Results: The adherent cells were found to have a more immature phenotype compared to the non-adherent fraction. CXCR4 was up regulated in the adherent fraction which was associated with a higher migration capacity towards a SDF-1 gradient. CFU-GM and LTC-IC assays demonstrated a higher clonogenicity and repopulating capacity of the adherent fraction. Genes involved in adhesion, cell cycle control, motility, self-renewal and apoptosis were expressed at a higher level in the adherent fraction.  Conclusion: Adhesion and direct cell-cell contact with a MSC feeder layer supports ex-vivo expansion, migratory potential and stemness of CD133+ HSCs. Keywords: co-culture hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
