TITLE
Global transcriptional profile at a higher fermentation temperature in S.avermitilis NRRL8165

ORGANISM
Streptomyces avermitilis

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of the positive thermoregulation on Jinggangmycin A biosynthesis, the transcriptomes of  S. hygroscopicus 5008 cultivated at 30℃ or 37℃ in liquid medium were compared by microarray analysis. Additionally, the transcriptomes of S. avermitilis NRRL8165 cultivated at the same conditions were analyzed in parallel to filter transcriptional changes common to Streptomyces genus.

DESIGN
Global gene expression in NRRL8165 was measured at 30℃ or 37℃, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL15172 Agilent Streptomyces avermitilis 15K [Agilent-020986]
