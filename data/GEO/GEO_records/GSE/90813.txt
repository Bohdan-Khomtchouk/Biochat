TITLE
Single cell analysis of SFTPC+ cells and CPM-high progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We stepwisely induced SFTPC+ cells from hiPSCs via CPM-high progenitor cells with or without coculturing human fetal lung fibroblasts. Single-cell RNA-seq of CPM-high progenitor and hiPSC-derived SFTPC+ cells demonstrated their differentiation process and cellular heterogeneity.

DESIGN
scRNA-seq: 6 sample. FF-SFTPC_scRNA-seq : 1 sample.
