TITLE
Cultured A549 lung cancer cells treated with actinomycin D and sapphyrin PCI-2050

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to characterize changes in gene expression in response to the anti-cancer agent sapphyrin PCI-2050.  Cultured A549 human lung cancer cells were treated with sapphyrin PCI-2050 or actinomycin D, a known transcripitonal inhibitor.  The gene expression profiles of drug-treated and control A549 cultures were determined using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Further details are provided in our published manuscript: < http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/6/1/9 > . Keywords: responses to treatments with anti-cancer agents

DESIGN
A549 human lung cancer cells (1 x 10^5 cells per T-25 flask in 7 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium) were seeded eight days prior to treatment of non-cycling plateau phase cultures with drug.  At four hours prior to RNA isolation, sapphyrin PCI-2050 (1.25 or 2.5 μM final concentration), actinomycin D (5 μg/mL final concentration), or control (5% mannitol) solution was added to the cultures.  Each experiment was performed in triplicate.  After incubation, all cultures were washed twice with HBSS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and total RNA was isolated and subjected to analysis on Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
