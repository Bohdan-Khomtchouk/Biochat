TITLE
Expression data from primary and secondary CD4 T cell effectors responding towards influenza A virus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How secondary CD4 T cell effectors, derived from resting memory cells, differ from primary cells, derived from naïve precursors, and how such differences impact recall responses to pathogens is unknown. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences between primary and secondary CD4 T cell effectors purified from the spleen, dLN, and lung on day 7 following A/PR8/34 influenza infection.

DESIGN
Congenic naïve or in vivo influenza primed memory HNT TCR trangenic CD4 T cells were sort purifed from the spleens, dLNs, and lungs of infected mice on day 7 post infection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain only CD4 T cell populations that had entered into the immune response by also sorting and collecting only those cells that had divided at least 5 times by CFSE analysis.
