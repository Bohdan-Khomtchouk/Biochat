TITLE
ELAV ChIP-seq in Drosophila melanogaster embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been implicated in a variety of developmental and disease processes, such as stem cell differentiation and cancer. A particularly dramatic form of APA has been documented in the developing nervous system of flies and mammals, whereby a variety of neurogenic genes undergo coordinate extension of their 3’ UTRs. In Drosophila, the RNA-binding protein ELAV inhibits RNA processing at proximal polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites, thereby fostering the formation of 3’ extensions that can reach 12 kb in length. Here, we present evidence that paused Pol II plays an important role in the selective recruitment of ELAV to elongated genes. Replacing native promoters of elongated genes with heterologous promoters blocks normal 3’ extension in the nervous system, while native promoters can induce 3’ extension in ectopic tissues expressing ELAV. Computational analyses suggest that the promoter regions of elongated genes tend to contain paused Pol II and associated cis-regulatory elements such as GAGA. ELAV ChIP-Seq assays indicate pervasive binding to the promoter regions of extended genes. Our study provides the first evidence for a regulatory link between promoter-proximal pausing and APA.

DESIGN
ELAV ChIP-Seq assays were conducted with nuclei obtained from 6-8 hr and 10-12 hr embryos
