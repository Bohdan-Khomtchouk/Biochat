TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile between 58 days-old prognatous sea bass jaws and control ones

ORGANISM
Dicentrarchus labrax

SUMMARY
A sea bass oligo microarray platform was used to profile gene expression in mandibles of 58 days-old sea bass affected by prognathism, a skeletal malformation that strongly affects sea bass production. Two different conditions: i) protruding jaws, and ii) normal jaws were used for gene expression analysis. For each condition, total RNA was extracted from four (4) independent biological replicates, each consisting of pools of five (5) jaws. Statistical analysis with SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarray) identified 333 probes (corresponding to 242 unique transcripts) significantly down-regulated in deformed individuals compared to normal ones.

DESIGN
In this study, we analyzed eight(8) samples, four (4) pools of jaws dissected from normal sea bass and four (4) pools of jaws dissected from individuals affected by prognathism. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Agilent-019810 Dicentrarchus labrax Oligo Microarray platform (8 arrays, no replicate) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal left after all the FE processing steps have been completed is ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.
