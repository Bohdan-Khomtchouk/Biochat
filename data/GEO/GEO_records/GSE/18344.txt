TITLE
The Transcriptome of Nrf2-Deficient Mice in Cigarette Smoke-Induced Emphysematous Changes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cigarette smoke (CS) imposes a strong oxidative burden on exposed tissues resulting in a severely disturbed oxidant/antioxidant balance, which in the context of chronic exposure is assumed to be a key contributor to CS-related diseases. Because of its emerging central role in orchestrating the general cellular antioxidant response, the pathway leading to the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 has received mounting attention over the past decade in investigations aimed at elucidating CS-induced patho-physiological mechanisms. To comprehensively characterize the impact of Nrf2 in acute and sub-chronic smoking scenarios, Nrf2 knock-out mice and their wildtype ICR littermates were exposed to either ambient air (sham exposure) or to one of three doses of CS for up to 5 months with two post-exposure endpoints of 1 and 13 days. The lungs of the mice were monitored for transcriptomic changes on a genome-wide level.

DESIGN
110 samples from 28 different groups are analyzed. For each group there are 4 replicates, besides two groups with only 3 replicates. Group parameteres are: genotype (WT, KN), treatment (sham, smoke), dosage of smoke treatment (low, medium, high), time of smoke treatment (1 day, 2 month, 5 month, 5 month + 1 day recovery, 5 month + 13 days recovery)
