TITLE
Transcriptional profiling comparing S100PBP over-expressing FA6 pancreatic cancer cells to vector-only control FA6 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
S100PBP is significantly down-regulated in pancreatic cancer compared to normal samples. The functional roles of S100PBP are unknown, and therefore, profiling cells over-expressing this gene may lead to further understanding of its functional mechanisms.

DESIGN
We have performed microarray gene expression analysis of FA6 cells over-expressing S100PBP to vector-only control cells to gain clues on the cellular functions of S100PBP.
