TITLE
Suppression of lung cancer development by aspirin and triptolide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation plays important role in lung cancer development. Recently, we found that anti-inflammation drugs aspirin and triptolide when combined showed synergistic effect in suppressing lung cancer development. In this study, we aim to use gene microarray to define the genes and pathways that are affected by aspirin, triptolide individually or in combination.

DESIGN
We will isolate lung tissues from mice of untreated control, aspirin, triptolide, or aspirin/triptolide. Total RNA are isolated and subjected to microarray analysis to define the gene expression profiles. Gene expression data are analyzed by IPA analysis to define the pathways and upstream regulators that are significantly inhibited or stimulated by aspirin, triptolide, or a combination of aspirin and triptolide.
