TITLE
The B cell identity factor Pax5 regulates distinct transcriptional programs in early and late B lymphopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pax5 controls the identity and development of B cells by repressing lineage-inappropriate genes and activating B-cell-specific genes. Here, we used genome-wide approaches to identify Pax5 target genes in pro-B and mature B cells. In these cell types, Pax5 bound to 40% of the cis- regulatory elements defined by mapping Dnase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites, transcription start sites and histone modifications. Although Pax5 bound to 8,000 target genes, it regulated only 4% of them in pro-B and mature B cells by inducing enhancers at activated genes and eliminating DHS sites at repressed genes. Pax5-regulated genes in pro-B cells account for 23% of all expression changes occurring between common lymphoid progenitors and committed pro-B cells, which identifies Pax5 as an important regulator of this developmental transition. Regulated Pax5 target genes minimally overlap in pro-B and mature B cells, which reflects massive expression changes between these cell types. Hence, Pax5 controls B cell identity and function by regulating distinct target genes in early and late B lymphopoiesis.
