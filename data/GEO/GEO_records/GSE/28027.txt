TITLE
Gene Expression analysis of znuA of Moraxella catarrhalis

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gene expression pattern of a znuA mutant constructed in the O35E background.  It's pattern of expression was compared to that of O35E.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were prepared.  Each replicate was grown in BHI broth and RNA extracted with the Ambion Ribopure bacterial kit.
