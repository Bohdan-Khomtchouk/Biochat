TITLE
NTRK3 kinase fusions in melanocytic tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the copy number profiles of clinical samples of diagnostically difficult melanocytic tumors. Of 1202 cases, 22 cases demonstrated relative gain of the 5' portion of NTRK3.  We further performed DNA or RNA sequencing on 12 of these cases and identified ETV6-NTRK3, MYO5A-NTRK3 and MYH9-NTRK3 fusions in the 8 cases in this cohort. Analysis of genomic copy number of melanocytic tumors versus commericial pooled normal control.

DESIGN
Select cases from clinical array comparative genomic hybridization with confirmed NTRK3 fusions.
