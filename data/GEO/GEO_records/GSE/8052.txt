TITLE
Genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Asthma is caused by a combination of poorly understood genetic and environmental factors. We found multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P < 10-12.  In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P = 0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P = 0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P < 10-22) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encode transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma. Keywords: association study, global gene expression, asthma, ORMDL3

DESIGN
Gene expression levels were evaluated in 404 children. We then evaluated the relationship between SNPs in the 17q21 region (which show association to asthma in the same children) with gene expression levels. Definition of abbreviations used in Sample records: ped: an anonymized family id, helps identify related individuals id: an anonymized unique id within each family fatid: an anonymized id for the father of each individual, helps identify siblings motid: an anonymized id for the mother of each individual, helps identify siblings Sex: 1=male, 2=female Country: UK = United Kingdom, D = Germany DDAST: Doctor diagnosed asthma; 0 - unknown, 1 - unaffected, 2 - affected Note: id, fatid and motid may be recycled across families. A zero indicates the parents are not available and the individual has no siblings in the dataset
