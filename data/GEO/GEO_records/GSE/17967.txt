TITLE
RMA expression data for liver samples from subjects with HCV cirrhosis with and without concomitant HCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we used the Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 GeneChip for deriving a multigenic classifier capable of predicting HCV+cirrhosis with vs without concomitant HCC. We studied gene expression in cirrhotic tissues with (N=16) and without (N=47) HCC. Keywords: cross-sectional

DESIGN
Liver tissue samples were obtained from patients waiting for liver transplantation. For each sample, RNA was extracted and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip.
