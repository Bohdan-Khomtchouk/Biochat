TITLE
Gene expression profiling in peripheral blood cells of patients with rheumatoid arthitis in response of anti-TNF-alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of  this study was to characterize the effects of anti-TNF-alpha treatments on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 8 women were submitted to a 12 weeks treatments with Etanercept or Adalimumab. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken before and after the treatment. The samples from the same patients (obtained before and after the 12 weeks of treatment) were compared on the same microarray. Sample taken before the treatment was considered as the control.

DESIGN
Blood mononuclear cells from 8 women suffering from rheumatoid arthritis were used in this study. The samples from the same patients (obtained before and after the 12 weeks of treatment) were compared on the same microarray. Mononuclear cells taken before the treatment was considered as the control.
