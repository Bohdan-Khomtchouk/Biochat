TITLE
S. aureus gene expression following AFN-1252 treatment

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
AFN-1252 is an inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis. Gene expression profiles were generated by microarray analysis of S. aureus cells following treatment with AFN-1252, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis.

DESIGN
Fatty acid biosynthesis in S. aureus was inhibited by AFN-1252 for 15 minutes, and RNA was extracted to look at the gobal gene expression.
