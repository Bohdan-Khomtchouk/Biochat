TITLE
Expression data from wild-type control and Dnmt3a knockout osteoclast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic regulation is a fundamental mechanism mediating various cellular processes. However, epigenetic mechanisms in osteoclastogenesis remain to be elucidated. We performed microarray analysis to investigate gene expression in osteoclasts derived from wild-type and Dnmt3aknockout mice.

DESIGN
In vitro osteoclast culture were performed using wild-type control and Dnmt3a knockout bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells.
