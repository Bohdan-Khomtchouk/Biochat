TITLE
Mechanism and transcriptional program of YB-1 in breast cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YB-1 controls epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by restricting translation of growth-related mRNAs and enabling expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors. We used microarrays to characterize the direct transcriptional and indirect translational regulation of mRNAs by exogenous YB-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Keywords: gene expression profiling

DESIGN
To evaluate this in a genome-wide manner we compared microarray expression profiles of total mRNA and mRNAs isolated from Ps (translationally active) or post-Ps (translationally inactive) fractions of MCF10AT-MSCV vs. MCF10AT-YB-1 cells
