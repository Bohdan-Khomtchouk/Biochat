TITLE
Role of IRF7 in airway epithelial cell responses to human rhinovirus infection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were transfected with siRNA to knockdown IRF7 gene expression, allowed to recover, and then infected with human rhinovirus. At 24 hrs post rhinovirus infection, gene expression patterns were profiled on microarrays.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of five donors, two transfection conditions (all-star negtaive control siRNA; IRF7-specific siRNA), and two culture conditions (medium control, rhinovirus-16).
