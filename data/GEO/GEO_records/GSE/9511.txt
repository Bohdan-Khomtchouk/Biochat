TITLE
Characterization of Plexiform Leiomyomata Provide Further Evidence for Genetic Heterogeneity Underlying Uterine Fibroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plexiform leiomyomata are a histologically defined subgroup of benign uterine smooth muscle tumors based on their epitheliod cytology and abundant extracellular matrix. We used microarrays to compare plexiform leiomyomata to normal myometrium (smooth muscle of the uterine wall), typical leiomyomata, cellular or atypical leiomyomata and malignant leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. Keywords: tumor analysis
