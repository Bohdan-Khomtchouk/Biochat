TITLE
The IRF3 dependent response of macrophages to M. tuberculosis infection

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of macrophages (wild-type and IRF3-/- ) infected with various M.tuberculosis strains (wild-type and ESX-1 mutant)

DESIGN
Comparison of the global gene expression of wild-type BMDM macrophages and IRF3-/- macrophages infected with either wild-type M.tuberculosis or ESX-1 mutant M.tuberculosis, with two biological replicates per group

PLATFORM
