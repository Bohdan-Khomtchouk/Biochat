TITLE
Overlapping and antagonistic genes affected in the sdg8, sdg26 and sdg8 sdg26 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To evaluate the role of SDG8 and SDG26 in genome transcription, we performed transcriptome analyses using 6-day-old seedlings and identified differentially expressed genes in the sdg8, sdg26 and sdg8 sdg26 mutants as compared to wild-type(Col).

DESIGN
Seedlings of wild type control(Col) vs. Mutant sdg8,sdg26 and sdg8 sdg26. Based on two independent experiments obtained each with three independently derived sets of RNA for each genotype.
