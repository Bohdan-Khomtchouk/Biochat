TITLE
[E-MTAB-1310] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch X

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of polyA+ RNAs from eight different human tissues (GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch X) As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification of at least one of their unique splice junctions followed by sequencing. Batch X targets manually annotated transcripts from GENCODE v11 (released Feb 2012) with novel or putative status, non-pseudogene biotype and unique splice junctions not validated previously.
