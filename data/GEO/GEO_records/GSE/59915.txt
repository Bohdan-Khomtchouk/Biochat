TITLE
Anti-SLBP RIPchip data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The animal replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNAs are coordinately regulated with chromosome replication. They are the only known cellular mRNAs that are not polyadenylated.  Instead, the mature transcripts end in at a conserved stem-loop (SL) structure. This SL structure interacts stably with the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which is involved in all aspects of RD-histone mRNA metabolism. We used several genomic methods, including RNA Binding Protein IP followed by microarray analysis (RIP-ChIP) to analyze the RNA binding landscape of SLBP.

DESIGN
Reference based design on two color Agilent DNA microarrays.  Experimental sample is labeled in Ch1 (Cy3), which are mRNA bound by the SLBP RNA-binding protein.  The reference sample is labeled in Ch2 (Cy5) which are the polyribosomal mRNAs from the supernatant that were not bound by anti-SLBP.  Controls included no antibody in the IP (which tends to have non-specific background binding to the beads) and pre-incubation of the SLBP with the antibodies antigenic peptide, which blocks antibody binding to the SLBP.
