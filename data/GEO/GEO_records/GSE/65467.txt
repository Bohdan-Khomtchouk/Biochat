TITLE
DNA methylation profiling in chondrocyte dedifferentiation in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of different passages of human articular chondrocytes treated with 5-azacytidine. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,578 CpGs.Samples included 6 different passages of human articular chondrocytes with 5-azacytidine treatment, 6 different passages without 5-azacytidine treatment,

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
