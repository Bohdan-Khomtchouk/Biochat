TITLE
A Detailed Characterization of the Dysfunctional Immunity and Abnormal Myelopoiesis Induced by Severe Shock and Trauma in the Aged

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The polytrauma (PT) murine model has unique transcriptomic responses 2 hrs, 1 day and 3 days after injury. We determined with this clinically relevant model that the increased morbidity in the elderly is secondary to a failure of bone marrow progenitors, blood neutrophils, and bronchoalveolar lavage cells to initiate and complete an 'emergency myelopoietic' response, engendering myeloid cells that fail to clear secondary infection. In addition, the elderly appear unable to effectively resolve their inflammatory response to severe injury.

DESIGN
We used mouse microarrays to detail the molecular profile of the events that occur following injury in mice models.
