TITLE
Induction of target genes of AP2-Sp in AP2-O::Sp parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Sporozoite-specific genes were induced in parasites that express AP2-O whose AP2 domain was swapped with that of AP2-Sp.

DESIGN
DNA construct encoding AP2 domain of AP2-Sp  was introduced into P. bergei schizonts. It was integrated into the locus of the endogenious AP2-O gene, resulting in swap of the AP2-domain (AP2-O::Sp parasites). Gene expression was analyzed in ookinetes cultured for 20h.
