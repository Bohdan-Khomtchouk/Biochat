TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder with heterogeneous clinical, morphological and genetic characteristics. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are found in 20-30% of patients with CMML. Patients with low risk cytogenetic features (normal karyotype and isolated loss of Y chromosome) account for approximately 80% of CMML patients and often fall into the low risk categories of CMML prognostic scores. SNP-A were performed in 82 CMML patients with low risk karyotypes and uninformative results for conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CC).

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix array was performed for 82 CMML samples at diagnosis or prior to any treatment,
