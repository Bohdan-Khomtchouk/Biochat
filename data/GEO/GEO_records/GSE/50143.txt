TITLE
Expression data of CD9 positive germ cells from young and aged Sprague Dawley germ cell specific GFP rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male fertility and testis function changes with age and so it was sought to determine if these changes are accompanied by changes in gene expression in the spermatogonial cells at the foundation of spermatogenesis A full genome microarray was used to determine if distinct pathways of genes were altered in expression in CD9-positive germ cells with age

DESIGN
Testes from young (4 months) and aged (21 months) Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to dissociation to isolate a singel cell suspension of germ cells. These cells were used to isolate CD9 positive spermatogonial cells. RNA was isolated from these cells for hybridization on agilent miroarrays.
