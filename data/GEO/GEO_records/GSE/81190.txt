TITLE
miRNA expression of lymphoma cell lines with or without HDAC inhibitor treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Various types of HDAC inhibitor are now planned or on going to use against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma including CTCL. However there is a lack of molecular based evidence not only for which HDACi might be effective to use against advanced CTCL but also for which genes might be pivotal target gene(s) of HDACi. To investigate expression changes of miRNAs by HDACis, we conducted miRNA microarray by using CTCL cell lines.

DESIGN
CTCL cell lines (My-La, HH, HUT78) and  CD4+ T-cells of healthy controls were treated with SAHA (5 µM),  panobinostat (80 nM), or DMSO for 24hrs. After treatment, total RNA was extracted from cells, and miRNA microarray analysis was performed.
