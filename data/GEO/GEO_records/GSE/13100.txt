TITLE
Osmotic stress on yeast S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
mRNA amount (RA) and Transcription rate (TR) analysis of W303-1a (wt) and hog1 mutant yeast strains growing in exponential phase in YPD subjected to osmotic stress This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series Transcriptomic and transcription rate analysis by means of GRO of three independent replicates the yeast strain growing in exponential phase. Each time point replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F11-F24). A single DNA genomic hybridization from the same labeling reaction was done on the same microarrays for normalization.
