TITLE
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from Agilent-014850 4x44K human expression array for CRPC Prostate Cancer study with Xenograph data.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated using the mirVana total RNA protocol (part #AM1560, Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA integrity was verified using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (part #G2938A) with nano chips (parts #5067-15101 and #G4411B; Agilent Technologies, Alto, CA). RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Tumor messenger RNA expression was assessed using a human whole-genome oligo TMA kit from Agilent (prod #G4112F) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol and as described previously. In the Characteristics field, we have the notation like " Pt Dxed in 2001; hormone Tx; chemo Tx 2002; HRPC by 2002 " . That means the patient was admitted in 2001, did hormone and chemo treatment in 2002, and HRPC 2002. They are standard prostate cancer treatments.
