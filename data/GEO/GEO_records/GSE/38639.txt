TITLE
Agilent data from Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell tissue and leafs.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify genes of the guard cell transkriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana enriched guard cell samples were compared with total leaf tissue. Genes of the abscisic acid and humidity response of Arabidopsis thaliana guard cells were identified by treatment with ABA-Spray and low humidity. Ost1-2 and slac1-3 mutants were compared to their wildtype.

DESIGN
total samples analysed are 35: 4 biolocigal independent replicates of: total leaf (COL-0) vs. enriched guard cells (COL-0); ABA-sprayed enriched guard cells (gl1-1) vs. control-sprayed enriched guard cells (gl1-1); enriched guard cells (slac1-3) vs. enriched guard cells (gl1-1);guard cells (ost1-2) vs. guard cells (ler);low humidity(20%rh) treated  enriched guard cells (COL-0) vs. high humidity(80%) treated enriched guard cells (COL0)
