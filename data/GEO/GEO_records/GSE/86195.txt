TITLE
MiRNA Expression Profiling in Cisplatin Resistance Human Gastric Cancer Cell Lines and Their Parental Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cisplatin is the first-line agent utilized for the clinical treatment of a wide variety of solid tumors including gastric cancer. However, the intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance is often occurred in patients with gastric cancer and resulted in failure of cisplatin therapy. In order to investigate if miRNA involves in cisplatin resistance of human gastric cancer, we first screened and compared the expression of miRNAs between cisplatin resistant gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901/DDP and BGC-823/DDP and their sensitive parental cells by miRNAs microarray.

DESIGN
Total miRNAs expression was examined in SGC-7901,SGC7901/DDP,BGC-823,BGC-823/DDP four cell lines.
