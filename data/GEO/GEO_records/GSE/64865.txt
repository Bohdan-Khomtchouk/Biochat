TITLE
Expression data from immunophenotypic HSPCs isolated from different stages of human hematopoiesis, in vivo and in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The derivation of functional, transplantable HSCs from an pluripotent stem cells in vitro holds great promise for clinical therapies, but is unachieved. In order to achieve full functionality of HSCs, it is vital to determine the extent to which PSCs can currently be differentiated to the HSC program in vitro and identify the remaining dysregulated genetic pathways. Microarrays were used to compare the transcritomes of ESC-derived immunophenotypic HSPCs to endogenous HSPCs from various stages of development to determine the programs important for human HSC development and function, and which programs were lacking in ESC-derived hematopoietic cells.

DESIGN
CD34+CD38-CD43+CD90+ HSPCs were sorted from human placenta and embryoid bodies, and CD34+CD38-CD45+CD90+ HSPCs sorted from fetal liver and embryoid bodies co-cultured on OP9-M2 stroma, the RNA was extracted, library created and hybridized to the Affymetrix microarray
