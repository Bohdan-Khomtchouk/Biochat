TITLE
Conversion of genomic imprinting by reprogramming and re-differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined whether the changed imprinted genes are maintained or reverted to the parthenogenetic state when the reprogrammed cells are re-differentiated into specialized cell types. To address this question, we re-differentiated miPSCs into neural stem cells (miPS-NSCs) and compared them with biparental female NSCs (fNSCs) and parthenogenetic NSCs (pNSCs) large-scale gene expression analysis of miPS-NSCs, fNSCs, and pNSCs, using the Illumina gene expression array

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the three different NSC samples
