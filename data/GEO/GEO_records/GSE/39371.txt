TITLE
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array data from neuroendocrine primary tumor and its metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reports on common mutations in neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are  rare and clonality of NET metastases has not been investigated in this tumor entity  yet. We selected a NET and a the corresponding lymph node and liver metastases as  well as the derivative cell lines to screen for somatic mutations in the primary NET  and to track the fate of genetic changes (by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 micorarray and targeted resequencing by 454 GS FLX) and during metastasis and in vitro progression. using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryo material or cell lines.  Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 4 samples. 60 samples from HapMap database were used as references for copy number inference.
