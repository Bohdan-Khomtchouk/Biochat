TITLE
Novel targets of microRNA miR-142 in cardiac myocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The nuclear acetyltransferase p300 is a dose-dependent and limiting regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. p300 regulates hypertrophy by controlling the expression of specific microRNAs.The objective of this study was to dissect the role of miR-142 during p300 regulated hypertophic growth in vitro and in vivo and to verify its targets.

DESIGN
MiR142  and a non target control were overexpressed using lentivirus in primary culture of neonatal cardiac myocytes. Overexpression was checked 48 hour post transfection. Samples include miR142 OE and non target from three different experiments.
