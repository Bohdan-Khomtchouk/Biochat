TITLE
RNA-seq data of the Streptomyces venezualae WT and mtrB::apr mutant strains at time point 14 and 20 h (biological duplicates).

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712

SUMMARY
We report here the sequence results of S. venezualae WT and the mutant mtrB::apr strains at 14h and 20h and the differential expression profile of WT vs. Mutant.

DESIGN
WT vs mtrB::apr mutant at 14h and 20h.  Total RNA was isolated and processed by vertis Biotechnologie AG.  Ribodepletion was carried out to remove ribosomal RNA, the sample Tex treated, split in two, 1 half TAP treated the other TAP minus, adaptors were then ligated with the TAP plus sample containing sequence/data enriched for TSS.  EAch was then converted to cDNA and sequenced.  WT vs Mutant was compared at 16h while the others were used for the purposes of TSS identification.

PLATFORM
