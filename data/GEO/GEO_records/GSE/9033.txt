TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids Ia

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Keywords: regulation of gene expression

DESIGN
99 RH cells with biological replicates (198 total) and biological replicates of mouse brain RNA vs. hamster brain RNA and mouse liver RNA vs. hamster liver RNA (4 total)

PLATFORM
GPL891 Agilent-011978 Mouse Microarray G4121A (Feature Number version)
