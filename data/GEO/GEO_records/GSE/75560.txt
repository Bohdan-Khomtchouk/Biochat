TITLE
Expression data from lung tissues of minipig with left lung ischemia-reperfusion

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Lung ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury remains one of the common complications after various cardiopulmonary surgeries. I-R injury represents one potentially maladaptive response of the innate immune system which is featured by an exacerbated sterile inflammatory response triggered by tissue damage. Thus, understanding the key components and processes involved in sterile inflammation during lung I-R injury is critical to alter care and extend survival for patients with acute lung injury.

DESIGN
We constructed a minipig surgical model of transient unilateral left pulmonary artery occlusion without bronchial involvement to create ventilated lung I-R injury. Lung tissues from minipig with sham operation (one sample), left side lung tissues (the operated side)(one sample) and right side lung tissues (the non-operated side)(one sample) from minipig with lung ischemia-reperfusion were submitted for gene expression array analysis.
