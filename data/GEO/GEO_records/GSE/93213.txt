TITLE
809094 Biomarker Identification in Fracture Healing (experiment #3873a mRNA performed Apr 2011)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The specific genes that distinguish normal fracture healing from abnormal healing or nonunion in humans are unknown.  This study was an exploratory investigation of peripheral blood from 2 chronic nonunion patients collected perioperatively (pre/post revision surgery) and at 3 months post revision follow up for comparison to Acutely injured subjects and Healthy volunteer cohorts analyzed separately. We used microarrays to do a global comparison between 2 chronic nonunion patients collected perioperatively (pre/post revision surgery) and at 3 months post revision follow up.

DESIGN
Blood was collected into Paxgene blood RNA tubes pre and post operatively during admission for revision surgery in 2 chronic nonunion patients.  Blood was collected again at 3 months follow up. We explored the data with Partek Genomics suite using all samples at all time points to identify a panel of genes that is differentially expressed across  groups to enable additional biomaker vetting.
