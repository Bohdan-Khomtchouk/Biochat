ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Juvenile gilthead sea bream of 10-15 g initial body weight were randomly distributed in eight 500-L tanks in a seawater re-circulatory system equipped with physical and biological filters, and a heat-unit system that maintained water temperature above 18-19 ºC. Fish grew from July to December at a density of 8-10 kg/m3 with an overall daily growth index of 1.9 ± 0.01. Extruded pellets (47 % protein, 21% lipid; Proaqua, Palencia, Spain) were offered to visual satiety. Feeding was stopped one day before confinement exposure, and batches of 10 fish were then transferred from two 500-L tanks to cylinder net baskets of 10-L volume  (117-123 Kg/m3), suspended each one in 90-L tanks with a high flow of seawater (10 L/min) to avoid water deterioration (Oxygen > 5 ppm; unionised ammonia < 0.02 mg/L). Fish from seven additional 500-L tanks were established as control groups, and remained undisturbed prior to sampling at zero and each sampling time. At each sampling time (1.5, 3, 6, 24, 72 and 120 h), eight fish from one control and one confinement tank were netted into a bucket to be anaesthetized with 0.1 g/L 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MS-222). Fish were killed by cervical section and liver was taken, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC until RNA isolation.  Only 6h, 72h and 120h  were analysed on the microarray. The experimental design was a reference design with the reference being prepared from a pool of all (confined and control) RNAs used in the microarray analysis. All samples were hybridised twice (except L72C5R, L120C2F, L120S4F, L24C4F) with one being the dye swap of the other. Keywords: Time Course
