TITLE
Circular RNA cFUT8 acts as an epithelial–mesenchymal transition trigger in liver cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive cricRNA array, we screened 13617 circRNAs abundant in the human liver cancer and Adjacent normal liver tissues, and the function of differentially expressed circRANs were analyzed by bioinformatics. The results revealed that cFUT8 controls epithelial–mesenchymal transition in liver cancer by cFUT8/miR-548c-3p/FUT8 axis.

DESIGN
In this study, three cases of liver cancer samples were used to acquire the circRNA expression profiling, and qRT-PCR was employed to confirm the results of circRNA microarrays. The functions of the differentially expressed circRNA were analyzed by bioinformatics methods. Finally, through in vivo and ex vivo experiments，the “cFUT8/miR-548c-3p/FUT8 axis” was found to control epithelial–mesenchymal transition in liver cancer
