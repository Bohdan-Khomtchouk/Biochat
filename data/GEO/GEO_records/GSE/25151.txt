TITLE
Gene expression in broiler livers upon supplementation with selenized yeast

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Selenium (Se) is an essential cofactor of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase beside other functions. The evaluation of optimal selenium supplementation in chicken feed and the subsequent effects on animal health and performance requires comprehensive knowledge of the overall metabolic effects of selenium. Therefore the gene expression was measured in the control group with a standard diet and in the group with a Se supplemented diet (0.5mg Se/kg diet) to determine significantly altered gene expression. The selenium was supplemented in the form of selenized yeast (Se-yeast), which mainly consists of organic Se in the form of L-selenomethionine and L-selenocysteine. The control group received a diet, which contained 70μg of Se / kg diet and the Se-yeast group 620μg of Se / kg diet (analyzed).

DESIGN
The one-day old broiler chicks were separated into two groups and received the control or the Se-supplemented diet ad libitum for 35 days. After slaughter the gene expression was determined in the liver of four control and five samples from the Se-yeast group. One sample from the control group did not correspond to the quality requirements and was excluded from the analysis.
