TITLE
Expression data from anti-müllerian hormone treated preantral/small antral mouse ovary follicles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) has an inhibitory effect on ovarian follicle development. However, the mechanism by which AMH regulates folliculogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study we aimed to investigate the changes in transcriptome of preantral to small antral mice follicles after culturing with AMH and thereby identify candidate genes to be involved.

DESIGN
Preantral to small antral follicles were collected from dissected ovaries from six to eight weeks old female C57BL/6Tac mice.   Twelve hour as well as 24 hour experiments were performed in two different concentrations of AMH. The experiments were performed in triplicate. In total 18 samples: 3 x conc. of AMH, 2 x time points, 3 x experiments (triplicate). Samples are comparable within each experiment, that is, sample 1-3 or 4-6 or 7-9 or 10-12 or 13-15 or 16-18.
