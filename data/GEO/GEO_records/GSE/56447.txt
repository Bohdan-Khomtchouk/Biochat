TITLE
Time series expression data during phosphate limitation for E. coli K12 JP6015/pMU91

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
A fermentation strategies with phosphate feeding was applied to elongate transition inti phosphate limitation for an tryptophan overproducing E. coli strain High frequency sampling together with the applied fermentation strategy should provide high resolution insights into regulatory regimes involved in phosphate response

DESIGN
The first sampling timepoint was set as a reference time point after 2,5 h fermentation time to cover phosphate excess conditions. Additional 9 sampling time points were selected based on process dynamics as soon as the phosphate concentrations became sensitive
