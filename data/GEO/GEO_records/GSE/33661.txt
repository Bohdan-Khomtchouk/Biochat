TITLE
Expression analysis of Ralstonia solanacearum strain UW551 at 20°C and 28°C in rich medium (CPG) and in planta

ORGANISM
Ralstonia solanacearum UW551

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, strain UW551 at 20°C and 28°C in culture and in planta. The  temperatel strain UW551 can wilt and cause full-blown disease on tomato plants at 28°C as well as at 20°C.

DESIGN
A 16 array study using total RNA recovered from the following: 8 separate cultures of Ralstonia solanacearum strain UW551 grown in rich medium-CPG (4 grown at 20°C and 4 grown at 28°C) 8 separate in planta samples of Ralstonia solanacearum strain UW551 harvested from diseased tomato plants cv. BonnyBest (4 recovered from plants grown at 20°C and 4 from plants grown at 28°C)  Each array (4-plex format) measures the expression level of 4318 genes from Ralstonia solanacearum strain UW551 with 2 to 6, 40-70 mer probes per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy. The arrays also contain probes for intergenic regions with no technical replicates.
