TITLE
Expression data from activated NK cells [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Natural Killer (NK) cells present natural cytotoxicity against tumor cells, although their activity is increased after activation.NK cell activation depends on a complex intracellular signaling process mediated by activating and inhibitory receptors and the functional outcome depends on the integration of the activating and inhibitory signals received. Soluble cytokines and/or ligands on target cells bind the NK cell receptors, and hence, influence the final NK cell response: attack versus ignorance. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying NK cell activation by IL-2, a MHC-I-deficient target cell (K562)+IL-2 and an EBV-target cell (R69).

DESIGN
PBLs from 4 different donors were activated by 100 U/ml IL-2; K562+IL-2 or R69 cells. After 5 days we obtained RNA and miRNA from naïve NK cells or from NK cells activated with the above mentioned stimuli, with more than 90% of purity. The 16 RNA samples were used to generate cDNA libraries that were hybridized on Human Gene 1.1ST arrays (Affymetrix) and analyzed with the Affymetrix Gene Chip Command Console Software v3.0 (AGCC 3.0, Affymetrix®) and the Expression Console Software v1.1 (Affymetrix®).
