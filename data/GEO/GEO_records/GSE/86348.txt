TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis in human glioma stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be associated with the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells that have different functional characteristics. To investigate Glioblastomas (GBMs) show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be originated by the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells. Notch signaling has been shown to be important for maintenance of GSC population both in vitro and in vivo. A recent study showed that NOTCH -triggered oncogenic activity can be due to not only its ability to regulate coding genes but also long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we investigated the molecular effects of lncRNA in GSC, whose expression is induced by Notch signaling. We searched for downregulated lncRNAs in GSCs by treatment of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Notch1 and JAG1 (si-Notch1 and si-JAG1).

DESIGN
Profiles of gene expression including lncRNA in GSC were generated by RNA-seq.
