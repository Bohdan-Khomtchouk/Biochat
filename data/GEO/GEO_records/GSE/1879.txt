SUMMARY
The wild-type (grown on galactose or glucose) or msn2/4 mutant (grown on galactose) strains were grown aerobically.  At time zero (generation 0) the sparge gas was switched from air to O2-free N2 and samples were harvested after 0 (aerobic control), 0.04, 0.08, 0.19, and 2 generations of anaerobic growth. Keywords: time-course
