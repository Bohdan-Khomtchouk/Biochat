Analysis of the effect of G-alpha or GPCR mutation on the Arabidopsis Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of G-alpha or GPCR mutation on the Arabidopsis Transcriptome Keywords: Comparitive Genome Hybridization

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of wild type and mutants (G-alpha and GPCR) were compared in the current study. The study was carried out on four whole genome oligo arrays. The G-alpha mutant and its corresponding wild type variety were compared on a single array by means of a dual channel experiment (Cy3 and Cy5 labeling). The experiment was repeated on a different array as a flip-dye replicate and the data from both the sets analyzed further.
