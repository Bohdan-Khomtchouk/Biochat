TITLE
Gene copy analysis of the F1 haploid progeny generated by Hypocrea jecorina CBS999.97 sexual development

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genome hybridization. H. jecorina undergoes a heterothallic reproductive cycle, and the mating yields asci with 16 linearly arranged ascospores. Here we have compared whole genome gene copy number in the F1 progeny.

DESIGN
We determined genome-wide gene copy number in the genomes of ascospores generated from diploid wild-type strain
