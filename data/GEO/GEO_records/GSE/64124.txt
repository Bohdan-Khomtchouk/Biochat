TITLE
Expression data from subsets of mouse spleen dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse splenic dendritic cells are divided into different subsets based on their phynotype. CD8α+ and CD8α- dendritic cells play different roles against pathogens. Cross-presentation is essential for immune defense against viruses, tumors and intracellular bacteria and CD8α+ DCs are more potent in cross-presentation compared to CD8α- DCs. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression to analyze the underlying mechanism in CD8α+  dendritic cells cross-presentation

DESIGN
Splenic CD8α+ and CD8α- dendritic cells were sorted by flow-cytometer for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Thirty C57BL/6J mice were sacrified for the splenic cells, splenic DCs were enriched by negtive selection, then CD8α+ and CD8α- dendritic cells were seprated based on CD11c and CD8α markers.
