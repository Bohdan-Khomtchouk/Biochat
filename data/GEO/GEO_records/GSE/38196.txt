TITLE
ATFS-1 mediates a protective transcription program during mitochondrial stress

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
ATFS-1 has been shown to regulate transcription of mitochondrial chaperone genes such as mtHsp70/hsp-6 and hsp-60 in response to mitocondrial stress. To identify the entire ATFS-1-mediated response, we compared the transcript profiles from wild-type and atfs-1(tm4525) worms raised in the absence and presence of mitochondrial stress. We used microarrays to identify genes regulated by ATFS-1 during mitochondrial stress

DESIGN
RNA samples were prepared from wild-type(wt) and atfs-1(tm4525)(mutant) worms fed either control(RNAi) or spg-7(RNAi). Worms were synchronized by bleaching, raised in liquid culture and harvested at the L4 stage. Control is denoted as C and spg-7 treatment is denoted T. Each experiment was performed in triplicate indicated as 1,2 and 3.
