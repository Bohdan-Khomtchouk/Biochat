TITLE
RNA profiling of sclerotinia-infected leaves of Brassica napus reveals cross talk between redox and hormone pathways

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome profiling of suceptible and tolerant lines of Brassica napus infected with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum using a petal inoculation method that mimics field conditions.

DESIGN
A total of 12 samples were sequenced. Three biological replicates of mock- and ascospore-inocluated leaves in both susceptible (Westar) and tolerant (ZY821) genotypes of B. napus. Samples were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq2000 100bp single-end reads at the Genome Québec Innovation Centre in Montréal, Canada
