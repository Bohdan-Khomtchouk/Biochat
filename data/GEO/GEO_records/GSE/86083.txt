TITLE
Polycomb-mediated axial patterning requires nucleosome compaction [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined by RNA-seq gene expression changes in mESCs following the induced expression of WT-, KRA- or DEA-CBX2 variants in Cbx2 null cells.

DESIGN
We generated mRNA profiles from 5 mESC lines (2 WT, 2 KRA, 1 DEA) treated with doxycycline to express similar levels of CBX2, and, from a 6th condition where one of the KRA mESC lines was treated with more doxycycline. Each sample was compared to its own control, which is no doxycycline treatment, to determine the effect of induced CBX2 on gene expression changes. Each sample (with and without doxycycline treatment) was performed with 2 or 3 biological replicates.
