TITLE
Expression data for Tcl1 tg mice compared to CD44ΔB Tcl1 tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tcl1 tg mice develop a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) -like disease. To investigate the contribution of the adhesion molecule CD44 to CLL pathophysiology, we developed a CD19Cre CD44flox/flox Tcl1 tg mouse with a B cell specific CD44 deficiency (CD44ΔB Tcl1 tg). We used the Clariom S mouse microarray from Affymetrix to investigate transcriptional differeneces between Tcl1 tg and CD44ΔB Tcl1 tg mice

DESIGN
CD5+/CD19+ malignant B cells isolated from splenocytes from 4 different Tcl1 tg mice and 4 different CD44ΔB Tcl1 tg were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
