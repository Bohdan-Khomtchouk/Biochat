TITLE
Influence of Erythropoietin on Microvesicles Derived from Mesenchymal Ste cells(MSC) protecting renal function of Chronic Kidney Disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiles of the MSC-MVs and EPO-MVs were analyzed with a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based array of the whole mice genome. Further analysis revealed differences in the miRNAs of 212 EPO-MVs (fold change â‰¥ 1.5 compared to the MSC-MVs), which constituted approximately 22.64% of all of the evaluated mouse miRNAs. Of all of the differences, 70.28% of the changes in the EPO-MV group involved upregulation

DESIGN
To study the differential miRNA expression in MV and EPO-MV which might contributed to the better treatment in chronic kidney disease, we performed miRNA expression profiling of the culture supernatant of MSC with or without EPO incubation using the miRCURY LNA Array (v.18.0) (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark).
