TITLE
3D Expression Data of Myc and Myc phospho-mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to examine the mechanism through which phospho-mutants can contribute to the transformation of MCF10A acini. To investigate this, we examined the RNA abundance of Myc and Myc phospho-mutants (T58A, S71A/S81A, and Myc-4A) against a GFP control.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates of the five samples (Myc, T58A, S71A/S81A, Myc-4A and GFP control) were isolated on day 4 and processed on Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus2 chips.
