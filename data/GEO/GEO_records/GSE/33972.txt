TITLE
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-positive B-cell strain, 28-2: Low v. High latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)-mRFP expression (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of miRNAs in an EBV-positive B-cell strain, 28-2.  28-2 are infected with a derivative of the B-958 strain of EBV, which expresses eGFP constitutively and LMP1 fused to mRFP from its native promoter.  Single cells were sorted by flow cytometry for their levels of LMP1-mRFP (5% expressing the lowest levels of LMP1-mRFP or 5% expressing the highest levels of LMP1-mRFP)

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Low v. High LMP1-mRFP expression.  Biological replicates: 3 Low LMP1-mRFP, 3 High LMP1-mRFP.  Samples were normalized to the expression of miRNAs in a pool of unsorted 28-2 cells.
