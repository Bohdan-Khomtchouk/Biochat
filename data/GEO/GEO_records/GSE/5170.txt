TITLE
TGFbeta- and IMR induced epithelial cell differentiation in a three-dimensional intestinal crypt-villus axis model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The three-dimensional epithelial differentiation model, in which T84 epithelial cells are induced to differentiate either with TGFbeta1 or IMR-90 mesenchymal cell-secreted soluble factors, is previously shown to model differentiation seen in jejunal crypt-villus axis (Halttunen et al. 1996). The gene expression changes were studied in fully undifferentiated and fully differentiated three-dimensional T84 cultures with cDNA microarray method. Keywords: developmental stage
