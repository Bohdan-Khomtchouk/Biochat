TITLE
S. erythraea R5 Fall 2002 RNA Timecourse

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL2338 (wildtype) and K41-135 (overproducer strain from Kosan Biosciences, KOVP) were grown in shake flask cultures in rich medium R5.  RNA samples were harvested for each strain over 5 days.  12 h samples taken for each strain were used as their respective reference ( " time zero " ) samples.  The genomic DNA control compares NRRL2338 gDNA to NRRL2338 12 h RNA to show relative gene expression at the start of the timecourse.  The 12 h RNA control compares initial gene expression between the wildtype and overproducer strains. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Keywords: time_series_design
