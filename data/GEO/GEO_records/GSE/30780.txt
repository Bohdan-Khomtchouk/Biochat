TITLE
Genome-wide analysis distinguishes hyperglycemia regulated epigenetic signatures of primary vascular cells (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that hyperglycemia-mediated induction of genes and pathways associated to endothelial dysfunction occur through modulation of acetylated H3K9/K14 inversely correlated with methyl-CpG content.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9/K14 histone acetylation and DNA methylation in hyperglycemic conditions. see GSE29251 for histone acetylation and DNA methylation

PLATFORM
GPL6884 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip
