TITLE
Strand-oriented RNAseq of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in culture for 48 h in the absence of androgen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to use NGS RNAseq deep-sequencing in order to characterize the complement of polyadenylated mRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in LNCaP, a prostate cancer cell line. RNA-seq data were processed as aggregates of the two biological replicates to increase resulting transcriptome coverage. Trimmed reads were mapped with TopHat v.2.0.12 and Bowtie v.2.2.3, and a custom GTF file to guide transcriptome assembly. This custom GTF file was built by using the human transcriptome annotation GTF file downloaded from Ensembl Project web-site ( http://www.ensembl.org/ ) and modified to include all lncRNAs reported in Cabili et al, Genes & Development 2011.

DESIGN
polyA+ RNA profiles of LNCaP prostate cancer cell line grown in culture for 48 h in the absence of androgen were generated by paired-end deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
