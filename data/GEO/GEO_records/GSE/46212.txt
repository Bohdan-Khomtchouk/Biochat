TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis microarray to screen anti-tuberculosis compounds

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Feature reduction of microarray data from mycobacteria treated with a variety of various clinical and investigational drugs

DESIGN
We are using feature reduction to demonstrate that subsets of biomarker genes representative of the whole genome are sufficient for MOA classification and deconvolution in a medium-throughput microfluidic format ultimately leading to a cost effective and rapid tool for routine antibacterial drug-discovery programs.
