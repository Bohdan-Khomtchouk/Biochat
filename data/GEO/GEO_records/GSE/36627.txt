TITLE
cadmium-mirna-cadmium stress on suspension cells.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-03_cd-mirna - cadmium-mirna - trancriptional and post-transcriptional response to cadmium. - After 5 days of grown in a fresh medium (5% PCV at day0), CdCl2 was added to tested cells (Cad) to a final concentration of 200uM. Nothing was added to control cells (Tem). After 12 and 24 hours of growth +/- cadmium, cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL6403 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.3
