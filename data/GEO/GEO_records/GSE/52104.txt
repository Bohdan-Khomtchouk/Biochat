TITLE
Gene expression profiles of stromal cells in ovarian cancer co-culture models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goal: to profile gene expression change that occur when cancer-associated firboblast precursor cells are co-cultured with normal epithelial cells (IOSE4) or epithelial ovarian cancer cells (HeyA8)

DESIGN
MSCs and INOF cells were co-cultured with IOSE4 cells or Hey.A8 EOC cells. 1000 stromal cells were plated into 6 well plates and 10,000 epithelial cells plated into porous inserts (pore size 1Î¼m, Greiner BioOne). After 24hrs, cells were refed and epithelial cell inserts added to the stromal cell cultures. Cells were grown in 50% INOF medium and 50% MSC medium for 7 days before harvesting RNA
