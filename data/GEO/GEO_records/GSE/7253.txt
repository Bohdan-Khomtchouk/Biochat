TITLE
Puberty and Diabetes in the Kidney

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Puberty unmasks or accelerates nephropathies, including the nephropathy of diabetes mellitus (DM). A number of cellular systems implicated in the kidney disease of DM interweave, forming an interdependent functional web. We performed focused microarray analysis to test the hypothesis that one or more genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) signaling system would be differentially regulated in male rats depending on the age of onset of DM.
