TITLE
A genome-wide loss-of-function screen identifies SLC26A2 as a novel mediator of TRAIL resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify intrinsic mechanismis that mediating Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance , gene expression analysis was performed on MDA-MB-231 cell lines exposed to TRAIL, in parental (Sensitive) or treat to resistance (TTR) conditions.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cell lines, parental and treat to resistance (TTR), treated with TRAIL, in triplicate.
