TITLE
Arsenic-induced changes in gene expression in the neural tube of Folr2-/- KO mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to more thoroughly investigate the mechanism of arsenate-induced NTDs we designed experiment in which highly sensitive Folr2 nullizygous mice were treated i.p. with teratogenic dose of sodium arsenate just at the beginning of the neural tube formation process. This specific knockout mouse and arsenic exposure conditions were chosen as they warranted high incidence of exencephaly in exposed embryos. We investigated the gene expression changes induced by arsenic in the anterior part of neural tube in order to discover patterns that might shed light on the mechanism of arsenicâ€™s teratogenicity. Keywords: toxic response
