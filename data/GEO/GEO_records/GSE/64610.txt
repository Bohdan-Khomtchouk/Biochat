TITLE
Differential gene transcript expression profiles among human monocyte-derived dendritic cells infected with Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain and Leishmania donovani 1S strain parasites at early infection time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) were infected with Leishmania major or Leishmania donovani parasites and collected at 4, 8, and 24 hours post-infection to analyze the differential effects those parasite species have on human host cell gene expression over time.

DESIGN
Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) were generated from blood buffy coats collected from five anonymous healthy human donors and infected 10:1 (parasite to host cell) with Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain or Leishmania donovani 1S strain parasites, where after 4, 8, or 24 hours total RNA was harvested from cells, cDNA generated, and hybridized to human gene transcipt expression arrays to assess differential host cell gene transcriptional expression differences relative to uninfected cells.
