TITLE
Gene expression profiling of preneoplastic Lgr5-creERT2/PIK3CAH1047R mammary subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined the effect of mutant PIK3CAH1047R expression in mammary subsets of preneoplastic mammary glands from Lgr5-creERT2/PIK3CA H1047R mice

DESIGN
Mammary cell subpopulations were isolated from Lgr5-creERT2/PIK3CA H1047R and Lgr5-creERT2 control animals 4 weeks after activation of PIK3CA H1047R transgene expression by Tamoxifen injection. Pooled mammary glands of 2-3 estrus-synchronized mice per genotype were sorted in 3 independent sortings and used for microarray analysis (24 samples in total).
