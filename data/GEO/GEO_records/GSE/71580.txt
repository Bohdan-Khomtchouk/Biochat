TITLE
High Dose Tamoxifen in the Mouse Gastric Epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is widely used in research and clinically in patients. Tamoxifen injection (3 consecutive days, intraperitoneal, 5mg/20g mouse body weight) causes dramatic rearrangement of the gastric mucosa with loss of > 90% of PCs, a 6-fold increase in proliferation in stem/progenitor cells, and morphological changes in the ZCs in the bases of gastric-units.

DESIGN
Time course of injection of high-dose tamoxifen. 3 mice were pooled for each condition.
