TITLE
PD-L1 (CD274) overexpression effect on glioblastoma cell line U251

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to identify genes that were influenced by PD-L1 overexpression in glioblastoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Glioblastoma cell line U251 was stably transfected with PD-L1 or its vector control via lentivirus infection. Three independent 100-mm dished of U251/PD-L1 or U251/Vec were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL20795 HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens)
