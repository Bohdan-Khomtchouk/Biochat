TITLE
Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Budesonide in Human Fetal Lung

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rationale. Lung inflammation in premature infants contributes to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease with long-term sequelae. Pilot studies administering budesonide suspended in surfactant have found reduced BPD without apparent adverse effects as occur with systemic dexamethasone therapy. Objectives. To determine effects of budesonide on differential genes expression in human fetal lung

DESIGN
Methods. We prepared RNA from 3 samples of human fetal lung at 23 weeks gestation before (preculture, PC) and after 4 days culture as explants with (Bud) or without (Way) budesonide (30 nM) and performed RNAseq on the 9 samples.
