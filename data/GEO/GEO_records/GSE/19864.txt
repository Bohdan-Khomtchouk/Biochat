TITLE
Gene expression profiles after RNAi-mediated suppression of RB, p107 or p130 in growing, quiescent or ras-induced senescent IMR90 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The action of RB as a tumor suppressor has been difficult to define, in part, due to the redundancy of the related proteins p107 and p130. By coupling advanced RNAi technology to suppress RB, p107 or p130 with a genome wide analysis of gene expression in growing, quiescent or ras-senescent cells, we identified a unique and specific activity of RB in repressing DNA replication as cells exit the cell cycle into senescence, a tumor suppressive program.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of IMR90 cells before and after RNAi-mediated supppression of RB, p107 or p130 in growing, quiescent or ras-induced senescent conditions. RNA was extracted from growing, low serum (0.1% FBS), confluent, or ras-senescent cells.
