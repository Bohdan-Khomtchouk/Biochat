TITLE
Profiling of novel p53-inducing compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe six novel lead compounds activating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.  Transcriptional profiling indicated that they invoked highly similar responses involving p53 and cell cycle pathways and DNA damage response signaling. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
Six compounds and one vehicle control, with four biological replicates each, for a total of 28 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
