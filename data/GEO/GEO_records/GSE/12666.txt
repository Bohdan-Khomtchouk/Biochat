TITLE
Profiling of novel p53-inducing compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe six novel lead compounds activating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.  Transcriptional profiling indicated that they invoked highly similar responses involving p53 and cell cycle pathways and DNA damage response signaling. Keywords: Stress response
