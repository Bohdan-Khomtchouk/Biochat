TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an important epigenetic regulator that has been implicated in multiple cellular processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deletion or mutation of CTCF is associated with human breast carcinogenesis. However, the exact role that CTCF plays in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. To investigate the biological functions of CTCF in breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms, we carried out microarray analysis comparing the gene expression of CTCF overexpressing and control MDA-MB-231 cells to screen the possible target genes and pathways that CTCF regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA from MDA-MB-231 cell infected with NC-lentivirus (n=3) or CTCF-OE-lentivirus (n=3) was extracted using Trizol reagents. NanoDrop 2000 and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 were used for detecting the RNA quantity and quality. The GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix) was used for microarray processing to determine gene expression profile depending on the manufacturerâ€™s instruction.
