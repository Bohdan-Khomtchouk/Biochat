TITLE
Activation of the IGF1 pathway mediates changes in cellular contractility and motility in single-suture craniosynostosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the effect pg IGF1 actibation on cellular contractility and migration in SSC osteoblast cells. Based on microarray levels of IGF1 expression, we selected fifteen cases and nine controls spanning from the highest IGF1 expression to the lowest in cases and controls. Subsequently, the pattern of IGF1 expressions in these cells was assessed using high throughput RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
RNA-seq based gene expression profiling of fifteen SSC osteoblasts and nine control osteoblasts.
