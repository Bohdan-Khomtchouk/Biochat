TITLE
JQ1 prevents BRD4 recruitment to the lytic origins of replication [Akata-Zta DNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 4

SUMMARY
Lytic infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) poses numerous health risks, such as infectious mononucleosis and lymphoproliferative disorder. We demonstrate that JQ1 and other BET inhibitors block two different steps in the sequential cascade of the EBV life cycle: expression of the immediate-early gene BZLF1 and lytic genome replication. This represents a novel mode of action for antiviral drugs that may increase efficacy and decrease emergence of resistance. The ChIP-seq data below show that the BET proteins bind to both EBV lytic origins of replication.

DESIGN
DNA-seq of viral DNA in latent LGNFR- and reactivated LGNFR+ Akata-ZTA cells pre-treated with acyclovir and either JQ1 or vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL23362 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens; Human gammaherpesvirus 4)
