TITLE
Characterization of small RNA-generating regions targeted by RNA polymerase V in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, heterochromatin is maintained by a small RNA-based gene silencing mechanism known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM requires the non-redundant functions of two plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) Pol IV and Pol V.  Pol IV plays a major role in siRNA biogenesis, while Pol V may recruit DNA methylation machinery to target endogenous loci for silencing. Although small RNA-generating regions which are dependent on both Pol IV and Pol V have been identified previously, the genomic loci targeted Pol V for siRNA accumulation and silencing have not been described extensively. To characterize the Pol V-dependent, heterochromatic siRNA-generating regions in the Arabidopsis genome, we deeply sequenced the small RNA populations of wild-type and Pol V mutant plants. Furthermore, we characterized the siRNA-generating regions which were dependent on RdDM effectors and examined their dependency on Pol V.  Small RNA libraries were generated and deeply sequenced from mutant alleles dms4-1, drd1-1, dms3-1, and rdm1-4, along with their control library (“Wt(T+S)”) which has been described previously (Kanno et al. 2004 Current Biology). More than 2,000 small RNA-generating loci were identified which were greatly suppressed in Pol V mutants.

DESIGN
The Pol V-dependent, heterochromatic siRNA-generating regions were characterized in the Arabidopsis genome by deep sequencing the small RNA populations of wild-type and  Pol V mutant plants. Deep SBS sequencing was used for small RNA profiling of immature inflorescence tissues from RNA polymerase V and RdDM mutants.
