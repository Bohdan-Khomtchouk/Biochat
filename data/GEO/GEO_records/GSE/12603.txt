TITLE
Impaired Cohesin Loading in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Results in a Highly Specific Pattern of Dysregulated Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heterozygous mutations in the cohesin regulator, NIPBL, or cohesin structural components SMC1A, and SMC3, result in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS).  Genome-wide transcription assessment has identified unique profiles of genes dysregulated in CdLS that correlate with different clinical presentations. Cohesin binding analysis demonstrates a preference for intergenic regions suggesting a cis-regulatory function mimicking that of an insulator.  However, the binding sites are enriched within the promoter regions of the dysregulated genes and are significantly decreased in CdLS probands, indicating an alternative role of cohesin as a classic transcription factor.
