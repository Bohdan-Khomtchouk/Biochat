TITLE
Post-transcriptional regulation of circadian rhythm by miRNA in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene regulatory circuit of circadian rhythm has been well studied at the transcriptional level. However, recent published Nascent-sequencing and proteomic data indicates that post-transcriptional mechanisms play essential roles in modulating temporal gene expression for proper circadian function. miRNAs are 19-25 nucleotides long small RNAs now well-known for their regulatory roles in the development and diseases through post-transcriptional and translational controls in a wide range of species.  We systematically analyzed the miRNAs in mouse liver by Agilent microarray. Then by combining our results with the published high-through liver circadian microarray data,  we identified nine mouse liver circadian miRNAs.

DESIGN
ice were housed under a 12-h light/12-h dark regimen with food and water available ad libitum. ZT0 is defined as the time when the lights are turned on. Two mouse livers were collected every four hours in two consecutive days. Then the two samples for each time point were pooled together. The mouse liver RNAs were extracted according Agilent protocol. miRNA microarrays were manufactured by Agilent Technologies, and each contains probes for 670 mouse and miRNAs. Labeling and hybridization of total RNA were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with no modification.
