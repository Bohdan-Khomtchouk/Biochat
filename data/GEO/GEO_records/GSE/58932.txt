TITLE
Expression data form hiPS lines, HEFs fibroblasts and HUES

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of transciptome before and after complete reprogramming of human fibroblasts back to pluripotency We used microarrays to validate complete reprogramming of human fibroblasts and do whole transcriptome comparison of derived iPS versus a human embryonic stem cell line (HUES1)

DESIGN
3 different hiPS lines, the original cell type used for reprogramming (HEFs) and the embryonic cell line HUES1 were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to validate that the expression of hiPS that we generated from reprogramming of fibroblasts are highly similar to a commercial embryonic stem cell line.
