TITLE
Gene expression profile of K562 human leukemia cell line after imatinib treatement

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
K562 cells when grown with erythropeitin do not respond to Imatinib. Here we are comparing the gene expression profile from imatinib resistant and sensitive cells.

DESIGN
K562 cells when grown with erythropeitin do not respond to Imatinib. Here we are comparing the gene expression profile from imatinib reistant and sensitive cells.
