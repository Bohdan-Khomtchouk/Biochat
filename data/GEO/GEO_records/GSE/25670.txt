TITLE
p38 regulated genes in rat myelinating glia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective was to determine the p38-regulated genes in rat primary oligodendrocytes using the p38alpha/beta isoform-selective inhibitor PD169316. The drug concentration used for all experiments was 5 micromolar; controls were treated with vehicle (DMSO)

DESIGN
Oligodendrocyte progenitors were treated for either 1 day or 2 days with PD169316.
