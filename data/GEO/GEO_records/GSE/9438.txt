TITLE
Gene Expression is associated with Progesterone Receptor Status in Meningioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examine gene expression for meningioma cases by hormone receptor status and indicate a stronger association with progesterone than with estrogen receptors Keywords: comparative gene expression

DESIGN
The data are surgical specimens from 31 meningioma patients undergoing neuro-surgical resection at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital from 3/15/2004-5/10/2005. Progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) hormone receptors were measured via immunohistochemistry and compared with gene expression profiling results.
