TITLE
Genome-wide RNA polymerase II recruitment study during the intraerythrocytic life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
We exploited the phosphorylation state of the RNAPII CTD to assess the transcriptional status of most P. falciparum genes across the IDC. We raised highly specific monoclonal antibodies against three forms of the parasite CTD, namely unphosphorylated, Ser5-P and Ser2/5-P, and used these in ChIP-on-chip type experiments to map the genome-wide recruitment and activity of RNAPII.

DESIGN
We raised and used 3 different anti-RNAPII antibodies in ChIP-on-chip analysis to map the position and status of RNAPII across the entire P. falciparum genome over the 48 h of the IDC at 8 h intervals resulting in TP1-6. Total 4 antibodies were used for ChIP-chip analysis for six time points each done in triplicates, except one antibody 8WG16 which was done in duplicate. We also used 8WG16, commercial RNAPII antibody in similar study done in duplicates.
