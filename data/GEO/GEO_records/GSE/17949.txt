TITLE
Integrated cell-to-cell signaling networks regulate vertebrate axis formation and left-right asymmetry

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Target genes of four signaling pathways (Notch, Fgf, Retinoic Acid [RA] and Wnt) are identified in the posterior presomitic mesoderm of 12 somite stage zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from were dissected from wild-type (AB), transgenic or drug treated embryos, RNA is amplified and hybridized to arrays

PLATFORM
GPL1319 [Zebrafish] Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array
