TITLE
Gene expression profile of human bone marrow MSCs in an early osteoinductive stage (e-MSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early osteoinductive bone marrow MSCs (e-MSCs) acquire enhanced hematopoiesis-supportive ability.  We performed microarray analysis on e-MSCs. Cell chemotaxis-assosiated genes were positively enriched and cell adhesion-associated genes were negatively enriched compared with control MSCs. The expression of CXCL12 and VCAM1 extremely decreased.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on human bone marrow MSCs stimulated with osteogenesis-inducing cocktails (OICS) for 2 days (e2-MSCs) or 5 days (e5-MSCs). Human bone marrow MSCs without the treatment were used for control.
