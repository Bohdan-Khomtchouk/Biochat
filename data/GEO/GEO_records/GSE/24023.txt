TITLE
Expression profile analysis of C. elegans intermediate sized non-coding transcriptome

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We detected 32230 transfrags by Tiling array Analysis Software, of which 5866 were transfrags with unknown function (TUF). These TUFs exhibited distinct chromosome location, expression and conservation  patterns.

DESIGN
Six developmental and two conditional stages of C. elegans 70~500nt transcriptome. L1~L4, mature adult (MA), male (ML), dauer (DU), heat shocked (HS). GSM591423_CB2007199-L4-1.CEL is Ce25b_MF, GPL5634 is Ce25b_MR, CEL file is okay using GPL5634's cdf.

PLATFORM
GPL5634 [Ce25b_MR] Affymetrix C. elegans Tiling 1.0R Array
