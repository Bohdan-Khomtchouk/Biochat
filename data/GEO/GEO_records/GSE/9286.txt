TITLE
T47D_MTVL treatment with JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490 with/without R5020

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of the breast cancer cell line T47D-MTVL induced by progestin R5020, in the absense or presence of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway inhibitor AG490. Keywords: Gene expression - T47D-MTVL- hormonal treatment+inhibitors comparison

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of breast cancer cell line T47D-MTVL cell line samples were treated with eiter progestin R5020 or with the drug vehicle Ethanol. One hour before this treatment, samples were treated with the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490. Cell line sample was labeled with Cy5 and hybridized against Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) labeled with Cy3.
