ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can develop from alterations in hippocampal structure and circuit characteristics, and can be modeled in mice by administration of kainic acid (KA). Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to hippocampal functions and has been reported to contribute to the development of TLE. Some of the phenotypical changes include neural stem and precursor cells (NPSC) apoptosis, shortly after their birth, before they produce hippocampal neurons. Here we explored these early phenotypical changes in the DG 3 days after systemic KA administration to mice. Our specific aim was to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying altered apoptosis levels in NSPC following KA-induced status epilepticus (KA-SE). Accordingly, we chose a multi-omics experimental setup and analyzed DG tissue samples using proteomics, transcriptomics and microRNA profiling techniques. We here present a description of how these date were obtained and provide them to others for further analysis and validation. This may help to further identify and characterize molecular mechanisms involved in the alterations induced shortly after KA-SE in the mouse DG.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from dentate gyrus 72h after mice were subjected to repeated low dose kainic acid induced status epilepticus or saline i.p. injections
