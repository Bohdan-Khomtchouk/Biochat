TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of E.coli MG1655 under multiple growth conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Investigation of comprehensive information about the expression level of RNA transcripts across the entire E.coli genome in mulitple growth conditions, including log-phase; stationary phase, heat shock and  nitrogen-limiting condition.

DESIGN
A fourteen chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate culture conditions of E.coli K12 MG1655.  E.coli strains were harvested at mid-exponential phase with exception of stationary phase experiments. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 371,034 oligonucleotide probes spaced 25 bp apart (25-bp overlap between two probes) across the E. coli genome (NimbleGen). Experiments were conducted as three or more biological replicates (different cultures)
