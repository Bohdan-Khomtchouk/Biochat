TITLE
NOD2 transmissible microbiota predispose WT mice to inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Instability in the composition of gut bacterial communities, referred as dysbiosis, has been associated with important human intestinal disorders such as Crohnâ€™s disease and colorectal cancer. Our data showed that Nod2-mediated risk of intestinal inflammation in colitis model is communicable to WT mice by cohousing. Here, we investigated if Nod2-deficient mice microbiota is able to change transcript profiles in Nod2-immunocompetent mice (C57Bl6/J mice) independently of colitis.

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA extracted from colonic mucosa of C57Bl/6J mice co-housed with Nod2-deficient mice and C57Bl/6J mice alone. Direct comparisons of 4 biologicals replicates of C57Bl/6J mice cohoused with Nod2-deficient mice vs C57Bl/6J mice were performed.
