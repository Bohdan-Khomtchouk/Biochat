TITLE
Minimal metabolic pathway structure is consistent with associated macromolecular interactions.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA of three dual perturbation experiments of E. coli K12 MG1655 changing both genetic and environmental conditions. Each dual perturbation experiment consists of four RNA-seq samples (WT, WT+nutrient supplementation, transcription factor KO, transcription factor KO+nutrient supplementation). The three conditions are: 1) adenine supplementation/nac KO, 2) L-tryptophan supplementation/cra KO, 3) anaerobic/mntR KO.

DESIGN
Determination of whether a transcription factor plays a regulatory role in a particular environmental shift by examining differential expression of mRNA levels.
