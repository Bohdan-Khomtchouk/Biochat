TITLE
Genome wide effects of maternal undernutrition

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation profiles of the livers of 1 day old rats from mothers fed with three different diets during gestation. The first animal group was fed with a normal diet (c=control); second group received much less protein than normal and slighlty more carbs (p=low protein, or programmed); third group diet was same as low protein but with extra folic acid (f=low protein+folate). All diets were matched for energy.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from rat livers was subjected to selection according to the methyl-CpG binding domain-based (MBD) protein protocol (DNA pooled from 6 individuals per group) and the resulting fragments sequenced in high throughput. Methylated DNA was captured with MethylCap kit (Diagenode). Approximately 10 ng of captured DNA was used for library preparation (ChIP-seq DNA sample Prep Kit, Illumina).
