TITLE
FIBP maintains colorectal cancer cells stemness via demethylation of stemness genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To validate how FIBP influences stemness, we obtained the genome-wide methylation in HCT116-CSCs by an Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation in 3 cell types (Vector, FIBP_knockdown, FIBP/GSK3b_knockdown)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
