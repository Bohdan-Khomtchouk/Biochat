TITLE
Gene expression changes in Tulasnella calospora- Serapias vomeracea mycorrhizal protocorms compared to Tulasnella calospora free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Tulasnella calospora

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Tulasnella calospora mycorrhizal protocorms compared to free-living mycelium . Protocorms and control mycelium were harvested after 30 days and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Tulasnella calospora  transcripts ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Tulca1 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Tulasnella calospora mycorrhizal protocorms and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.

PLATFORM
