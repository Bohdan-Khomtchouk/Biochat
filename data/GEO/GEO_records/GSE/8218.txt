TITLE
Gene expression data from prostate cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer gene expression profiles were studied in this project. A total RNA from 148 prostate sample with various amount of different cell types were hybridized to Affymetrix U133A arrays. The percentage of different cell types vary considerably among samples and were determined by pathologist. Cell type specific genes can be determined by linear regression using the methods of Stuart et al, PNAS, 2004. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
148 prostate samples, with various amounts of tumor, stroma, BPH and atrophic gland, were used for this study.
