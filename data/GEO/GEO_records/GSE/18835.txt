TITLE
mRNA abundance in HEK293T cells mock or miR-124 transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293T cells were either mock or miR-124 transfected. Cells were lysed 12 hours after transfection with Trizol reagent. RNA was isolated, amplified, labeled (cy5), and comparatively hybridized with a universal reference (cy3) on HEEBO arrays in biological triplicate. In addition, each biological replicate was measured twice (#2's). Data from the technical replicates was averaged before analysis. SS=steady state Compound Based Treatment: miR-124

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
