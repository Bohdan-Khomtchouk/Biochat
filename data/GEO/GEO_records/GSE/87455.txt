TITLE
Assessment of tumor pathological and transcriptional biomarkers in pre- and on-treatment core biopsies predictive of response and outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assessment of tumor pathological and transcriptional biomarkers in pre- and on-treatment core biopsies predictive of response and outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer: Results from a multi-center, single-arm, phase 2 study (the PROMIX trial) Global gene expression profiling was performed on samples from 3 time points (baseline, after 2 cycles and  surgery) from women with breast cancer receivcing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with bevacizumab in a phase 2 trial

DESIGN
Multi-center, single-arm, phase 2 study of neoadjuvant anthracycline (epirubicin) plus taxane (docetaxel) with the addition of bevacizumab (avastin) for women with large operable and locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer.
