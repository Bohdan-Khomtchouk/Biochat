TITLE
Gene expression profile of cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from human foreskin and lung fibroblasts, and human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cardiomyocyte-like cells can be reprogrammed from somatic fibroblasts by combinations of genes, providing a new avenue for cardiac regenerative therapy. Here we show that functional cardiomyocytes can be rapidly and efficiently generated from human fibroblasts by specific combination small molecules. Microarray analysis has been used to compare the expression profile of cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from human foreskin and lung fibroblasts, and human ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
Cardiomyocytes generated from different origins were metabolically purified under glucose-depleted and lactate-abundant conditions for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
