TITLE
C9orf72 is required for proper macrophage and microglial function in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Decreased expression of C9orf72 is seen in expansion carriers, suggesting loss of function may play a role in disease. We find that two independent mouse lines lacking the C9orf72 ortholog (3110043O21Rik) in all tissues developed normally and aged without motor neuron disease. Instead, C9orf72 null mice developed progressive splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with accumulation of engorged macrophage-like cells. C9orf72 expression was highest in myeloid cells, and loss of C9orf72 led to lysosomal accumulation and altered immune responses in macrophages and microglia, with age-related neuroinflammation similar to C9orf72 ALS but not sporadic ALS patient tissue. Thus, C9orf72 is required for normal function of myeloid cells, and altered microglial function may contribute to neurodegeneration in C9orf72 expansion carriers.

DESIGN
To compare the RNA Seq profiles from the lumbar region of spinal cords from mice  lacking one copy or both copies of the C9orf72 ortholog (3110043O21Rik) compared to wild type control with two copies at 3 months (n=3) and 17 months (n=4).
