TITLE
Differential transcript stability measurements in MDA-MB-231 vs. MDA-LM2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed whole-genome stability measurements for MDA-MB-231 and its highly metastatic derivative MDA-LM2. Our goal was to identify post-transcriptonal regulons that are deregulated en route to higher metastatic capacity.

DESIGN
Cells were pulsed with 4-thiouridine for 2 hours and then RNA was extracted at 0, 2, 4, and 7 hr time-points in quadruplicate from each cell line. 4sU labeling followed by RNA-seq was then used to measure the abundance of transcripts in each population. A decay rate was estimated based on the rate at which transcript abundance was reduced at these time-points.
