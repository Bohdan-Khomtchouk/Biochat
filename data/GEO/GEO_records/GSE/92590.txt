TITLE
Simultaneous transcriptional and epigenomic profiling from specific cell types within heterogeneous tissues in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study introduces “NuTRAP”, a transgenic mouse that allows simultaneous isolation of cell type-specific translating mRNA and chromatin from complex tissues Using NuTRAP, we successfully characterize gene expression and epigenomic states of various adipocyte populations in vivo, To demonstrate general usefulness, we chateraterize histone states of in vivo hepatocytes.

DESIGN
We demonstrate the robustness of NuTRAP-based ChIP-seq by performing titration experiments
