TITLE
Single Cell RNA-sequencing of Pancreatic Circulating Tumor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are shed from primary tumors into the bloodstream, mediating the hematogenous spread of cancer to distant organs. Using a pancreatic cancer mouse model, we applied a microfluidic device to isolate CTCs independently of tumor epitopes, subjecting these to single cell RNA-sequencing. This study was conducted to determine the heterogeneity of pancreatic CTCs and to compare these CTCs to matched primary tumors, cell line controls (NB508 cancer cell line and MEF non-cancer cell line), primary tumor single cells, and normal leukocytes/WBCs.

DESIGN
We profiled RNA from 75 single cells circulating in mouse blood enriched for circulating tumor cells from 5 mice, 12 single cells from a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, 16 single cells from the nb508 mouse pancreatic cancer cell line, 12 single mouse white blood cells, 18 single GFP lineage-traced circulating tumor cells from two mice, 20 single GFP lineage-traced cancer cells from the primary pancreatic tumor of a mouse, and 34 dilutions to 10 or 100 picograms of total RNA from mouse primary pancreatic tumors from 4 mice.
