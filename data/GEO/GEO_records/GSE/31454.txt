TITLE
Species-specific splicing differences are primarily governed by changes in  cis-acting sequences

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed whether human transcripts expressed in an aneuploid mouse that carries human chromosome 21 (HsChr21) are spliced in a human-specific or mouse-specific fashion. In almost all cases, human-specific alternative splicing is maintained in the mouse nucleus. Species-specific splicing therefore appears to be primarily directed by cis-acting elements, rather than changes in the levels or activities of trans-acting factors.
