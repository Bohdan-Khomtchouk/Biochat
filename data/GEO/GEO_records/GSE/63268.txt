TITLE
Effects of narciclasine treatment on major metabolic organs of C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To test the effects of narciclasine treatment on major metabolic organs of C57BL/6 mice, we first fed the mice with a high fat diet (HFD) then gavaged them with the narciclasine weekly. After 7 weeks of narciclasine treatment, the four major metabolic organs WAT, BAT, Liver and muscle were harvested and the total RNA was prepared for RNA sequencing analysis. By analyzing the RNA-seq data sets, we found that the primary target of this narciclasine is skeletal muscle.
