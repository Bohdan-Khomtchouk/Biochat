TITLE
Expression data from renal cysts of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular pathways that modulate renal cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
We performed global gene profiling on renal cysts of different size (small cysts: less than 1 ml, n=5; medium cysts: between 10-25 ml, n=5; large cysts: greater than 50 ml, n=3) and minimally cystic tissue (MCT, n=5) from five PKD1 polycystic kidneys. Additionally, non-cancerous renal cortical tissue from three nephrectomized kidneys with isolated renal cell carcinoma was used as normal control tissue (n=3)
