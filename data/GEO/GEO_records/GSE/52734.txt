TITLE
Gene expression analysis of high-glucose stimulated human mesangial cells and tubular epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling in mesangial cells and tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which were stimulated by high glucose (HG) and detected the expression of inflammation associated genes. HG increased the mRNA expression of oxidative stress, inflammasome and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) related genes in mesangial cells. Pro-inflammatory/Th1 gene expression was upregulated, but Th2 related gene expression was downregulated in mesangial cells. In TECs, HG stimulation increased pro-inflammatory/Th1/Th2 gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of human mesangial cells and tubular epithelial cells, which were stimuated HG for 24 hours or mannitol contorol.
