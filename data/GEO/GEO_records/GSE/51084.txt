TITLE
Expression data from WT and Eed KO neonatal mouse LT-HSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies point to a pivotal role of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in stem cell function and cancer. Loss of function approaches targeting individual PRC2 subunits have however generated findings that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we prevent assembly of both Ezh1- and Ezh2-containing PRC2 complexes by conditional deletion of Eed, a core subunit, and assess glodbal gene expression changs in LT-HSCs.

DESIGN
LT-HSC (long-term hematopoietic stem cells) were sorted from bone marrow of  9-day old wild type (Lin-Sca1+Kit+CD48-CD150+) or Eed KO animals (Lin-Sca1+CD48-CD150+). Each sample was double or triple sorted to ensure high purify.
