TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to physical plasma treatment

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
In this study, we introduce for the first time a growth chamber system suitable for physical plasma treatment of bacteria in liquid medium. Bacillus subtilis 168 cells were treated with argon plasma in order to investigate their specific stress response usong a proteomic and transcriptomic approach. The treatment with three different discharge voltages revealed not only growth differences, but also clear cellular stress responses. B. subtilis faces severe cell wall stress, which was made visible alsoelectron microscopy, DNA damages and oxidative stress. The biological findings could be supported by the reactive plasma species, found by plasma diagnostics, i.e. optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
