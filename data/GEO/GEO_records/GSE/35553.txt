TITLE
Penetrance of biallelic SMARCAL1 mutations is associated with environmental and genetic disturbances of gene expression (3)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant autosomal recessive disorder. Using human, Drosophila, and mouse models, we show that the proteins encoded by SMARCAL1 orthologues localize to transcriptionally active chromatin and modulate gene expression. We also show that similar to SIOD patients, deficiency of the SMARCAL1 orthologues alone is insufficient to cause disease in fruit flies and mice although such deficiency causes modest diffuse alterations in gene expression. Rather, disease manifests when SMARCAL1 deficiency interacts with genetic and environmental factors that further alter gene expression. We conclude that the SMARCAL1 annealing helicase buffers fluctuations in gene expression and that alterations in gene expression contribute to the penetrance of SIOD.

DESIGN
The RNA sequencing libraries were constructed from the liver RNA of 3-4-month Smarcal1del/del and wt female mice (n=3/group) at 20°C and after 1 hour at 39.5°C. These libraries were sequenced using the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing procedure.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
