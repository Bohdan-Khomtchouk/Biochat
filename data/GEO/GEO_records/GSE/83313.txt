TITLE
Expression data from human HMGN4- and HMGN2-expressing mouse embryionic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HMGN proteins, a family of non-histone nucleosome-binding proteins, maintain a dynamic balance between more and less compacted fibers via interactions with other architectural elements of chromatin. This balance affects the ability of regulatory factors to access their target sites, which eventually modifies the expression profile of the cell. We used microarrays to detail  gene expression change in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing human HMGN4  to identify outlier genes and distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), MEFs, expressing hHMGN4 (MEF-N4)  or hHMGN2 (MEF-N2) or vector alone (MEF-V, served as a control) were harvested from exponentially grown cell culture  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
