TITLE
Tead2 expression levels control the subcellular distribution of Yap and Taz, zyxin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (expression)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cellular changes during an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) largely rely on global changes in gene expression orchestrated by transcription factors. Tead transcription factors and their co-factors Yap and Taz have been shown to be implicated in EMT, nevertheless, their direct and indirect target genes during EMT have remained elusive. We used microarrays to detail the changes in global programme of gene expression during TGFβ-induced EMT in a murine breast cancer cell line (Py2T).

DESIGN
We compared expression profiles of treated Py2T breast cancer cell lines (5 days of TGFβ treatment 2ng/ml) to profiles of untreated cells, we used 2 biological replicates for each condition.
