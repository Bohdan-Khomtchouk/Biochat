TITLE
Host Factors with Reduced Expression in Two HCV Permissive Cell Lines as Compared to the Non-Permissive Parent Cell Line Huh7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Drugs directly targeting Hepatitis C (HCV) are often rendered useless by the high mutation rate of the virus. Thus, we deduce that targeting of host factor that affect HCV replication may provide enhanced therapy fort HCV infection. Hepatocyte cell line Huh7 is known to be non-permissive for Hepatits C (HCV) replication.  Through a method developed by the Rice laboratory (Blight, K.J.,  et al., J Virol, 2002), selection of a small subset of permissive hepatocytes is possible. The Rice laboratory generated the first permissive cell line, Huh7.5, using this method. We generated another permissive cell line, HRP1, using the same method. With microarray, we compared the expression of host mRNAs in non-permissive Huh7 to both Huh7.5 and HRP1 searching for host factors lost in the cell lines permisive for HCV replication.

DESIGN
Non-permissive cell line Huh7 and permissive cell lines Huh7.5 and HRP1 were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
