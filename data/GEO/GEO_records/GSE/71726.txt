TITLE
Whole rye consumption improves blood and liver n-3 fatty acid profile and gut microbiota composition in rats

ORGANISM
human gut metagenome

SUMMARY
This study in rats was designed to investigate whether whole rhye (WR) can influence the metabolism of n-3 and n-6 long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and gut microbiota composition. For 12 weeks, rats were fed a diet containing either 50% WR or 50% refined rye (RR). Total bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal and cecal samples (n=5 per group). 16S PCR amplification was performed to assess the microbial diversity at the family level using the HuGChip. Amplified DNA was purified and labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dye and hybridized on the microarray.
