TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of endometriotic stromal cells treated with hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In ovarian endometrioma, much iron, which is derived from blood in cyst, deposit in stroma. This iron generates oxidative stress by Fenton reaction, which is supposed to affect endometriotic stromal cells. We used gene expression microarrays to find influence of oxidative stress on endometriotic stromal cells. Gene expression microarrays revealed no statistically differences caused by oxidative stress.

DESIGN
9 samples, which were 3 immortalized eutopic endometrial cells from patients without endometriosis, 3 immoralized eutopic endometrial cells from patients with ovarian endometrioma and 3 immortalized endometriotic stromal cells from patients with ovarian endometrioma, were treated with 1uM hydrogen peroxide for 60 hours and 9 controls untreated with hydrogen peroxide were prepared.  A total of 18 microarrays were used for 9 samples treated with hydrogen peroxide and 9 controls.
