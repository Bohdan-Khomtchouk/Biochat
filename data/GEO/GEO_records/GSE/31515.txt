TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of endometriotic stromal cells treated with hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In ovarian endometrioma, much iron, which is derived from blood in cyst, deposit in stroma. This iron generates oxidative stress by Fenton reaction, which is supposed to affect endometriotic stromal cells. We used gene expression microarrays to find influence of oxidative stress on endometriotic stromal cells. Gene expression microarrays revealed no statistically differences caused by oxidative stress.
