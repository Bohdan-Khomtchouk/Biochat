TITLE
Gene expression analysis of ambient or 10.5% oxygen exposed rat gestation d13.5 metrial gland tissues. The animals were exposed to low oxygen from gestation day 6.5 to 13.5.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptomic profile of metrial gland tissue in ambient (21% oxygen) and hypoxic (10.5% oxygen) conditions.

DESIGN
3 replicates of rat metrial gland tissue in ambient (21% oxygen) conditions and 3 replicates of rat metrial gland tissues in hypoxic (10.5% oxygen) conditions. Pregnant animals were exposed to 10.5% oxygen tensions from gestation day 6.5 to 13.5. Animals were sacrificed and metrial gland tissues were collected.
