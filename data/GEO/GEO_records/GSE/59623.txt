TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of MEF cell transcriptome after Salmonella Typhimurium infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We infected Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast and cultured them in anchorage independent conditions to study tranformation induced by the bacterium. We cultured these transformed cells multiple rounds in the presence of Ciprofloxacin to remove intracellular Salmonella after transformation occured. By doing RNA sequencing we indentified genes of which expression was altered upon infection. This helps us to understand how Salmonella alters the host cell, resulting in transformation

DESIGN
We Cultered two biological duplicates of infected MEF cells, which we compared to a non transformed MEF control sample

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
