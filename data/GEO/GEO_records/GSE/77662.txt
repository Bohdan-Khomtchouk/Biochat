TITLE
SNP data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells from Parkinson's Disease patients harbouring G2019S mutations in the LRRK2 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) using Retroviral virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation and downstream assays. Gene expression profiling in patient-derived dopamine neurons identifies candidate therapeutic molecules in Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from 3 PD LRRK2 G2019S patients and 3 control donors. SNP and gene expression datasets were generated from patient and control lines. Note that iPS OX1-19 and iPS-NHDF-1, also used in the current study, have been published previously so datasets are not given here [GSE45472 PMID:23951090 ;  GSE43904 PMID:24586273]
