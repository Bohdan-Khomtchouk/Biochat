TITLE
LIM-Domain-Binding 1 maintains the terminally-differentiated state of pancreatic β-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Utilize high-throughput transcriptomic and cistromic analysis to determine the functional requirement for LDB1 and ISL1 in mature murine pancreatic β-cells while simultaneously assessing their functional interdependence at the chromatin level.

DESIGN
The total RNA profiles for FACS-enriched populations of WT, Ldb1-negative, and Isl1-negative β-cells isolated from tamoxifen-induced male mice at post-natal day (P) 56, P56, and P49, respectively, were generated by RNA-seq. The LDB1 and ISL1 whole pancreatic islet cistromes from 8-10-week-old male CD1 mice were generated by ChIP-seq.

PLATFORM
