TITLE
Genomic hybridization of several Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotypes' reference strains compared to strain JL03

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
To make clear the genetic diversity and virulence evolution at the genome-wide level of A. pleuropneumoniae Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Gene content in various Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains compared to A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (GenBank Accession number: CP000687). Strains have been compared to the JL03 strain by comparative genomic hybridization using genome-wide 60-mer oligonucleotides microarrays representing the JL03 genome. Genes have been deemed present or divergent in the various strains.
