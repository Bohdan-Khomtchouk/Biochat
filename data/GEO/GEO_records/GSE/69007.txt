TITLE
Dnmt3l-knockout donor cells improve somatic cell nuclear transfer reprogramming efficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that Dnmt3l-KO donor cells display decreased levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 accumulation, higher level of active histone mark H3K27ac and increased cytoplasmic localization of HDAC1, implicating a permissive epigenetic state beneficial for nuclear reprogramming.

DESIGN
To investigate the gene expression profiles of MEFs and to find out the potential genes responsible for the improvement of Dnmt3l-KO cloned embryos.
