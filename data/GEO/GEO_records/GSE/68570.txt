TITLE
Transportome profiling identifies profound alterations in Crohnâ€™s disease partially restored by commensal bacteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, the transcriptional analysis of CD biopsies reveals profound alterations in the ileum transportome profile. More than 60 SLC transporters showed different expression pattern compared with the healthy donors, being mostly decreased. Changes were confirmed in almost all the eighteen altered SLCs analyzed by RT-PCR. The results obtained display alterations in amino acid transporters, purinome members, Zn transporters and metallothioneins. All together, these alterations which mainly involve transporters localized at the apical membrane of the enterocyte anticipate impaired amino acid uptake and purinergic responses. Remarkably, incubation of explants with specific commensal bacteria restored almost all CD transportome alterations.

DESIGN
Genome wide transcriptomic profile of Ileal mucosa from five healthy and six Chron's disease samples .
