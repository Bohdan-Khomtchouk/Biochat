TITLE
Slr0643, a S2P Homolog, Is Essential for Acid Acclimation in Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
Every cyanobacterial species contains gene encoding site-2-protease (S2P) homolog. The studied prokaryotic S2P homologs play essential roles in regulating stress response through intramembrane proteolysis of membrane-bound anti-sigma factors. Here, gene of Slr0643, one of four S2P homologs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was insertionally disrupted to explore its physiological role. Only a partially segregated mutant was obtained, indicating its indispensability for growth. The partially disrupted mutant could not grow at pH 6.5, while wild type acclimated to pH 6.5 quickly. The slr0643 gene expression was transiently induced after pH transfer from 7.5 to 6.5. Both evidences demonstrated the pivotal role of fully functional Slr0643 in acid acclimation. DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses decoded genes involved in early acid acclimation and revealed differentially expressed genes due to slr0643 disruption at both pH conditions. Early acid acclimation to pH 6.5 included upregulation of sigH, hik16 and hik35, and downregulation of pcrR and sigG; as well as downregulation of porins and upregulation of inorganic carbon and nitrogen transporters. Defective photosynthesis and excess expression of NADH dehydrogenase, together with over upregulation of carbon transporter and repression of nitrogen transporter and metabolism gene contributed to the acid lethality of mutant at pH 6.5. Most interestingly, analysis of microarray data revealed the close relationship between slr0643 disruption and expression of sigH operon. Therefore it was implied that Slr0643/Sll0857/SigH might acts through S2P/anti-Sigma factor/Sigma factor mechanism to play a role in acid acclimation. â€ƒ

DESIGN
Loop design was used to compare differential expression of wild type and mutant at pH 7.5 and pH 6.5 respectively, including dye-swape. Biological variation was sampled by extracting RNA from three independent experiments and pooling them together before hybridizations. Two or four replicate chips for each comparison and two replicate printings per chip represent technical repeats.
