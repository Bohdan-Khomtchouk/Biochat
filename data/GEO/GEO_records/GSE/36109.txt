TITLE
Reproducibility of global gene expression in rat lung

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess the reproducibility of global gene expression in rat lung from experiments performated by 2 individuals. Expression analyses in 01matsu and 01suzu rat lung. Both prepared under the same conditions, and the comparison is between the reproducibility of the experiment as performed by two different individuals.

DESIGN
Affymetrix® GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array was used to analyze total RNA from rat lung.

PLATFORM
GPL1355 [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
