TITLE
Gene expression signature associated with BRAFV600E mutation in human papillary thyroid carcinoma based on transgenic mouse model (human)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRAFV600E mutation is the most frequent molecular event in papillary thyroid carcinoma. The relation of this genetic alteration with the factors od poor prognosis has been reported as well as its influence on PTC gene signature. However human material disables distinction of cancer causes from its effect. We used our transgenic mouse model of papillary thyroid carcinoma induced by the BRAFV600E mutation to select BRAFV600E-specifi gene signature which was than compared to human material

DESIGN
The human microarray data were obtained for: 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas including 18 BRAF(+), 8 RET(+), 1 RAS(+); 18 apparently healthy thyroids. In order to find BRAFV600E-specific gene signature data obtained from our transgenic mouse model of PTC were compared to human material. The analyses were performed taking into account not only the BRAF mutation but also other PTC initiating events including RET rearrangements and RAS poin mutations. Morover the microarray data were validated with the QPCR reaction.
