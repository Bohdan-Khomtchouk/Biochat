TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of miRNAs expression in chciken ALV-J-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and uninfected control.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to investigate the differentially expressed miRNAs between ALV-J-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and uninfected control by Illumina deep sequencing. Methods:Total RNA from two ALV-J-infected MDM (designated: J3h_1, J3h_2, J36h_1 and J36h_2) and two uninfected MDM samples (designated:  NC3h_1, NC3h_2, NC36h_1 and NC36h_2) was isolated by TRIzol following the manufacturer’s instruction at 3 h post infection (hpi) and 36 hpi. RNA samples of two individuals within each group were pooled with equal amounts, and then were subjected to Illumina deep sequencing by Illumina Hiseq 2000. Results:  compared to the uninfected MDM, we identified 13 significant up-regulated miRNAs and 2 significant down-regulated miRNAs in ALV-J infected MDM at 3 hpi, and 6 significant up-regulated miRNAs and 2 significant down-regulated miRNAs in ALV-J infected MDM at 36 hpi. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DE miRNAs involved in the immune response induced by ALV-J infection in MDM at 3 hpi. In addition, only 25 miRNAs-target DEGs were identified in MDM with ALV-J infection at 36 hpi, and these target DEGs can’t be significantly enriched in any GO terms and KEGG pathway..

DESIGN
Chicken miRNAs profiles of ALV-J infected MDM and uninfected MDM were generated by deep sequencing, using  Illumina Hiseq 2000..
