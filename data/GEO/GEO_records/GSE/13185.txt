TITLE
Role of the Pho2p transcription factor in the transcriptional response associated to AICAR and SAICAR accumulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of Pho2p in the transcriptional response associated to AICAR and SAICAR accumulation. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined to measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC. Keywords: Comparative genomic transcription analysis on total RNA from cells accumulating AICAR and SAICAR in a pho2 deletion context.
