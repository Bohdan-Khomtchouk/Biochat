TITLE
Affymetrix CytoScan HD array data for del(17p) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed whole genome profiling in order to determine the landscape of genetic alterations assoicated with a subset of CLL that is characterized by deletions in 17p The number of copy number alterations predicted shorter time to treatment among patients untreated at sampling. Chromosome 3p, 4p, and 9p were frequently deleted in del(17p) CLL and strongly associated with shorter OS. We conclude that del(17p) has a unique genomic profile characterized typically by TP53 mutation with novel CNAs and novel drivers, with increasing genomic complexity of any type associated with worse overall survival.

DESIGN
Affymetrix CytoScan array analysis was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples (tumor) and saliva (normal) in order to determine genome-wide copy number alterations. Tumor DNA of 40 CLL patients with 17p deletion were included in the analysis along with DNA from one patient that did not harbor del(17p), but had a copy neutral LOH in 17p.
