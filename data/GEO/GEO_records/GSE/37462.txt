TITLE
Thermotoga maritima transcriptome analysis under multiple growth conditions [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima MSB8

SUMMARY
Investigation of transcripts (boundaries, expression level, etc.) using strand specific, paired-end RNA sequencing for T. maritima under multiple growth conditions. The new genome annotation has been approved by Genbank [CP004077, pending release of the manuscript].

DESIGN
Four distinct growth conditions were sequenced after isolating total RNA on cultures grown in maltose minimal media. Growth conditions included logphase, late exponential, heat shock and hydrogen inhibion.
