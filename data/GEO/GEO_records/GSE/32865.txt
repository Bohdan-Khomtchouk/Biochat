TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to air plasma treatment

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
In this study, we present a follow up investigation on the effects of argon plasma on vegetative growing Bacillus subtilis 168 (see GSE27113). A growth chamber system suitable for low temperature gas plasma treatment of bacteria in liquid medium enabled a first glimpse on the complex cellular response. In order to gain further knowledge, a second kind of plasma treatment was applied and combined proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were used to investigate the specific stress response of B. subtilis cells to treatment with not only argon but also air plasma. Besides similar cellular responses, due to both argon and air plasma treatment, a variety of different responses such as growth retardation and morphological changes were observed. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific response to DNA damages and oxidative stress. The biological findings such as oxidative stress responses were supported by the detection of reactive plasma species by OES and FTIR measurements.

DESIGN
Cells were grown in LB medium. At OD540 of 0.5, air plasma treatment was set for 15 min with a discharge power of 7.4 W. Samples for mircroarray analysis were taken 5 min after the 15 min plasma treatment. Microarray hybridizations were performed with RNA from three biological replicates. The individual samples were labeled with Cy5; a reference pool containing equal amounts of RNA from all samples was labeled with Cy3.
