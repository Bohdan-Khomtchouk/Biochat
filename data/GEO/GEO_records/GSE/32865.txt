TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to air plasma treatment

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
In this study, we present a follow up investigation on the effects of argon plasma on vegetative growing Bacillus subtilis 168 (see GSE27113). A growth chamber system suitable for low temperature gas plasma treatment of bacteria in liquid medium enabled a first glimpse on the complex cellular response. In order to gain further knowledge, a second kind of plasma treatment was applied and combined proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were used to investigate the specific stress response of B. subtilis cells to treatment with not only argon but also air plasma. Besides similar cellular responses, due to both argon and air plasma treatment, a variety of different responses such as growth retardation and morphological changes were observed. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific response to DNA damages and oxidative stress. The biological findings such as oxidative stress responses were supported by the detection of reactive plasma species by OES and FTIR measurements.
