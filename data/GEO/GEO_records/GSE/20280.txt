TITLE
Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:  We generated extensive transcriptional and proteomic profiles from a Her2-driven mouse model of breast cancer that closely recapitulates human breast cancer.  This report makes these data publicly available in raw and processed forms, as a resource to the community.  Importantly, we previously made biospecimens from this same mouse model freely available through a sample repository, so researchers can obtain samples to test biological hypotheses without the need of breeding animals and collecting biospecimens. Experimental design:  Twelve datasets are available, encompassing 841 LC-MS/MS experiments (plasma and tissues) and 255 microarray analyses of multiple tissues (thymus, spleen, liver, blood cells, and breast).  Cases and controls were rigorously paired to avoid bias. Results:  In total, 18,880 unique peptides were identified (PeptideProphet peptide error rate â‰¤1%), with 3884 and 1659 non-redundant protein groups identified in plasma and tissue datasets, respectively.  Sixty-one of these protein groups overlapped between cancer plasma and cancer tissue. Conclusions and clinical relevance:  These data are of use for advancing our understanding of cancer biology, for software and quality control tool development, investigations of analytical variation in MS/MS data, and selection of proteotypic peptides for MRM-MS.  The availability of these datasets will contribute positively to clinical proteomics.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole mouse genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile breast tumors from three Her2/Neu mice compared to normal breast epithelium from two control mice transgenic for TetO-NeuNT only and littermates of the bitransgenic mice. All samples were laser-capture microdissected and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a reference pool of normal adult mouse tissues.
