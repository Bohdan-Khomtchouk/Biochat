TITLE
Gene expression in circulating mononuclear cells after exposure to ultrafine carbon particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood samples were collected before (0 hour) and at 24 hours after exposure from healthy subjects who participated in previous controlled exposures to ultrafine carbon particles (UFP, 50 microg/m3) or filtered air (FA)(n = 3 each). The exposure time was 2 hours. RNA from mononuclear cell fraction ( > 85% lymphocytes) was extracted, amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix HU133 plus 2 microarrays. We used microarray to explore significantly altered genes after ultrafine carbon particle exposure.

DESIGN
Each subject was exposed to filtered air or ultrafine carbon particles. Two peripheral blood samples (pre- and post-exposure) were taken. Mononuclear cells were isolated for gene expression analysis.
