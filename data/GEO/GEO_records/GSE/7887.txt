TITLE
Gene expression profiles of adult ureter isolated from SMGA (Actg2) transgenic mice. (GUDMAP Series ID: 15)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing urogenital system.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of the adult ureter. Keywords: Gene expression analysis of adult mouse ureter

DESIGN
Ureter regions from adult SMGA/EGFP animals were microdissected and total RNA isolated for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix MOE430 microarray chip.
