TITLE
Chip-chip from Jurkat with p300 and pol II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the dynamic interaction of p300 with proximal promoters of human T cells identified a class of genes that rapidly coassemble p300 and RNA polymerase II following mitogen stimulation. We classified the genes that rapidly coassemble p300 and pol II following mitogen stimulation

DESIGN
Comparison the unstimulated to  P/I stimulated pol II and p300 enrichment fold in Jurkat
