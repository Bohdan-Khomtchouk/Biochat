TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of 278 epithelial cells from the mammary glands of pregnant and non-pregnant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary glands were collected from 8 pregnant (12.5 day) mice and 8 non-pregnant adult (10 week old) female mice. Epithelial cells were FACS sorted from the pregnant mice. Cells from the adult mice were FACS sorted as basal or luminal. Freshly sorted cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. Cells were visualized under the microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to achieve 75 bp paired-end reads.

DESIGN
112 basal cells and 43 luminal cells were profiled from the adult mice. 123 total epithelial cells were profiled from the pregnant mice.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
