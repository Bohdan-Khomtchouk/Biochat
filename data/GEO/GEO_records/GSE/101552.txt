TITLE
RNA-Seq profile of PSGL-1loCD4+ T cells from chronic GVHD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our studies have shown that CD44hiCD62LloPSGL-1loCD4+ T (PSGL-1loCD4+ T) cells play an important role in chronic GVHD pathogenesis (R. Deng et al: Nature Communications 2017).  Thus, PSGL-1loCD4+ T cells were sorted from spleen of chronic GVHD BALB/c recipient mice transplanted with spleen cells and T cell-depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) cells from C57BL/6 donor mice. The control no GVHD BALB/c recipient mice were transplanted with C57BL/6 donor TCD-BM only.  21 days after transplantation, PSGL-1loCD4+ T cells from spleen of chronic GVHD and control mice were sorted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Spleen cells from 8 chronic GVHD recipients or control recipients were combined. PSGL-1loCD4+ T cells from each group were sorted with flow cytometry. mRNA of sorted PSGL-1lo cells were extracted and RNA-seq was performed with duplicates.
