TITLE
Evidence that cryptic promoters occur extensively throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to identify all cryptic promoters in the S. cerevisiae genome that are activated in spt6 and spt16 mutants.  These experiments showed that cryptic initiation is widespread, occurring in approximately 1,000 genes.
