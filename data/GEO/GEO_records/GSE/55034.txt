TITLE
DNA methylation and gene expression analysis during myogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation has been considered to play an important role during myogenic differentiation. In terminal differentiation of myoblasts, chronological alteration of DNA methylation status was poorly understood. Using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we validated genome wide DNA methylation profiles of human myoblast differentiation models. To investigate correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression, we also assessed gene expression of myoblasts with GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of myoblasts (4 samples) were generated with GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix). This submission represents transcriptome component of study.
