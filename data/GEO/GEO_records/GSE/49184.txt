TITLE
The gene expression upon dominant negative form of GAS2 (GAS2DN) in MEG-01 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GAS2DN could suppress the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia cells, including K562, MEG-01 and CD34+ cells from patients. In addition, GAS2DN inhibited the tumorigenic ability of MEG-01 cells in nude mice. To understand the molecular insight of this inhibitory effect of GAS2DN, global gene expression were performed. The control and GAS2DN-transduced MEG-01 cells were used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Three biological independent extracts of control and GAS2DN-transduced cells were pooled together with equal amount, and then the pooled samples were compared with Affymetrix chips.
