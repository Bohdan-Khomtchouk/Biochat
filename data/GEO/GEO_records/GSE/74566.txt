TITLE
The role of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in development of acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
OBJECTIVE: MEIS1, a HOX cofactor, collaborates with multiple HOX proteins, such as HOXA9, to accelerate the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. To further resolve these mechanisms, we conducted a structure-function analysis of Meis1 and miRNA expression profiling, in the context of Hoxa9 leukemogenesis. RESULTS: We show, in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, that the homeodomain of Meis1 is required for leukemogenic collaboration with Hoxa9. miRNA expression profiling of a Hoxa9 preleukemic cell line transduced with wild-type or Meis1 homeodomain mutant reveal deregulation of multiple miRNA including a set not previously implicated as Meis1 targets.
