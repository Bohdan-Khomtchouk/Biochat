TITLE
Three human glioma stem cell lines sorted for CD133 and one human neural precursor line sorted for CD133 to identify tumor-specific miRNA dysregulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several novel potential oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs were identified by using the appropriate controls for stem cells. Expression profiles for human miRNAs in six samples were generated.

DESIGN
The Agilent platform GPL7731 was used to analyze six RNA samples: CD133- human NPC, CD133+ human NPC, CD133- B4 glioma, CD133+ B4 Glioma, CD133+  NCH441 glioma, CD133+ NCH644 glioma

PLATFORM
GPL8227 Agilent-019118 Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B (miRNA ID version)
