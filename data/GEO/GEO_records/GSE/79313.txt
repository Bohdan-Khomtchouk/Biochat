TITLE
Allele specific deletion of enhancer clusters within mouse F1 embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide data from several targeted deletions of transcriptional enhancer clusters within mouse F1 embryonic stem (ES) cells.  We targeted these regions for deletion with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools.  We demonstrate through heterozygous enhancer cluster deletion and  allele specific RNA-seq that enhancer clusters differ in their regulatory activity as the magnitude of the observed change in transcription upon enhancer cluster deletion varies greatly.

DESIGN
Strand specific RNA-seq after heterozygous or homozygous enhancer cluster deletion in mouse F1 ES cells (M. musculus129 x M. castaneus)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
