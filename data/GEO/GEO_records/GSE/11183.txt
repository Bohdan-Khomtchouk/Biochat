TITLE
Identification of the Escherichia coli HU regulon

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The physiological role of the various nucleoid-associated proteins in bacteria and HU in particular has been addressed in a number of studies but remains so far not fully understood. In this work, a genome-wide microarray hybridization approach, combined with in vivo genetic experimentation, has been performed in order to compare and evaluate the effect of HUalpha, HUbeta and HUalphabeta on the transcription of the Escherichia coli K12 genes as a function of growth phase. The histone-like protein HU is present in the E. coli cell under three dimeric forms (HUalphabeta, HUalpha2 and HUbeta2) in a ratio that varies with growth phase. The experimental protocol is designed to handle strain genotype and growth phase as independent variables. Keywords: genotype, growth phase

DESIGN
We used microarrays to investigate global bacterial gene expression in five genotypes of E. coli C600: WT (JO2057), hupA (JO2081), hupB (JO2083), hupAB (JO3020) and rpoS (MW30) at three growth growth phases: exponential, transition and stationary and in three growth media: LB, M9 minimal Glucose and M9 minimal Glycerol. The most relevant experiments were carried out in duplicate: the wild type (JO2057) and the hupAB (JO3020) strains were tested in the exponential and stationary phase, in LB. Wild type and hupAB strains were also tested in single experiments at the transition phase in LB. The single hupA (JO2081) and single hupB (JO2083) mutants were tested at the three growth phases in LB. Wild type and hupAB strains were compared in single experiments both in M9 Minimal Glucose and M9 Minimal Glycerol at the exponential and stationary phase. The last chips were used to test respectively the rpoS mutant at the at the exponential and stationary phase in LB.
