TITLE
Identification of the Escherichia coli HU regulon

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
The physiological role of the various nucleoid-associated proteins in bacteria and HU in particular has been addressed in a number of studies but remains so far not fully understood. In this work, a genome-wide microarray hybridization approach, combined with in vivo genetic experimentation, has been performed in order to compare and evaluate the effect of HUalpha, HUbeta and HUalphabeta on the transcription of the Escherichia coli K12 genes as a function of growth phase. The histone-like protein HU is present in the E. coli cell under three dimeric forms (HUalphabeta, HUalpha2 and HUbeta2) in a ratio that varies with growth phase. The experimental protocol is designed to handle strain genotype and growth phase as independent variables. Keywords: genotype, growth phase
