TITLE
Exon array analysis of two human cell lines (HEK293T Ramos B cell)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to compare previously generated transcriptome data by second generation sequencing (Sultan et al. Science 2008), we interrogated the human Affymetrix exon chips 1.0ST using the same source of material.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates from HEK293T and B cell lines were hybridized on the    human Affymetrix exon chips 1.0ST
