TITLE
Global microRNA expression profiling of microdissected tissues from diseased and non-diseased pancreatic tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microRNA expression profiling of microdissected pancreatic tissues were collected using Agilent miRNA microarrays (G4470B, Sanger 10.1) carrying 723 individual human miRNA probes. Four different sources of RNA were analyzed: microdissected normal pancreatic ductal cells (ND, n=4),microdissected acinar cells (AC, n=4),  macrodissected chronic pancreatitis (CP, n=5) and micordissected xenograft tissues derived from primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC, n=5).

DESIGN
Four condition (AZ, ND, PDAC, CP), each condition is represented by 4 to 5 biological replicates
