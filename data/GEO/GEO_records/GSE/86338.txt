TITLE
RNA profiling to describe the transcriptional change during white fat browning, brown fat activity and inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Enhancing brown fat activity and promoting white fat browning are attractive therapeutic strategies for obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. To provide a comprehensive picture of the regulatory network in these processes, we conducted a series of transcriptome studies by RNA-seq and quantified the mRNA and lncRNA changes during white fat browning induced by chronic cold exposure, beta-adrenergic agonist and intensive exercises, brown fat activation by acute cold exposure and inactivation by thermoneutrality.

DESIGN
18 RNA-seqs were performed with 2-3 replicates for each experiment.
