TITLE
ChIP-chip of Sigma70 and RNAP Beta in vivo in E. coli MG1655

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
These data were used to infer the genome-wide localization of sigma70 and core RNAP beta subunit for the study " The transition between transcriptional initiation and elongation in E. coli is highly variable and often rate-limiting " (Reppas et al. 2006). This study analyzes transfrags with respect to the ChIP profile of the sigma70 and the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. Keywords: ChIP-chip; tiled analysis of mRNA expression

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from duplicate cell cultures, which were also used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of sigma70- and RNA polymerase beta-crosslinked DNA.
