TITLE
Identification of novel copy number alterations by high-resolution aCGH from FFPE cutaneous melanoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated a cohort of 34 archival cutaneous melanoma samples by Agilent 40 kb-resolution CGH array.  We found a non-random distribution of precise CNAs predictive for clinical outcome. Although most of the alterations defined in this study have been already reported, we mapped novel melanoma-specific CNAs at highest accuracy. Moreover, our data revealed distinct amplifications hotspots, some of which were validated by quantitative real-time PCR, enabling the identification of novel melanoma oncogenic candidates. Keywords: Cutaneous melanoma, Copy number alterations, Biomarkers, FFPE

DESIGN
We examined 34 primary melanoma formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples by using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Genomic DNA was extracted, referred to a sex-matched diploid commercial control DNA (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, cat. G1417 and G1521), and hybridized on the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 8x60k, cat. G4827A.
