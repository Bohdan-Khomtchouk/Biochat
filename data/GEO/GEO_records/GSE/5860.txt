TITLE
Gene expression analysis of rat livers after exposure to acetaminophen

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male F344 rats were expsoed to sub-toxic (50 or 150 mg/kg) or toxic (1500 or 2000 mg/kg) doses of acetaminophen. RNa was extracted from livers and gene expression analysis was performed on Agilent rat oligonucleotide chips. Keywords: Competitive hybridization

DESIGN
