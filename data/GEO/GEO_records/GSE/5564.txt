TITLE
Notch Signaling in Glial Development

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Animal pole tissue explants were dissected from either untreated embryos or embryos injected with 1 ng of Notch Intracellular Domain RNA (NICD) at the two cell stage.  Tissue explants were dissected and cultured until sibling embryos reached embryonic stage 20. Each array hybridization represents a biological replicate containing approximately 100 tissue explants. Expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip 1 arrays. Keywords: repeat
