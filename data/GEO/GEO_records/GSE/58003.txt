TITLE
Gene expression in Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in the presence or absence of Necrotic cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish danger signal induced inflammatory response.   BMDM from C57/BL6 mice cultred in the presence or absence of heat shock necrotic A20 cells for 1hr.

DESIGN
Control sample (Non_4) is  'BMDM in the absence of necrotic A20 cells' and reference sample (Dead_4) is 'BMDM in the presence of necrotic A20 cells'

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
