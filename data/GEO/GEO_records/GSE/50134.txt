TITLE
Recurrent copy number alterations are associated with poor prognosis and HPV infection in penile carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used to evaluate DNA copy number alterations related and non related to HPV infection status aiming to identify potential molecular markers in penile cancer (PC).

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from thirty-eight fresh frozen PC samples and submitted to HPV genotyping and array-CGH. Commercial male reference samples (Promega) were used as normal controls. Specific genomic alterations were investigated by qPCR and FISH methodologies.
