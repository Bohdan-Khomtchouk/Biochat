TITLE
Expression data from mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Winged bean (WB), Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, is a tropical legume, the potential of which is not yet been understood. We found that a 5 week-oral administration of WB seed extract inhibited wrinkle formation induced by repeated tape stripping (TS), which is a model of lichenification in human chronic eczematous dermatitis. To elucidate mechanism of the effect of WB on this model, we applied microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Skin barrier was disrupted by repeated application and removal (tape stripping; TS) of cellophane tape on the dorsal skin of the left side. This procedure was started after 1 week-administration of winged bean (WB) extract, and was conducted 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Dorsal skin samples from three experimental groups were used for microarray experiment. These groups were the non-TS (NT), TS, and TS with oral administration of WB extract (TS/WB). The DNA microarray experiment was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
