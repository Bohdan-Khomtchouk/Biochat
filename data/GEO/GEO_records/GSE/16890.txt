TITLE
NCI-H1299 cell line transfected with human DENND2D and vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression for NCI-H1299 cell line transfected with human DENND2D and vector (pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA vector) respectively.

DESIGN
The microarray experiment was designed to perform four replicates for each H1299-DENND2D and H1299-vector sample. cRNA used in replication 1 and 2 was from the same label reaction to perform the hybridization replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
