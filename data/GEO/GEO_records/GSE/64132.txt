TITLE
Gene expression profile of wild-type and isoniazid resistant strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Understanding emergence of drug resistance in pathogens systematically is a major challenge. To address this issue, lab-evolved strain resistant to first-line tuberculosis drug, isoniazid (INH), was analysed. Transcriptome analysis of different conditions revealed genes that are differentially regulated in wild-type (WT) and isoniazid resistant (2XR and 4XR) strains. Microarray analysis was performed for WT, sub-MIC, 2XR and 4XR strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Overall, the numbers of DEGs observed are 1529 in sub-MIC (596 - up, 933 - down), 1381 (899 – up, 482 – down) in 2XR and 716 in 4XR (267 – up, 449 – down) conditions. 52 of them are seen to be up-regulated across all drug concentrations as compared to WT while 185 are seen to be down-regulated in all. Transcriptome analysis revealed that there are variations in gene expression pattern in the resistant strains as compared to WT strain. This indicates that differential regulation of genes is, in some way, responsible for conferring the phenotype to the organism.
