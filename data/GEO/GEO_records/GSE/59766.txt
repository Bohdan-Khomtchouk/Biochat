TITLE
Leishmania major Friedlin V1 lpg1- and lpg2- mutants differentially modulate the Interleukin-12 immune response in human dendritic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) were infected with Leishmania major parasites which were knockout mutants of either lpg1 or lpg2 genes that responsible for expression of surface molecular structures on the parasites in order to assess the effects those molecules have on human host cell gene expression.

DESIGN
Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC) were generated from blood buffy coats collected from four anonymous healthy human donors and infected 10:1 (parasite to host cell) with Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain wildtype parasites and lipophosphogylcan mutants, where after total RNA was harvested, cDNA generated, and hybridized to human gene transcipt expression arrays to assess differential host cell gene transcriptional expression differences relative to uninfected cells. Please note that the final RMA normalized background value for each array was provided in the characteristics field and any data that was below the background value was filtered out.
