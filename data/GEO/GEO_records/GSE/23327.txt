TITLE
Lung biopsies from sensitized or control rhesus macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate differential expression in a house dust mite (HDM) exposure model of asthma in rhesus macaques. HDM sensitization was performed by subcutaneous injection of HDM followed by intranasal HDM for 2-3 hours twice a week.

DESIGN
Animals were mock-sensitized (PBS) or sensitized to HDM antigen.  Gene expression was measured in lung biopsies before and fifteen weeks after treatment.
