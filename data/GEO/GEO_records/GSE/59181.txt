TITLE
Genomic landscape of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We undertook ChIP-Seq of HA-tagged EBNA3A in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines to understand the effects of this essential viral transcription factor on the cell DNA. We discovered that EBNA3A bound to DNA with BATF, IRF4 and RUNX3, making these Transcription Factors the ones that tether EBNA3A to DNA, allowing it to mediate its downstream effects.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of 2 biological replicates of HA-tagged EBNA3A were performed. Input was obtained by reverse-crosslinking the cross-linked DNA

PLATFORM
