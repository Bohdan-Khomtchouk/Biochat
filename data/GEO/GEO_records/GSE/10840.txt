TITLE
Meiotic time course of the trimethylation of the Lysine 4 of Histone H3 (H3K4me3)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To study the meiotic dynamic of the methylation of H3K4, in relation with the transcriptomic regulation, we determine the meiotic time-course of H3K4me3 by ChIP-chip. Keywords: ChIP-chip, meiotic time course, histone modification

DESIGN
Strain ORD7339 meiotic time-course from 0 to 6h. Immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-triMe H3K4 (Abcam #Ab8580).

PLATFORM
GPL4131 Agilent-014810 Yeast Whole Genome ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 4x44K (G4493A)
