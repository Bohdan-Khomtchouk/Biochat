TITLE
The role of SMCHD1 in the formation of constitutive heterochromatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A large portion of the mammalian genome is assembled into constitutive heterochromatin which is highly compact and transcriptionally silent throughout the cell cycle. On the molecular level it is characterized by DNA methylation, “repressive” histone marks (hypoacethylation, H3K9 trimethylation, H4K20 trimethylation) and the presence of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Regions of constitutive heterochromatin such as telomeres, pericentromeres and centromeres play a critical role in the maintenance of the genome integrity. Using a technique called Proteomics of Isolated Chromatin Segments (PICh) we have identified SMCHD1 as a novel component of telomeres and pericentomeres. SMCHD1 was previously shown to be involved in the inactivaction of the X chromosome and imprinting, but the its exact role in these processes is not understood. Our study aims to unravel the role of SMCHD1 in the formation and/or maintenance of constitutive chromatin. Using human cancer cells as research model we are trying to discover its mechanism of action by identifying its interacting partners, characterizing its genome wide binding sites and characterizing the effect of SMCHD1 knockout on the heterochromatin function.
