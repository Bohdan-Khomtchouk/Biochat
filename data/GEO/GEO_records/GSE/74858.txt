TITLE
Long-noncoding RNAs in basal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 3 patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 3 healthy individuals (control; non-lesional skin) were enrolled in the study. Punch biopsies (4 mm) were obtained under local anaesthesia and immediately put in RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored at - 80 Â°C until RNA extraction.

DESIGN
The lncRNA and mRNA expression in BCC was compared to lncRNA and mRNA expression in non-lesional skin (control).
