TITLE
FoxO1 Deacetylation Decreases Fatty Acid Oxidation in beta-cells and Sustains Insulin Secretion in Diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction contributes to onset and progression of type 2 diabetes. In this state beta-cells become metabolically inflexible, losing the ability to select between carbohydrates and lipids as substrates for mitochondrial oxidation. These changes lead to beta-cell dedifferentiation. We have proposed that FoxO proteins are activated through deacetylation-dependent nuclear translocation to forestall the progression of these abnormalities. However, how deacetylated FoxO exert their actions remains unclear. To address this question, we analyzed islet function in mice homozygous for knock-in alleles encoding deacetylated FoxO1 (6KR). Islets expressing 6KR mutant FoxO1 have enhanced insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo, and decreased fatty acid oxidation ex vivo. Remarkably, the gene expression signature associated with FoxO1 deacetylation differs from wild-type by only ~2% of the > 4,000 genes regulated in response to re-feeding. But this narrow swath includes key genes required for beta-cell identity, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial fatty acid and solute transport. The data support the notion that deacetylated FoxO1 protects beta-cell function by limiting mitochondrial lipid utilization, and raise the possibility that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in Î²-cells is beneficial to diabetes treatment.
