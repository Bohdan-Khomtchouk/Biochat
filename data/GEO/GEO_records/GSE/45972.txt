TITLE
Thermotolerance in B. subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
During thermotolerance development, B. subtilis cells can be primed by a short mild heat shock to survive a subsequent severe, otherwise lethal, heat stress. We wanted to assess the influence of transcriptional regulation during thermotolerance development in B. subtilis. We prepared total RNA of four differently treated samples of B. subtilis cells. For this purpose, exponential B. subtilis cells grown at 37 °C were divided and exposed for additional 15 min to temperatures of 37 °C, 48 °C, 53 °C or 15 min 48 °C followed by 15 min at 53 °C.

DESIGN
Using four different merged dye swap experiments of red or green labelled cDNA of the above described RNA preparations, we compared and analyzed the transcriptional change of the conditions 48 °C vs. 53/48 °C (array 1), 37 °C vs. 53 °C (array 2), 37 °C vs. 48 °C (array 3) and especially 37/53°C vs. 53/48 °C (array 4)
