SUMMARY
This experiment set is used for the manuscript entitled: Pharmacogenomics of Interferon-b therapy in multiple sclerosis: Baseline IFN signature determines pharmacological differences between patients. In this study we generated and analyzed pre- and post- IFNb treatment gene expression patterns of RRMS patients with the aim of identifying pre-existing and/or drug-induced signatures that will allow us to make predictions on the expected pharmacological effects of IFNb treatment. We show that the expression level of IFN response genes prior to treatment, determines the pharmacological differences between patients with MS at the molecular level. A group of 16 Dutch patients (10 females and 6 males) with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS was recruited from the outpatient clinic of the MS Centre Amsterdam. Mean age at start of IFNb therapy is 40.6 +/- 7.7, mean EDSS is 2.3 +/- 1.3 (range 1-6). Blood samples were obtained just before treatment and 1 month after start of the therapy. Patients received Avonex, Betaferon, Rebif 22 or Rebif 44. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed.
