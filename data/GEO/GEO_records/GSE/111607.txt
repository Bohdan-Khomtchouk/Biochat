TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of the leaves in doubled haploid and autotetraploid Chinese cabbages

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis

SUMMARY
We performed transcript profiling of doubled haploids and autotetraploids that generated from a Chinese cabbage doubled haploid line ‘FT’ using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform and analyzed differential gene expression at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
mRNA levels were examinated in doubled haploid and autotetraploid leaves of Chinese cabbage, in three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL24708 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis)
