TITLE
Expression profiling on HPSE deleted SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HPSE plays important roles in gastric cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis.The aim of this study is to explore molecular mechanism underling roles of HPSE in gastric cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration and metastasis.

DESIGN
SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells were transfected with HPSE siRNA (10nM) or scramble control siRNA, RNA were extracted 24hours after transfectioin and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. 3 biological repeats were used for each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
