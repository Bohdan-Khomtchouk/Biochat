TITLE
In silico gene expression profiling of Cannabis sativa

ORGANISM
Cannabis sativa

SUMMARY
Even if a large amount of high-throughput functional genomic data exists, most researchers feature a strong background in molecular biology but lack advanced bioinformatics skills. In this work, publicly available gene expression datasets have been analyzed giving rise to a total of 40,224 gene expression profiles within different Cannabis tissues/developmental stages. The resource here proposed will provide researchers with a starting point for future investigations of Cannabis sativa.

DESIGN
Thirty-one publicly available RNA-seq datasets have been re-analyzed from BioProject PRJNA80055 (SRA Study SRP006678) and BioProject PRJNA73819 (SRA Study SRP008673). Details of the 31 re-analyzed samples and data processing can be found in Readme.txt. Re-analysis results can be found in Gene_expression_counts.txt.
