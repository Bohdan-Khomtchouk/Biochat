TITLE
Genome-wide maps of human OEC innate immune responses to Burkholderia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a transcriptional response in human OECs that encompasses multiple innate immune networks not previously associated with these cells. Major pathways included immune cell trafficking, and differential cytokine production

DESIGN
We used RNA-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of innate immune responses in human OECs and the role of Burkholderia in triggering these responses
