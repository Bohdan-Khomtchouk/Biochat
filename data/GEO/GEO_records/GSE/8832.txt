TITLE
K562 Gene Expression Control vs 1R-Chl treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether the polyamide-Chl conjugate 1R-Chl would cause similar changes in global gene expression in K562 cells, affymetrix gene chip analysis was performed using 1R-Chl.  Through class comparison analysis, 1R-Chl affected the levels of transcription and genes of interest were determined. Keywords: Treatment response
