TITLE
K562 Gene Expression Control vs 1R-Chl treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether the polyamide-Chl conjugate 1R-Chl would cause similar changes in global gene expression in K562 cells, affymetrix gene chip analysis was performed using 1R-Chl.  Through class comparison analysis, 1R-Chl affected the levels of transcription and genes of interest were determined. Keywords: Treatment response

DESIGN
K562 cells were incubated with 1R-Chl (at 250 nM) or in the absence of polyamide, in triplicate for 24 h before RNA purification and microarray analysis at The Scripps Research Institute microarray facility.  Affymetrix U133A Plus 2.0 GeneChips were hybridized in groups of three for each of the two groups.  The Affymetrix probe set data were imported into BRB Arraytools (3.5.0 Beta 2), selecting the U133 chips used in the experiment and leaving all filters off.
