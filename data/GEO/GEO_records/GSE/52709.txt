TITLE
The complete methylome of hematopoietic stem cells and their immediate progeny

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) constitute a rare cell population in bone-marrow and are capable of live-long self-renewal and production of all mature blood cell types. Cell differentiation processes are governed by epigenetic mechanisms whose study during early differentiation steps will provide insights into stem cell function and differentiation. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on HSCs and their immediate progeny, namely three different multipotent progenitor subpopulations (MPP1, MPP2, and MPP).

DESIGN
Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and 3 different multipotent progenitor subpopulations (MPP). Three independent biological replicates each were analyzed.
