TITLE
WNV- and JEV-infected adult mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Flaviviruses, particularly Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are important causes of virus-induced central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans. We used microarray analysis to identify cellular genes that are differentially regulated following infection of the brain with JEV (P3) or WNV (New York 99). Gene expression data for these flaviviruses was compared to that induced following infection of the brain with reovirus (Type 3 Dearing), an unrelated neurotropic virus. Although several studies have described gene expression changes following virus infection of the brain, this report is the first to directly compare large-scale gene expression data from different viruses. We found that a large number of genes were up-regulated in common to infections with all 3 viruses (fold change > 2, P < 0.001), including genes associated with interferon signaling, the immune system, inflammation and cell death/survival signaling. In addition, genes associated with glutamate signaling were down-regulated in common to infections with all 3 viruses (fold change > 2, P < 0.001). These genes may serve broad spectrum therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease. A distinct set of genes were up-regulated following flavivirus-infection, but not following infection with reovirus. These genes were associated with tRNA charging and may serve as therapeutic targets for flavivirus-induce CNS disease.
