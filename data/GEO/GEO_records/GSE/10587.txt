TITLE
Gene expression in stria vascularis of mice lacking Slc26a4 and heterzygous controls before the onset of hearing.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of differential expression of genes in the stria vascularis of  pendrin (Slc26a4) heterozygous and knockout  mice before the onset of hearing at postnatal day 10 (P10). Keywords: differential expression under disease state

DESIGN
A total of Six samples  of stria vascularis RNA obtained from P10 mice were analyzed.  Triplicates from  pendrin (Slc26a4) heterozygous and knockout mice were run and analyzed.
