TITLE
Microarray analysis of the lncRNAs expression profile in human apheresis platelets during storage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in human apheresis platelet during the storage, and predict the potential biological function of lncRNAs in the process of platelet storage lesion. LncRNAs profiles of platelets were tested by Agilent Human lncRNA Array at 2nd, 5th, and 8th day during storage. Seven lncRNAs and four mRNAs were chosen to validate by real-time PCR, the result was consistent with the microarray. Bioinformatics method was applied to predict the function of lncRNAs.

DESIGN
Platelet samples were collected from 13 male healthy donors with O blood group.Apheresis platelets were stored at 22±2 ℃ in storage tank and 10 ml sample were collected at 2 day, 5 day, 8 day. Three groups in these samples were used for microarray analysis and the other ten groups were used for qPCR.
