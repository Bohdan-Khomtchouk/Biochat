TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 array data for EBF1-PDGFRB rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The EBF1-PDGFRB gene fusion accounts for < 1% B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and occurs within the Philadelphia-like ALL subtype. We performed Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array was undertaken patients who tested positive for EBF1-PDGFRB rearrangement by FISH and/or RT-PCR.

DESIGN
We performed Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array on genomic DNA extracted from bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis in 9 patients, at relapse in one patient and at remission in one patient.
