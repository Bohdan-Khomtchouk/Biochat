TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles between Nodal-overexpressing embryos with control embryos

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A comprehensive search for downstream genes is necessary for understanding of functions of Nodal signaling in embryos of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.  The level of mRNA expression in Nodal-overexpressing embryos was compared with that in normal embryos at the late gastrula stage by a microarray analysis.  Overexpression of Ci-nodal elevated the level of expression of 115 genes more than two-fold.  These candidate target genes include those encoding transcription factors, proteins involved in cell-cell communication, and extracellular matrix components.  Many of these genes were expressed in the neural plate at the late gastrula stage.  Overexpression of nodal also affected the expression of genes involved in the planar cell polarity pathway and Wnt/Ca2+ pathway (prickle, Rho-like2, and PLC2), and delta1-protocadherin-like. Keywords: ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, Nodal, embryogenesis, gene expression profile
