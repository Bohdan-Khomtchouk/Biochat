TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of dendritic cell Transcriptomes during LPS response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The purpose of this study is to detect activated or silenced genes during LPS-induced dendritic cell. Gene expression differences between two samples could be found using transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) analysis. Methods:Mouse dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow cells in  RPMI-1640 medium with recombinant mouse GM-CSF and IL-4, immature DCs were obtained before or after LPS stimulation. Immature DCs were sorted respectively based on marker CD86 and Iab(MHCII) using flowcytrometer. DC mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing,using Illumina. Results: We mapped about 10 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome, identified hundreds of genes with significant mRNA variation during LPS stimulation.

DESIGN
