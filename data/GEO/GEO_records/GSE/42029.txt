TITLE
Silencing of OsMADS29 in Oryza sativa var. PB1

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
RNAi mediated suppression of MADS29 severely affects seed set; the surviving seeds are smaller in size with reduced grain filling, abnormal starch grains and aberrant embryo development. To identify the affected pathways  due to suppression of this transcription factor in the transgenic seeds, transcriptome analysis using microarray was carried out.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of MADS29 RNAi (silencing) lines and Wild Type PB1 (control) plants were used for microarray study
