TITLE
ACTG A5258 Clinical administration of chloroquine to HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to reduce immune activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ACTG A5258, we asked whether chloroquine could reduce the immune activation in HIV infection posited to be driven by microbial TLR agonists, such as  bacterial elements translocated from the gut and HIV-1 RNAs . We anticipate that blocking this activation pathway might interfere with events in pathogenesis leading to AIDS- and non-AIDS-related clinical manifestations of HIV disease.

DESIGN
Blood samples were taken from 20 individuals at week 0 (before treatement) and week 12. 10 individuals received chloroquine 250mg orally and 10 individuals received placebo.
