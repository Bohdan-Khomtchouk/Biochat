TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 butyrate stress (29 mM)

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Metabolite accumulation has pleiotropic, including toxic, effects on cellular physiology, but such effects are not well understood at the genomic level.  Using DNA microarrays, the Clostridium acetobutylicum transcriptional stress response to butyrate was analyzed. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from both butyrate challenged  (29 mM) and unchallenged bottles at 10, 30, 45, 60 (1h), 120 (2h), 360 (6h) and 720 (12h) poststress. Two slides per timepoint were hybridized on a dye swap configuration.
