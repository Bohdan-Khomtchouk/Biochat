TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide accessibility following acute deletion of Ring1b in mouse embryonic stem cells [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Knockout of the PRC1 catalytic subunit Ring1b does not induce widespread accessibility increases at bivalent TSSs as measured by ATAC-seq. Instead, accessibility changes are enriched at enhancers.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic accessibility using ATAC-seq in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing conditional knockout alleles of the PRC1 subunit Ring1b. For Ring1a-null;Ring1b-CreER (Ring1bflfl) conditional knockout cells, ATAC was performed 72 h after treatment with either ethanol (EtOH) or 0.8 uM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Tam).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
