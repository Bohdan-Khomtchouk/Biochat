TITLE
Murine retina: Control vs. experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse retina comparing naïve mouse and experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU)-developing mouse. EAU was induced by immunization of retinal autoantigens in adjuvants. Retinas were harvested 14 days after immunization.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Naïve retinal cells vs. EAU-developing mouse retinal cells on day 14. 3 control, 3 EAU-developing, independently harvested.
