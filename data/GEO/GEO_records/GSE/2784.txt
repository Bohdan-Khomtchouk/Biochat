TITLE
GSC differentiation-reversion test

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
gene expression is tested for an association with GSCs by comparing expression levels in ovary tips of c587-GAL4; hs-bam  UAS-dpp females at 0 hr, 20 hr and 50 hr after heat shock ;  results of two independent experiments are given as expt 1 and expt 2 Keywords: time course, heat shock, bam overexpression

DESIGN
0 hr  ovary tips contain many GSCs 20 hr  hs-bam has induced differentiation of all GSCs 50 hr  Bam has turned over and cystocytes have reverted to become GSCs again see Kai et al. (2005) Dev. Biol.
