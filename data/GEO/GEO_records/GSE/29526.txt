TITLE
Expression profile of 16C ovarian follicle cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We use DSN normalized RNA-seq to transcriptionally profile FACS sorted 16C ovarian follicle cells. These data provide insights into the developmental control of gene expression programmed gene amplificaton.

DESIGN
Follicle cells were isolated from whole ovaries by trypsinization and filtering and stained with Hoescht. 16C follicle cells were isolated by FACS sorting based on DNA content (Hoescht). RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent and 100ng of total RNA and used to generate a total library. This library was then subjected to DSN normalization prior to Illumina based sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9061 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Drosophila melanogaster)
