TITLE
Expression profile of 16C ovarian follicle cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We use DSN normalized RNA-seq to transcriptionally profile FACS sorted 16C ovarian follicle cells. These data provide insights into the developmental control of gene expression programmed gene amplificaton.
