TITLE
Modulation of cardiomyocyte gene expression by n-3 PUFA supplementation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Despite the recognized protective effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in cardiovascular diseases, and the demonstration of the control of gene expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the effects of these n-3 fatty acids on the whole genoma has never been investigated in cardiac cells. Using rat arrays, the effects of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on the global gene expression profile were evaluated in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Keywords: nutritional intervention, treatment response
