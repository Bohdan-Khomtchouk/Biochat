TITLE
Expression profiling of mice exposed to multiwalled carbon nanotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were aspirated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes in four doses ranging from 10 µg to 80 µg, plus control, and sacrificed after 1, 7, 28, and 56 days. RNA was extracted from the lungs and expression profilling by microarray was performed.

DESIGN
This is a reference design two-color experiment. Each array was hybridized with RNA extracted from mouse lung labeled with Cy3, and universal reference RNA labeled with Cy5. Five different doses (0, 10ug, 20ug, 40ug, and 80ug) of multiwalled carbon nanotube aspiration were used and mice were sacrificed after 1, 7, 28, and 56 days. Eight replicates were used at each time/dose condition for a total of 160 arrays.
