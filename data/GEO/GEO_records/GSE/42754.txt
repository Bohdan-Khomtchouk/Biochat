TITLE
Suppression of prp28-1 splicing defect by prp8-tes allele

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DEAD-box proteins, a family of RNA-dependent ATPases, promote the numerous conformational rearrangements required for spliceosome assembly, activation, and disassembly. Previous work showed that a cold-sensitive substitution in DEAD-box protein Prp28 prevents the switch from U1 to U6 snRNA pairing with the 5â€™ splice site. Little is known about how Prp28 is regulated, although U5 snRNP protein Prp8 is a potential coordinator of Prp28 and other spliceosomal ATPases. We conducted a targeted selection in Prp8 for cold-insensitive suppressors of prp28-1, then used splicing specific microarrays to assess suppression of the prp28-1 splicing defect.

DESIGN
Splicing specific microarrays were used to assess suppression of the prp28-1 splicing defect by a prp8 allele (prp8-tes) that suppresses prp28-1 cold-sensitivity
