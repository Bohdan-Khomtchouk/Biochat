TITLE
Characterization of Paf1 complex occupancy in mouse myoblasts and myotubes under control conditions or Phf5a knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf5a regulates occupancy of Paf1 complex in mouse myotubes. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex in mouse myoblasts or myotubes under conditions of shControl or shPhf5a knockdown. These results revealed that downregualtion of Phf5a results in significant decrease of Leo1 binding to its targets in myotubes.

DESIGN
Ten million cells were used for the ChIP and precipitated using 5 micrograms of respective antibodies. Original reference: Zhu B. et al. (2005) " The human PAF complex coordinates transcription with events downstream of RNA synthesis "
