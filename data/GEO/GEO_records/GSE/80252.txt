TITLE
Gene expression profiling of TH-MYCN mouse neuroblastoma sphere cells and their parental primary tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed microarray gene expression profiling to identify genes essential for the growth and tumorigenicity of mouse neuroblastoma stem-like cells

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on total RNA isolated from three independent lines of mouse neuroblastoma sphere cells and their parental primary tumor cells

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
