TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome of mice fed high fat diets containing palm or linseed oil

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The beneficial effects of dietary long-chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the prevention and/or treatment of some metabolic disorders result largely from their capacity to regulate the transcription level of many genes involved in metabolic and physiological homeostasis, especially in the liver. In this respect, they are known to bind and activate the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPARalpha). The precursor of LC-PUFA, a-linoleic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3) share some beneficial metabolic effects with its LC derivatives, however its role in gene regulation is poorly documented. Here, we analysed the hepatic transcriptome of mice fed for 5 weeks diets rich in either saturated FA from palm oil (PALM group) or ALA from linseed oil (LIN group). This modification of dietary fatty acid composition in a context of a high fat diet had a subtle but significant effect on the hepatic transcriptome. We identified mainly a group of genes that were upregulated in the LIN vs the PALM group and that include several well-known PPARalpha target genes involved in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism.

DESIGN
Liver gene expression was measured in male C57BL/6J mice fed during 5 weeks a high fat diet (51% energy from fat) containing palm oil, rich in saturated fatty acids (n=10) or linseed oil, rich in 18:3 n-3 (n=8)
