TITLE
Characterizing seed weight related genes through transcriptome analyses of wild and cultivated soybeans

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Cultivated soybean has domesticated in China for a long history, and there are several significant phenotypic differences between wild and cultivated soybeans. Seed of cultivar is generally larger than wild soybean, therefore here we comprehensively analyzed transcriptomes of thirteen soybean accessions seeds including seven wild soybeans and six landraces through applying strand-specific RNA sequencing. Differential expressed genes related seed weight were identified, some of them were known to be associated with seed development in Arabidopsis. Noncoding RNAs are known to play important roles in plant development, and we profiled the expression pattern of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in cultivated and wild soybean seeds. We have identified 1,251 long intergenic noncoding RNA, 243 intronic RNA and 81 antisense lncRNA, transcriptional levels of a number of lncRNAs were significantly different between cultivated and wild soybeans, suggesting that lncRNA may be involved in soybean seed development.

DESIGN
High-depth paired-end RNA-seq from wild and cultivated soybeans
