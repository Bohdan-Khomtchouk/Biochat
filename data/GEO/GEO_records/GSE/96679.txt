TITLE
Temperature adaptation effects on BAT metabolism in BAT specific Akt2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are reporting here the effects of adaptation to different ambient temperatures in the whole genome gene expression of interscapular BAT of BAT specific Akt2 knockout mice

DESIGN
Wildtype littermates and brown fat specific Akt2 KO mice (using UCP1-CreER) in B6/J background were adapted to 2 different ambient temperatures (30ºC, 22ºC) for a period of 4 weeks.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
