TITLE
Expression data from rice embryo,endosperm,root,leaf and seedling

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of protein coding genes were characterized using Affymetrix rice genome array to compare with expression profiles of miRNAs. Keywords: tissue

DESIGN
Five tissues (embryo, endosperm, leaf and root of 7-day-old seedlings, 10-day-old seedling) were analyzed, each has two biological repeats.
