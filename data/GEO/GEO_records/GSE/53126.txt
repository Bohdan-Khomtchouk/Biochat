TITLE
Gene expression data from yeast exposure to pyrimethanil

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Pyrimethanil (PYR) is a world-wide used fungicide approved for use in plant protection products in Agriculture, and with some (eco)toxicological concerns.We aimed at finding molecular biomarkers in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that may be used to predict potential cytotoxic effects of this xenobiotic while providing mechanistic clues possibly relevant for experimentally less accessible non-target eukaryotes. We used microarrays to carry out a gene expression profiling analysis in S. cereviseae strain BY4741 upon 2 hours exposure to PYR at concentrations exerting moderate to median levels of phenotypic effects (inhibition of yeast growth rate). Two exposure scenarios were analysed, namely the 20% and 50%-inhibitory concentrations of PYR (IC20 and IC50, respectively), compared to control cells not exposed to the fungicide (CT02).

DESIGN
Exponential standardized cell suspensions of S. cerevisiae BY4741 in minimal growth medium were incubated in the presence of 20 and 110 mg/L of PYR (corresponding to the PYR IC20 and IC50, respectively), or in medium non-supplemented with the fungicide (control cells, CT02) during 2 h, and used for total RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Exposure experiments with both concentrations of PYR and with control cells were carried out together. For each exposure condition, independent biological triplicates were processed and analysed.
