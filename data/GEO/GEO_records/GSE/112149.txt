TITLE
In vitro transcriptomic profiling of P. falciparum under 4 hr artemisinin challenge (900nM), from 10 HPI

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
This dataset pertains to a microarray-based transcriptomic profiling of artemisinin-resistant (6A-R, 11C-R) and artemisinin-sensitive (6A, 11C) P. falciparum under an an in vitro 4 hr artemisinin challenge (900nM), from 10 - 14 HPI

DESIGN
Synchronized parasites were treated with 900nM artemisinin for 4 hrs starting from 10 HPI. Control parasites were treated in parallel with an equivalent volume of DMSO. Parasitized red blood cells (RBCs) were then harvested at 1hr after treatment with artemisinin/DMSO (TP1), 2 hours after treatment artemisinin/DMSO(TP2), and 4 hrs after treatment artemisinin/DMSO (TP3). Extraction of total RNA and amplification of total cDNA was carried out as  described in Bozdech, Z., S. Mok & A. P. Gupta, (2013) DNA microarray-based genome-wide analyses of Plasmodium parasites. Methods in molecular biology 923: 189-211.
