TITLE
Krüppel-like factor 3 KO and rescue expression data in murine embyronic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) is a transcriptional repressor that has roles in adipogenesis, B-cell maturation and erythropoiesis (for review see Pearson et al., 2012). We profiled gene expression in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) where Klf3 had been knocked-out and where the same cell had been rescued with Klf3 using microarrays.

DESIGN
Klf3 KO murine embryonic fibroblast cell lines were produced from Klf3 KO mice.  These cells were rescued with epitope tagged Klf3 (Klf3-V5) using retroviral delivery (murine stem cell virus). Stable clones were selected uner puromycin seletion and total RNA was taken for array
