TITLE
Gene expression array between wild-type and mutant Hnf1b cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The complete specrtum of genes that are subject to regulation by Hnf1b in mouse kidney cells is not known. We used microarray to determine genes that are significenlty deregulated in repsonse to altered HNF1b activity.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured for 24 hrs followed by induction of Dominant-negative HNF1b for 48 hours.
