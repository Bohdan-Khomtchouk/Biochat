SUMMARY
Summary:  	Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a damage to the spinal cord induced by trauma or desease resulting in a loss of mobility or feeling. SCI is characterized by a primary mechanical injury followed by a secondary injury in which several molecular events are altered in the spinal cord often resulting in loss of neuronal function. Hypothesis: 	Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a cascade of molecular events including the activation of genes associated with transcription factors, inflammation, oxidative stress, ionic imbalance, apoptosis and neuroregeneration which suggests the existance of endogenous reparative attempts. However, not all mechanisms following SCI are well known. Specific Aim: 	The goal of this project is to analyze the molecular events following spinal cord injury 1 cm above, below, and at the site of injury (T9), aiming at finding potential new targets to improve recovery and therapy.
