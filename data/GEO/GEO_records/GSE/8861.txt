TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Triclosan on Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to triclosan, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study; antimicrobial response; time course
