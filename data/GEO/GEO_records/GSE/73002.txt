TITLE
A novel combination of serum microRNAs for detecting breast cancer in the early stage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are stably present in serum, have been reported to be potentially useful for detecting cancer. In the present study, we examined the expression profiles of serum miRNAs in large cohorts to identify the miRNAs that can be used to detect breast cancer in the early stage. We comprehensively evaluated serum miRNA expression profiles using highly sensitive microarray analysis. A total of 1,280 serum samples of breast cancer patients stored in the National Cancer Center Biobank were used. Additionally, 2,836 serum samples were obtained from non-cancer controls and 514 from patients with other types of cancers or benign diseases. The samples were divided to a training cohort including non-cancer controls, other cancers and breast cancer and a test cohort including non-cancer controls and breast cancer. The training cohort was used to identify a combination of miRNAs that detect breast cancer, and the test cohort was used to validate that combination. miRNA expression was compared between breast cancer and non-breast cancer serum , and a combination of five miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1307-3p, miR-4634, miR-6861-5p, and miR-6875-5p) was found to detect breast cancer. This combination had a sensitivity of 97.3%, specificity of 82.9%, and accuracy of 89.7% for breast cancer in the test cohort Additionally, the combination could detect breast cancer in the early stage (sensitivity of 98.0% for T0).

DESIGN
1280 breast cancer serums (74 in training cohort, 1206 in test cohort), 54 benign breast diseases serums in test cohort, 2836 non-cancer control serums (1493 in training cohort, 1343 in test cohort), 514 non-breast benign diseases serums in training cohort. 150 of the non-cancer control serums in training cohort and 412 of the non-breast benign diseases serums in training cohort have been uploaded previously and are avaialable under GSE59856 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59856 ).
