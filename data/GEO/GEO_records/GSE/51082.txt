TITLE
Expression data from mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of leukemia patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was conducted using a GeneChip® Human Genome U133(HG–U133A & B) array with more than 39,000 transcripts Cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors are known to play important roles in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and immune response in normal and cancer cells. Substantial evidence indicates that deregulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling contributes to leukemogenesis through aberrant activation of kinase-driven signaling pathways. In order to identify cytokine/growth factor receptors that are critical for leukemia cell growth, we established a novel functional RNAi-based screen targeting 188 non-kinase cytokine/growth factor receptors and associated proteins that are highly expressed in hematopoietic malignancies. In AML 46884 is missing for Set A and 103855 is missing for Set B and in T-ALL 52570 Set A is missing because of sample size limitation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was done using mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of 141 leukemia patient samples including AML (N=38), precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL; N=17), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL; N=13), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; N=41), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; N=22)), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; N=10).
