TITLE
Expression array analysis in patients with neuroaxonal injury in cerebral palsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have analysed a family with an autosomal recessive type of tetraplegic cerebral palsy with mental retardation, reduction of cerebral white matter, and atrophy of the cerebellum in an inbred sibship. Homozygosity mapping using SNPs was performed to identify the chromosomal locus for the disease. In the 14 Mb candidate region on chromosome 7q22, RNA expression profiling was used to select among the 203 genes in the area.

DESIGN
In order to select putative candidate genes from the linkage region in patients, mRNA expression arrays were used to study the transcripts in fibroblasts of probands (IV-1,3,4,5,6) and controls (IV-2,9 plus two independent controls (male and female)).
