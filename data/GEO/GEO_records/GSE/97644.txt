TITLE
Circulating Exosomal miRNA as a Biomarker for Age-Related Cognitive Decline and Decreased Hippocampal Volume

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neural imaging, genetics, and circulating biomarkers are being developed to differentiate normal aging from diseases that affect cognition. The blood based biomarkers, such as plasma exosome could provide a simple and relatively inexpensive means for tracking the progression of cognitive decline and effectiveness of treatments, as well as providing information on mechanism for cognitive impairment.

DESIGN
The study included 97 human subjects, males (n = 58) and females (n = 39) (age range 44-102 years, average 73 years). Plasma exosomal miRNA was used to investigate the expression level associated with cognitive decline.
