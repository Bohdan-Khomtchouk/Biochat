TITLE
Designed Oligooxopiperazines as Modulators of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of oligooxopiperazines (OPs) targeting the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor complex.  Treatment of cells with OPs inhibited hypoxia-inducible gene expression in A549 cells.

DESIGN
Hypoxic A549 cells were treated with transcriptional inhibitors BB2-162, BB2-125, BB2-282 or vehicle and their expression profiles were compared to normoxic A549 cells treated with vehicle.
