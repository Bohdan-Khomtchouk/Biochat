TITLE
Heterozygous carriers of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome Have a Distinct Gene Expression Phenotype.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By comparing the expression levels of genes between carriers of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome and non-carriers, we showed that NBS carriers have a distinct gene expression phenotype. Keywords: Cell Line Comparison

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Human Focus arrays; comparison of expression levels of genes using t-statistic and identification of genes that allow classification of individuals as carriers or non-carriers by linear discriminant analysis.
