TITLE
Gene expression induced by blue light stimulation to oyster mushroom mycelia

ORGANISM
Pleurotus ostreatus

SUMMARY
Photoresponse mechanism of oyster muchroom mycelia was studied using a custom microarray prepared on the basis of the genome information (Pleurotus ostreatus PC15 v2.0) in JGI Genome Portal. Blue light stimulation to the mycelia caused the up-regulation and down-regulation of genes expression. Particulary, the genes coding rate-controlling enzymes in glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and sikimic acid pathways were up-regulated to accumulate shikimic acid dramatically.

DESIGN
In this study, the time course of gene expression in oyster mushroom mycelia caused by blue light stimulation using light emitting diodes (LED) was analyzed at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 h.
