TITLE
The target genes of EGFR activity in glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a first step towards identifying the target genes of EGFR activity in glioma cells, genome-wide expression analyses were performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A array. To accomplish this, mRNA expression levels of these genes were measured in the glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and U178, engineered with EGFR by retrovirus transduction (termed U87-EGFR and U178-EGFR respectively), with or without 20 ng/mL EGF treatment for 3 h.

DESIGN
U87 and U178 cells engineered to express EGFR were stimulated with or without  EGF. The experiment was replicated twice for each U87 and U178 cells.
