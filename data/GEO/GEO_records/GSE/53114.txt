TITLE
An improved, low-cost, hydroponic system for growing Arabidopsis and other model plant species under sterility conditions (Arabidopsis transcriptional profile in early response to Pi starvation)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of roots from 12 days-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings transfered to Pi-deficient medium in hydroponic solution in a 10 min, 30 min, and 2 hrs time course period.

DESIGN
A dye balanced modified loop design was implemented. This experiment involved a total of twelve sets of microarray hybridizations, including direct and dye swap comparisons between treatments as well as across time points for the same treatment. This design allowed us to determine differences in gene expression between Pi-deprived and control seedlings, and whether the differences were time dependent. Four biological replicates representing each sampling point were obtained.
