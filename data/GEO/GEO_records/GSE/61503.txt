TITLE
Identification and expression profiling of Helicoverpa armigera microRNAs and their possible role in the regulation of digestive protease genes

ORGANISM
Helicoverpa armigera

SUMMARY
Using Illumina platform, deep sequencing of 12 small RNA libraries was performed from Helicoverpa armigera larvae fed on artificial diet (AD) or recombinant Capsicum annuum PI-7 (rCanPI-7) incorporated diet at various time intervals (0.5, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48h). Several candidate miRNAs (conserved and novel) were differentially expressed in rCanPI-7 fed larvae as compared to the larvae fed on AD. The investigation revealed potential roles of miRNAs in H. armigera protease gene regulation.

DESIGN
miRNA expression analysed in H. armigera larvae in response to PI ingestion

PLATFORM
GPL19203 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Helicoverpa armigera)
