TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of PBMCs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of miRNAs in the etiology of idiopathic PD, we conducted global miRNA expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the PBMCs of 19 PD patients and 13 controls, labeled and hybridized to Exiqon microarrays spotted with probes for 733 human miRNAs.
