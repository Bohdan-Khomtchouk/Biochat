TITLE
Reading between the lines: molecular characterization of five widely used canine  lymphoid tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Molecular characterization of tumour cell lines is increasingly regarded as a prerequisite for defining  their validity as models of in vivo neoplasia. We present the first comprehensive catalogue of  genomic and transcriptional characteristics of five widely used canine lymphoid tumour cell lines.  High-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization defined their unique profiles  of genomic DNA copy number imbalance. Multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization identified  aberrant gains of MYC, KIT and FLT3 and deletions of PTEN and CDKN2 in individual cell lines, and also  revealed examples of extensive structural chromosome reorganization. Gene expression profiling  and RT-PCR analyses defined the relationship between genomic imbalance and transcriptional  dysregulation in each cell line, clarifying their relevance as models of discrete functional pathways  with biological and therapeutic significance. In combination, these data provide an extensive  resource of molecular data for directing the appropriate use of these cell lines as tools for studying  canine lymphoid neoplasia. GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 array (Affymetrix) which is comprised of 18,000 Canis familiaris mRNA transcripts and over 20,000 non-redundant predicted genes was used

DESIGN
5 widely used canine lymphoid cell lines underwent immunophenotypic, genomic, and transcriptome characterization
