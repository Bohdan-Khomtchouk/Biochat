TITLE
Characterization of Nicotiana attenuata stems with reduced expression of calcium dependent protein kinase 4/5 (ir-CDPK4/5 plants).

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of calcium dependent protein kinase 4/5 compared to WT.

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-CDPK4/5 stems was measured at an age of 41 days.Three independent experiments were performed with ir-CDPk4/5 plants.

PLATFORM
