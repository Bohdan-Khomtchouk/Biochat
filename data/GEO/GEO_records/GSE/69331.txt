TITLE
Genome-wide binding data for TRIM24 in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a novel and important role for the TRIM24-dependent transcriptional program in promoting prostate cancer progression to a castration-resistant state.

DESIGN
Examination of TRIM24 binding in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. More specifically, we determine binding in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells stimulated for 4h with vehicle (ETOH) or 10nM DHT, and in castration-resistant LNCaP-abl cells grown under vehicle conditions.
