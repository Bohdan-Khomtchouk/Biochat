TITLE
RNAseq analysis of NR0B1 LOF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report analysis of transcriptional chanages following RNAi depletion of NR0B1 or NRF2 depletion in NSCLC cell lines as determined by RNAseq. Additionally we also determine the genomic location of NR0B1 in NSCLC lines by Chip-Seq.

DESIGN
Evaulation of RNAseq following NR0B1 depeltion in one cell line and NRF2 depletion in two cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens) GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
