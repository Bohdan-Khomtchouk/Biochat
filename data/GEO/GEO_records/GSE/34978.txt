TITLE
Formaldehyde and Epigenetic Alterations: MicroRNA Changes in the Nasal Epithelium of Nonhuman Primates

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
We set out to test the hypothesis that formaldehyde inhalation exposure significantly alters miRNA expression profiles within the nasal epithelium of nonhuman primates. Here, cynomolgus macaques were exposed to 0, 2, and 6 ppm formaldehyde for 6 hours/day across two consecutive days. RNA was extracted from the nasal maxilloturbinate region, a direct target of formaldehyde inhalation exposure. Genome-wide miRNA expression levels were assessed using microarrays.

DESIGN
Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to 0, 2 and 6 ppm formaldehyde for 6 hours/day across two consecutive days using whole body exposure chambers. RNA was extracted from the nasal maxilloturbinate region, a direct target of formaldehyde inhalation exposure. Genome-wide miRNA expression levels were assessed using microarrays.
