TITLE
Identification of genes differentailly expressed in cancer stem-like cells of ovarian serous carcinoma and its clinical significance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found gene expression profiling of spheroid-forming cell (cancer stem-like cell) by cDNA microarray and validated the genes as prognostic markers of ovarian serous carcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from four different spheroid-forming cell (S3, S4, S5, and sample 7) compared to corresponding parent cancer cell (control3-1, C4, C5 and control7) by cDNA microarray.
