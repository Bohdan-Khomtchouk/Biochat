TITLE
Comparison of gene expression after induction of DNA endonuclease in strains either containing a cut site or not

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Investigating the induction of the SOS response after the introduction of a single dsDNA break per genome by expressing the SceI endonuclease. The endonuclease is under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter.
