TITLE
Comparison of gene expression after induction of DNA endonuclease in strains either containing a cut site or not

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Investigating the induction of the SOS response after the introduction of a single dsDNA break per genome by expressing the SceI endonuclease. The endonuclease is under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter.

DESIGN
Grow cells from 2 strains (LAS210, which has an SceI cut site, and LAS195, which does not) in minimal arabinose and at T0 both strains get xylose to induce the endonuclease. In one strain the endonuclease does not produce cuts, however. Each set is done in triplicate.
