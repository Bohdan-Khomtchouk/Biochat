TITLE
Histone H3 Lysine4 Acetylation-Methylation Dynamics Define Breast Cancer Subtypes [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular signature at histone H3K4 involved in epigenetic regulation of normal (MCF10A) and transformed (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) breast cells using ChIP-Seq technology.  This study examines the dynamic distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K4ac histone modification associated with active chromatin to provide an understanding of the changes in epigenetic regulation associated with the unique breast cancer subtypes.

DESIGN
H3K4me3 and H3K4ac histone modification study in normal (MCF10A) and transformed (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) breast cells using ChIP-Seq technology

PLATFORM
