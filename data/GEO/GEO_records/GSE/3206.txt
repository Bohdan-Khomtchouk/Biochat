TITLE
Homeostatic Adjustment and Metabolic Remodeling in Glucose-limited Yeast Cultures Time Course 2

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Time course of batch growth.  Reference (channel 1) was a culture grown in MD medium with 2.4 g/L glucose,  with 5 slpm air-flow, stirring at 400 rpm and a constant 300C temperature, dilution 0.25 volumes/hour.  The experimental (channel 2) samples were grown in batch for the indicated time. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series.
