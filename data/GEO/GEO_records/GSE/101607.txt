TITLE
Whole genome expression analysis of clinical bone metastasis samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA from clinical bone metastasis samples were analyzed using whole genome expression bead arrays and the Illumina platform with the objective to identify molecular subgroups of potential clinical relevance.

DESIGN
Fresh-frozen bone metastasis samples from men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, n = 40), untreated prostate cancer (n = 8) or other malignancies (n = 12) were characterized using whole-genome expression profiling followed by multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) and functional enrichment analysis. The CRPC samples were defined as androgen receptor (AR) driven or non-AR driven based on expression of AR and AR-regulated genes (AR activity), please see Ylitalo et al, Eur Urol. 2017 May;71(5):776-787 (PMID 27497761) for further description.
