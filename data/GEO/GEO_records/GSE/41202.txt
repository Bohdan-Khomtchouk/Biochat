TITLE
Comparisons of transcriptome among several human iPSC clones derived from different origin and different donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetically matched human iPSCs from different origins were generated using bone marrow stromal cells and dermal fibroblasts of the same donor, and the global gene expression profile were analyzed.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expressions among 14 iPS clones, 4 and 4 were derived from bone marrow stromal cells(BM), 2 and 4 were from dermal skin fibroblasts(SF) of donor90 and 91, respectively.
