TITLE
Epistasis analysis of Runx1 and Gata1 over HoxA3 in hemogenic endothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observe that HoxA3 represses hematopoieis by the repression of several transcription factors including Runx1 and Gata1. Up regulation of either Runx1 or Gata1 in the presence of HoxA3 reverted the hematopoietic repression. We have performed full genome analysis to determine the molecular signature of hematopoietic development in response to upregulation of Runx1 and Gata1.

DESIGN
Endothelial progenitors were sorted from HoxA3 induced EBs, transduced with either control vector (control), Runx1 vector or Gata1 vector. Cells were co-cultured on Op9 for 5 days: in the following conditions: Control, HoxA3 upregulation, HoxA3 + Runx1 upregulation, HoxA3 + Gata1 upregulation in triplicate. After 5 days of culture,transduced cells were sorted (5000 cells) and prepared for microarray.
