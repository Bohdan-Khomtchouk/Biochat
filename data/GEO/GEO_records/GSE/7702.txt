TITLE
Comparison of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and its androgen insensitive derivative C4-2B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LNCaP and its androgen insensitive derivative were profiled in order to identify genes differentially expressed during the conversion to androgen insensitivity. This experiment was performed due to the presence of an ins(7;14) localizing the entire ETV1 locus to chr 14 in LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
LNCaP and C4-2B were both hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligonucleotide Microarrays, with a commercially obtained pool of benign prostate RNA serving as the reference for both cell lines. Dye flips for both cell lines were also performed

PLATFORM
