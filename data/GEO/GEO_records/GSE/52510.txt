TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in human monocyte devried DCs. By obtaining about 15 million mapped reads for each sample from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different histone modifications, H3K4me3/H3K27ac/H3K27me3, in 2 cell types,human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
