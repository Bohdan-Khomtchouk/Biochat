TITLE
Candidate driver genes in Sѐzary syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina human Omni5Exome arrays were used to investigate CNVs in Sѐzary syndrome tumours as part of a larger study involving whole exome sequencing of the same samples and targeted resequencing of a further cohort.

DESIGN
16 Samples underwent SNP array including 10 tumour/gDNA matched samples that also underwent whole exome sequencing, public databases were used as further control data for calling CNVs.
