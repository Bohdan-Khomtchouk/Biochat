TITLE
Gene expression alteration by macrophage depletion in IKKα mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated Ikkα-KA/KA knock-in mice (KA/KA), in which an ATP binding site of Ikkα Lys 44 was replaced by alanine. The knock-in mice develop severe skin lesions and begin to die after 6 to 10 months. We also found lung SCCs in some of the mice. To study lung SCC development, we stabilize the skin condition by crossing  KA/KA with Lori.Ikkα transgenic mice to generate KA/KA-Lori.Ikkα mice, which 100% spontaneously developed lethal lung SCC at 4 to 6 months of age. Clodronate-liposomes obtained from Dr. N. van Rooijen (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were intravenously injected into mice twice every week, started in 4 weeks old mice, and continued for 3 months. The dose of clodronate-liposomes was 100µl during the first month and elevated to 150 100µl after that. The depletion efficacy was confirmed by detecting pulmonary macrophages with Flow Cytometry. Depletion of macrophages in these KA/KA-Lori.Ikkα mice could significantly reduce inflammation and prevent lung SCC developmrnt. This aim of this microarray assay is to identify differentially expressed genes among Wild type, KA/KA-Lori.Ikkα, and macophage-depleted KA/KA-Lori.Ikkα mice, which may highlight the important genes or parthways involved in inflammation-associated lung SCC carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Three samples were analyzed: 1. WT (lung tissue from wild type mouse); 2. KA2 (mixture tissue of lung SCC and tumor neighbor from KA/KA-Lori-Ikkα mouse ); 3. KAT (lung tissue from KA/KA-Lori-Ikkα mouse with macrophage depletion treatment)
