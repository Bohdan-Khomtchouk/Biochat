TITLE
No evidence for a C. elegans small RNA response to feeding with OxyS-expressing bacteria

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequencing shows that there are no Caenorhabditis elegans endo siRNAs made against the OxyS non-coding RNA.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNAs from C. elegans fed bacteria overexpressing the non-coding RNA OxyS, control samples fed either standard E. coli or one without the OxyS RNA, an rde-4 deletion mutant deficient in endo siRNA production and the OxyS-overexpressing bacteria itself. 5' independent samples were treated with the enzyme RNA 5' polyphosphatase to remove 5'  triphosphate; 5' dependent samples were not treated with 5' polyphosphatase.
