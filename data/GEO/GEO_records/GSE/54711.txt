TITLE
Parent vs. Induced drug tolerant cells Microarray Analysis

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
WM164 BRAF mutant Melanoma cells were treated with 500nM PLX4032 for 16 days and their gene expression was compared to parent cells kept in DMSO.

DESIGN
WM164 treated and untreated cells were kept in triplicate and the mRNA from individual samples were isolated independently for analysis.

PLATFORM
