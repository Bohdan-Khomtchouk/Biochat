TITLE
Gene expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines upon TGFb-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been implicated in tumor metasisi, cancer drug resistance and cancer stem cell features.  In this study, we examined gene expression profiles of three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, before and after experimentally induced EMT.

DESIGN
We modeled epitheial-mesenchyml transition by culturing A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358 cells in the presence of TGFb for three weeks, and compared gene expression profiles of the paretnal cells and cells after EMT.
