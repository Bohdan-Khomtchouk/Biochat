TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of WNT (Tcf7l2) and BMP (SMAD1) in human hematopoeitic cell lines co-occupied with lineage specific regulators (GATA1, GATA2, CEBPA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lineage regulators direct BMP and Wnt pathways to cell-specific programs during differentiation and regeneration. This represents the human ChIP-seq portion of this dataset on leukemia cell lines.

DESIGN
Human hematopoietic cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total Smad1 (Santa Cruz SC-7965), Tcf7l2 (Santa Cruz SC-8631),Gata1 (Santa Cruz SC-265),  Gata2 (Santa Cruz SC-9008), CEBPA (SC-9314) or H3K4me1 (Abcam ab8895).
