TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of transcriptome and translatome following eIF4A1 knockdown in MCF7 cells [Array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify which genes were regulated by mRNA helicase activity, the effect of eIF4A1 knockdown on the MCF7 cell transcriptome and translatome was determined. eIF4A1-dependent mRNAs were highly enriched for several classes of genes with oncogenic potential, which leads to a model whereby dysregulation of mRNA unwinding contribues to the malignant phenotype in breast cancer cells via preferential translation of a subset of genes.

DESIGN
Total, subpolysomal and polysomal RNA was isolated from MCF7 cells treated with either control siRNAs or siRNAs directed against eIF4A1 (48h post-transfection).
