TITLE
Human Renal Cancer Cells: Control vs STF-62247-treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of Renal Cancer Cells (RCC) in response to a small molecule, STF-62247. These microarrays have been used to compared with proteomic profiling data in the paper entitled Quantitative proteomics to study a small molecule targeting the loss of VHL in Renal Cell Carcinomas

DESIGN
Two condition experiments, one cell line (RCC4), untreated control and STF-62247-treated. Biological triplicates N=3, indendently grown and harvested. Cells were treated with 1.25uM STF-62247 or vehicle (DMSO) for 48h. Oligo microarrays done in triplicate dye swaps for a total of 6 slides.

PLATFORM
GPL22358 ACRI Human2 oligo array
