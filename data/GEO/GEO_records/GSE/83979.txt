TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of cardiac H3K9me2 levels in response to ischemic preconditioning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K9me2 ChIP-Seq of cardiac biopsies from the area at risk and remote myocardium of mice subjected to ischemic preconditioning.

DESIGN
Mice were subjected to ischemic preconditioning (IPC) through reversible ligation of the left coronary artery or a sham procedure. The procedure consisted of 5 minutes of ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion, repeated 4 times and then followed by a 30 minute reperfusion period. Biopsies were taken from the area at risk (AAR) and remote myocardium (RM) from six IPC mice
