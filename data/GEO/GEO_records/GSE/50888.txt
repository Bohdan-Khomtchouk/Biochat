TITLE
HMLEN cells with Vector Control vs SNAIL vs SNAIL/FBXO11

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse HMLEN breast cancer cells (HMLE cells transformed with -Neu oncogene) stably tranduced with pLEX-MCS based lentivirus. Three groups were compared, Vector cells, SNAIL expressing cells; and SNAIL+FBXO11 expressing cells. SNAIL expression induced strong EMT phenotype while SNAIL/FBXO11 reversed cells back to epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiments Vector vs SNAIL vs SNAIL/FBXO11.  Two replicates per each condition.
