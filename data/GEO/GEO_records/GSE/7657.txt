TITLE
Identification of phase-specific arthritis-related genes in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), one of the most common polygenic diseases, is characterized by a chronic, progressive inflammation mainly in joints and has an unknown etiology. Numerous studies have revealed the significance of cytokines TNF and IL-1 in the onset and progression of RA. Due to the complexity of interactions among different cytokines and immune cells, little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying RA. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis and a mouse model of RA, IL-1 receptor antagonist deficient mice were used to address this issue. Two hundred and ninety transcripts were found to be dysregulated greater than or equal to 2-fold in the diseased mice. Phase-specific gene expression changes were identified, including early increase and late decrease of heat shock protein coding genes and Cyr61. Moreover, common gene expression changes were also observed, especially the upregulation of paired-Ig-like receptor A (Pira) in both early and late phases of arthritis. We conclude that common and distinct gene expression change patterns that were identified globally may represent novel opportunities for better control of RA through early diagnosis and development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Six wild-type and 6 Il1rn deficient BALB/c mice at 1 month and 4 month (3 for each time point) were used for microarray analysis of splenic gene expression profiling.
