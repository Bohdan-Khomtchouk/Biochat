TITLE
Gene expression and cell cycle arrest in a rat keratinocyte cell line exposed to 56 Fe Ions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of the present work was to examine gene expression patterns in a rat keratinocyte line exposed to a 56Fe ion beam Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
The cells were exposed to 1.01 geV/nucleon 56Fe ions generated by the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory facility. Data from Affymetrix rat microarrays (RAT 230_2) were processed by BRB ArrayTools 3.3.0 software, and the Gene Ontogeny (GO) database was utilized to categorize significantly responding genes.
