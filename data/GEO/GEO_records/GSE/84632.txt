TITLE
Gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adults with sickle cell disease (UIC cohort)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease is associated with systemic complications, many associated with either severity of disease or increased risk of mortality. We sought to identify a circulating gene expression profile whose predictive capacity spanned the spectrum of these poor outcomes in sickle cell disease. The Training cohort consisted of patients with SCD who were prospectively recruited from the University of Illinois. The Testing cohort consisted of a combination of patients prospectively seen at two separate institutions including the University of Chicago and Howard University

DESIGN
The gene expression of PBMC from 172 sickle cell disease patients at UIC were analyzed
