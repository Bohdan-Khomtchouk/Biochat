TITLE
GPS2 cistrome analysis in BMDMs and RAW264.7 cells and epigenome comparison between WT and GPS2-knockout BMDMs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GPS2 binding sites in BMDMs can be localized specially in enhancers (H3K27ac) and promoters (H3K27ac, H3K4me3). Upon GPS2 knock-out in BMDMs, de-repression of certain inflammatory genes occur, as accompanied by increased recruitment of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks.

DESIGN
GPS2 cistrome was analyzed in WT and GPS2-KO BMDMs in basal conditions, and also in RAW264.7 macrophage cell line, using different home raised antibodies for GPS2. Also the epigenomic status of GPS2-KO vs WT BMDMs was analyzed using the histone markers H3K4me3 and H3K27ac.
