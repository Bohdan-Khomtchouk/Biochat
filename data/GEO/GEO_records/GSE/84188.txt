TITLE
Ebolavirus species associated with differential pathogenicity induce distinct host responses in human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Highly pathogenic Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection is associated with a dysregulated immune response and high levels of cytokines and chemokines are observed in fatal human cases. . In stark contrast Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) might be non-pathogenic for humans yet the underlying mechanisms determining pathogenicity for different Ebola viruses are not understood. In this study we investigate antiviral immune responses in EBOV- and RESTV- infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We provide evidence that increased pathogenicity of the highly pathogenic EBOV is associated with a strong activation of host responses from infected MDM. The observed cytokine response after EBOV infection is strikingly similar to LPS-mediated immune signatures however EBOV caused significant induction of the interferon response in addition. In contrast we show that the low pathogenic RESTV fails to elicit significant immune responses in infected MDM. These results demonstrate a correlation of pathogenicity and excessive MDM activation for different Ebola virus species. Interaction of the viral glycoprotein (GP) with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) leading to activation of NF_B signaling is responsible for this effect rather than differences in replication or blocking of immune signaling. We demonstrate that inhibition of TLR4 is able to abolish EBOV-GP mediated NF_B activation which might offer the possibility to develop targeted treatments for EBOV limiting the extreme immune response that seems to be detrimental to the host.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from primary cultured human macrophages (n=3 donors) that were either mock-infected, infected with Ebola virus (Kikwit-95) or Reston virus (Pennsylvania), or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
