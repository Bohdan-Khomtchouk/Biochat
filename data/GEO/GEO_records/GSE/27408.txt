TITLE
Transcriptional response of an azole-resistant Candida parapsilosis isolate [voriconazole].

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Azole resistance was induced in vitro by growth of a susceptible C. parapsilosis isolate in the presence of voriconazole. Whole genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional response of the voriconizole-resistant and susceptible isolates.
