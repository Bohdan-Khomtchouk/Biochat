TITLE
ATAC-seq analysis of the chromatin landscape during in vitro differentiation of murine trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to survey changes in chromatin accessibility during early trophoblast differentiation and assess its releationship with transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq was performed on 75,000 cells of two independent wild type trophoblast stem cell lines after 0 and 48 hours of in vitro differentiation.
