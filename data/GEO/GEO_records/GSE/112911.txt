TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Differential Responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and  PA14 cells to Interfacial Stress

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression level of P. aeruginosa confined to Hexadecane-water interfaces. The hypothesis tested in the present study was to determine if interfacial confinements at hexadecane-water affect microbial metabolism through regulation of stress response.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated PAO1 and PA14 cells subjected to 1 hour of confinement at Hexadecane-water interfaces. The Total expression level was compared to the untreated control (exposed for 1 hour  to 154 mM NaCl solution only).

PLATFORM
GPL18782 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1) GPL21807 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14)
