TITLE
Transcriptomics Analyses of soybean leaves and roots sample during water-deficit

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were performed on the roots and leaves samples seperately using custom based Nimblgen platform (12plex). This is a time-course study. The plants were grown in controlled growth chamber condiditons ambiient to soybean growth and development using a hydrophonics system. The tissues were harvested after 30days of growth in six time points- 0min, 30mins, 1hour, 2hours, 3hours and 5hours of dehydration.

DESIGN
We used a hydrophonics system for the trancriptomics analysis of the soybean(William -82) root and leaves samples to study the reponse during water- deficit or drought. Plants were grown in controlled growth chamber conditions and harvested after 30days in six time-points. The plants were transferred to empty pots without touching to nullify any possibility of wounding and harvested subsequently. For 0mins, plants were taken out of the well-watered conditions and transfered to empty boxes and immediately harvested for both tisses and hence called 0-min dehydrated tissue. Similarly other time-points were processed (for instance, 2hrs of dehydration, plants were dehydrated for 2hours after being taken out from well-waterted pots and then harvested). Tissues for three biological replicates and three plants per biological replicates were collected for each time-point (n=9). RNA was islolated from both tissues using RNeasy Kit from Qiagen and quality was accessed with Nano-drop as well as with Agilent-Bioanalyzer using RNA-600 kit. 20ug of sample was processed at Micro Array Facility.
