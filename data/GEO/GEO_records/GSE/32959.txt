TITLE
An integrative computational systems biology approach identifies differentially regulated dynamic transcriptome signatures which drive the initiation of human T helper cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this dataset was to study in detail the transcription kinetics initiated by cytokines IL-12 and IL-4 in early differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from activated and IL-12 or IL-4 & anti-IL-12 treated cord blood CD4+ T cells, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of the cultures, compared to cells which were only activated. 37 samples were analyzed from three biological replicates of the culture. Several (26) of the Samples in this Series represent a re-analysis of CEL files originally submitted as GEO Series GSE17974. Please see associations on each Sample record.
