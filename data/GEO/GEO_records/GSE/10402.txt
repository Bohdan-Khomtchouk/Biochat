TITLE
A 50-Gene Predictor of Recurrence as a Guide to Therapy in Early-Stage Colon Cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles reflect unique aspects of individual biologic phenotypes and may characterize the heterogeneity of solid tumors. Using previously-described methodologies that employ DNA microarray data, a 50-gene expression profile (metagene) that predicts risk of recurrence in early stage colon carcinoma was identified. This analysis used an initial discovery cohort of 52 patients. The performance of the 50-gene predictor was evaluated in an independent validation cohort of 73 patients. Using a connectivity map analysis of the 50-gene model, we identified candidate agents and then tested the in vitro efficacy of these compounds in colon cancer cell lines. 73 samples that had patient recurrence data with stage information were used in the analysis. Keywords: Disease state analysis
