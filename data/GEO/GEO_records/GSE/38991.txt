TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation maps of Arabidopsis thaliana in two seasons

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is involved in many biological processes during plant growth and development. Here, we report a novel annual growth rhythm that is found in cotton plants grown in different time-of-year. To further study this rhythm in other plants, we use Arabidopsis thaliana for genome-wide bisulfite sequencing.

DESIGN
Two A. thaliana DNA samples were extracted from 20 days old whole plant in Feburary and August for bisulphite treatment and further Illumina sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
