TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in cardiac macrophages from P1 or P14 mice 3 days following MI

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to cardiomyocyte death, which triggers an immune response that clears  debris and restores tissue integrity. In the adult heart, the immune system facilitates scar formation, which  repairs the damaged myocardium but compromises cardiac function. In neonatal mice, the heart can regenerate  fully without scarring following MI; however, this regenerative capacity is lost by P7. The signals that  govern neonatal heart regeneration are unknown. By comparing the immune response to MI in mice at P1  and P14, we identified differences in the magnitude and kinetics of monocyte and macrophage responses to  injury. Using a cell-depletion model, we determined that heart regeneration and neoangiogenesis following MI  depends on neonatal macrophages. Neonates depleted of macrophages were unable to regenerate myocardia  and formed fibrotic scars, resulting in reduced cardiac function and angiogenesis. Immunophenotyping and  gene expression profiling of cardiac macrophages from regenerating and nonregenerating hearts indicated  that regenerative macrophages have a unique polarization phenotype and secrete numerous soluble factors  that may facilitate the formation of new myocardium. Our findings suggest that macrophages provide necessary  signals to drive angiogenesis and regeneration of the neonatal mouse heart. Modulating inflammation  may provide a key therapeutic strategy to support heart regeneration.
