TITLE
A timecourse analysis of the genetic extinction of NRAS in an inducible mouse model of melanoma.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to understand the pathways involved in NRAS extinction over time using a doxycycline-dependent, inducible mouse model of melanoma. This data provides insights into the temporal dynamics of downstream NRAS signaling and helps to correlate differentially affected pathways. We used microarrays to determine which transcripts were affected by NRAS-Q61K extinction at 24, 48, and 72 hours after doxycycline withdrawal. This data was used in support of a separate dataset submitted to GEO entitled Comparison of the genetic extinction of NRAS to pharmacological MEK inhibition in an inducible mouse model of melanoma.

DESIGN
The iNRAS-475 mouse melanoma cell line was injected intradermally into nude mice which were fed 2mg/ml doxycycline water. Tumors were allowed to reach 200-500mm3 after 6 weeks. Doxycyline was then withdrawn from the diet and tumors harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-withdrawal.
