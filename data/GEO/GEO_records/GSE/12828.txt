TITLE
Expression profiles of human carotid plaques

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This analysis compares gene expression in human carotid plaques with gene expression in major tissues and cell types in the human body (GSE1133, Su et al. 2004).

DESIGN
Human carotid endarterectomies were isolated from six subjects with symptomatic carotid artery disease.
