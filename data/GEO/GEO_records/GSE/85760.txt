TITLE
Genome-wide primary transcriptome landscape reveals the diversity of regulatory elements in archaeal genomes

ORGANISM
Thermococcus onnurineus

SUMMARY
We show the transcriptomic landscape of the H2-producing archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 in response to different growth conditions using primary and whole transcriptome sequencing. We identified 1,082 purine-rich transcription initiation sites along with well-conserved TATA boxes, A-rich B recognition elements (BREs), and promoter proximal element (PPE) motifs in promoter regions, a high pyrimidine nucleotide content (T/C) at the âˆ’1 position, and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motifs (GGDGRD) in 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs). In addition, along with differential transcript levels, 117 leaderless genes and 86 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were identified, representing diverse cellular functions and potential regulatory functions during hydrogen production. Further comparative analysis of T. onnurineus upstream regulatory sequences with those of closely related archaeal genomes demonstrated that orthologous genes are expressed from highly conserved promoter sequences, however their upstream sequences for transcriptional and translational regulation are largely diverse. This study suggests that closely related archaea maintain orthologous gene functions, but may diversify the elements that regulate them to adapt to their unique environmental habitats.

DESIGN
Profiles of primary transcripts and whole transcripts of Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Miseq and Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx.
