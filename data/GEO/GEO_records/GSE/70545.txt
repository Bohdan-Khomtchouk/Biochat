TITLE
Foxd3 promotes the exit from naïve pluripotency and prevents germline specification through enhancer decommissioning [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following implantation, mouse epiblast cells transit from a naïve to a primed state in which they are competent for both somatic and primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) as an in vitro model to study the transcriptional regulatory principles orchestrating peri-implantation development, here we show that the transcription factor Foxd3 is necessary for the exit from naïve pluripotency and the progression to a primed pluripotent state. During this transition, Foxd3 acts as a repressor that dismantles a significant fraction of the naïve pluripotency expression program through the decommissioning of active enhancers associated with key naïve pluripotency and early germline genes. Subsequently, Foxd3 needs to be silenced in primed pluripotent cells to allow the reactivation of relevant genes required for proper PGC specification. Our findings uncover a wave of activation-deactivation of Foxd3 as a crucial step for the exit from naïve pluripotency and subsequent PGC specification.

DESIGN
Genome-wide binding profiles for Foxd3 were investigated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). A mESC line (FH-Foxd3 mESC line) expressing exogenous Foxd3 tagged with Flag and HA epitope (FH-Foxd3) at nearly endogenous levels was generated. ChIPs were performed against FH-Foxd3 using anti-HA or anti-Flag antibodies.
