TITLE
Identification of Drosophila Mid regulated genes in embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila midline(mid), encodes a T-box transcription factor that is required for cell fate specification and tissue morphogenesis during a series of developmental processes. However, little is known about the target of Mid. To identify the Mid regulated genes, we compared expression profiles of mRNA purified from wild-type and mid mutant embryos. Summary file is yw-mid.CHP.

DESIGN
yw and mid mutant embryos were selected at later stage of development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We identified mid mutant embryos using CyOact-GFP balancer chromosome.
