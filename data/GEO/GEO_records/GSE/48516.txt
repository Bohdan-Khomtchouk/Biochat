TITLE
ChIP-seq in MEG3+ and MEG3- hIPSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this experiment we sought to identify region with differential PRC2, JARID2, and H3K27me3 occupancy in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines with silenced or expressed MEG3 locus to indirectly determine the effect of this ncRNA on PRC2 function.

DESIGN
8 hIPSC lines, 5 MEG3+ and 3 MEG3-; ChIP-seq for EZH2, JARID2, and H3K27me3. Some done in replicates.

PLATFORM
