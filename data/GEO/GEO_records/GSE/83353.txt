TITLE
Feasibility of unbiased RNA profiling of colorectal tumors: a proof of principle.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liquid biopsy profile which can screen for early CRC. We aimed to depict the profile of early stage CRC as well as for advanced adenomas by combination of current molecular knowledge with microarray technology, using efficient circulating free RNA purification from blood and RNA amplification technologies. Circulating free RNA profile of plasma from colorectal cancer patients, advanced adenomas and healthy colonoscopia subjects.

DESIGN
Plasma was drawn from 3 healthy colonoscopia subjects, 4 adanced adenomas subjects and 3 colorectal cancer patients. Circulating free RNA was purified from plasma samples and applied on GeneChip human 1.0 ST Arrays. The 'HuGene_1_0_green_yelow_red_DATASET.xlsx' and 'probe_level_expression_matrix.txt' files contain the primary data that was used to draw the conclusions of the current study.  Please note that exon-level' analysis was performed but NO probe summarization to probeset was performed, therefore both data matrices contains non-unique identifiers.
