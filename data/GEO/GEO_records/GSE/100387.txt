TITLE
Pervasive epistasis modulates neurodevelopmental defects in a Drosophila model of 16p11.2 deletion

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Rare CNVs such as the 16p11.2 deletion are associated with extensive phenotypic heterogeneity, complicating disease gene discovery and functional evaluation. We used RNA interference in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the phenotype, function, and interactions of conserved 16p11.2 homologs in a tissue-specific manner. Using a series of quantitative methods for assessing developmental and neuronal phenotypes, we identified multiple homologs that were sensitive to dosage and showed defects in cell proliferation, including KCTD13, MAPK3, and PPP4C. Leveraging the Drosophila eye for studying gene interactions, we performed 561 pairwise knockdowns of gene expression, and identified 24 interactions between 16p11.2 homologs (such as MAPK3 and CORO1A, and KCTD13 and ALDOA) and 62 interactions with other neurodevelopmental genes (such as MAPK3 and PTEN, and KCTD13 and RAF1) that significantly enhanced or suppressed cell proliferation phenotypes. Integration of fly interaction and transcriptome data into a human brain-specific genetic network allowed us to identify 982 novel interactions of 16p11.2 homologs, which were significantly enriched for cell proliferation genes (p=3.14Ã—10-12). Overall, these results point to a new model for pathogenicity of rare CNVs, where CNV genes interact with each other in conserved pathways to modulate expression of the neurodevelopmental phenotype.

DESIGN
mRNA-sequencing of Drosophila neuron-specific knockdown model heads for six 16p11.2 homologs and wild-type control. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 on three biological replicates per sample, with three technical replicates per biological replicate.

PLATFORM
