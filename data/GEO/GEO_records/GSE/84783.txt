TITLE
Therapeutic properties of Scutellaria baicalensis measured in genome-wide expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to measure expressional profile induced by temporal treatment with Scutellaria baicalensis in HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
Time-dependent expression of genes by treatment of Scutellaria baicalensis was measured on HepG2 cells. Total RNA  was isolated and was subject to single channnel microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
