TITLE
Expression data from third instar Drosophila larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Ectopic expression of DNMT3L in Drosophila causes melanotic tumor in the transgenic flies from fifth generation onwards. We used microaarray data analysis to look for the genes and pathways which are affected on ectopic expression of DNMT3L in Drosophila.

DESIGN
Drosophila third instar larvae were selected at particular stages of development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
