TITLE
Effect of anti-miR-33 treatment on gene expression in mouse macrophages from atherosclerotic plaques.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inhibition of miR-33 results in increased cholesterol efflux and HDL-cholesterol levels in mice. In this study we examined the effect of miR-33 inhibition in a mouse model of atherosclerosis and observed significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size. At the end of the study, gene expression in macrophages from the atherosclerotic plaques was assessed. The results demonstrated a reduction in inflammatory gene expression and increased levels of mRNAs containing miR-33 binding sites.

DESIGN
LDLR-/- mice on a Western diet with established atherosclerosis were switched to normal chow and treated with anti-miR-33, control anti-miR, or saline (n=4/group) for 4 weeks. Gene expression profiling was performed on macrophages in aortic plaques isolated at the end of the treatment period by laser capture microdissection.
