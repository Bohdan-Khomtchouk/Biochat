TITLE
Expression profiling of the Parkinsonian Brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix HG_U133 array sets (A and B chips) were used to determine the whole genome transcription profile of clinically documented and neuropathologically confirmed cases of sporadic Parkinson's disease as well as controls. Keywords: disease-state analysis

DESIGN
Post mortem brain tissue samples from Parkinson's disease and control cases (substantia nigra, split into medial and lateral portions, and frontal cortex) were prepared for this study. In total, 47 individual tissue samples were analyzed using one A and one B GeneChip per sample, i.e. 15 samples of medial parkinsonian SN, 9 samples of lateral parkinsonian SN, 8 medial nigra control samples and 7 lateral nigra control samples. Lateral and medial nigra samples were from the same cases. In addition, frontal cerebral cortex was analyzed in five of the PD cases and in three of the controls (Neurogenetics 2006 7: 1â€“11; Acta Neuropathologica (Berlin) 2007 113: 253-263
