TITLE
Expression data in human young and old primary keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1s (PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta) are transcriptional coactivators involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism, and antioxidant defense. Given the existing links between PGC-1s and aging, we wanted to investigate the contribution of PGC-1s to skin aging. Keratinocytes form a self-renewable layer that differentiate to generate full epidermis. Defects in keratinocyte metabolism related to aging or PGC-1s depletion could impair normal function of keratinocytes and contribute to skin thinning. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes shared by the aging process and the depletion in PGC-1s.

DESIGN
We selected a pair of primary keratinocytes from human donors that were matched for gender (male), ethnicity (caucasian) and body site (back skin). Young cells were from a 28 y.o. donor, aged cells were from a 83 y.o. (55-year difference). Cells were cultured using the same media and grown at similar cell densities. RNA were extracted from subconfluent cultures 3 days post-treatment (siRNA control or siRNA PGC-1alpha+PGC1beta). Each condition has 2 biological replicates.
