TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of Arid1a and C/ebpα in the mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arid1a is the subunit of SWI/SNF complex, which was reported to guide SWI/SNF to DNA. Here, we found that loss of Arid1a in the liver and other adult tissues results in improved organ regeneration. Within SWI/SNF complexes, Arid1a physically interacts with C/ebpα, a hepatocyte transcription factor that drives maturation and limits proliferation. Genome-wide analysis showed that loss of Arid1a reduces the recruitment and activity of C/ebpα on target promoters, resulting in expression programs that favor regeneration and cellular fitness during injury. Arid1a binding is enriched in promoters near transcriptional start sites (TSSs), and C/ebpα binds at precisely the same positions, indicating that Arid1a facilitates C/ebpα binding across the genome.

DESIGN
Perfuse and isolate primary hepatocytes from mice livers, analysis of genomic occupancy of C/ebpα and H3K4me2 in hepatocytes from Arid1a WT and Arid1a liver specific KO mice by ChIP-seq. Analysis of genomic occupancy of Arid1a in the hepatocytes from V5-Arid1a transgenic mouse by ChIP-seq.
