TITLE
Identification of KSHV RTA and K8 binding sites on viral genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the binding sites of KSHV encoded imemdiate early protein, RTA and early protein, K8 on KSHV genome by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and sequencing of the DNA bound to RTA and K8

DESIGN
KSHV infected, TRExBCBL1-RTA cells were induced with doxycycline for 24h to trigger the lytic reactivation, cells were crosslinked and subjected for chromatin isolation and sonication. ChIP assay was performed using purified antibodies for RTA and K8.
