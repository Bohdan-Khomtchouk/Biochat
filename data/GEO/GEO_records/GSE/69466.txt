ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify potential regeneration-associated genes, rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were lesioned and then sampled at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 148, or 296 hrs

DESIGN
A total of 23 samples were examined in 8 time points with 2-3 replicates each.  For each array, lesioned and uninjured DRG samples were run in a two-color experiment. ----------------------------------------------------- submitters of this record cannot locate the raw data
