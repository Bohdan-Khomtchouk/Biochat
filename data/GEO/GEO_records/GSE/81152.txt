TITLE
MicroRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for major depression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood samples taken from healthy controls and patients with major depression were analyzed for differences in microRNA expression.  Patients were treated with either electroconvulsive therapy or ketamine and samples were again analyzed to determine if these treatments affected microRNA expression.  Baseline microRNA expression profiles were studied to see if they could predict treatment response.

DESIGN
Heatly controls (19), MDD patients (31)
