TITLE
Human CD14+CD16- and CD16+ monocyte-derived macrophages primed by GM-CSF or M-CSF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes differentially expressed between human CD14+CD16- and CD16+ monocyte-derived macrophages generated in the presence of either GM-CSF (termed GM14 and GM16, respectively) or M-CSF (termed M14 and M16, respectively)

DESIGN
Human peripheral  CD14+CD16- and CD16+ blood monocytes from three independent healthy donors (D1, D2 and D3) were isolated by positive selection from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using magnetic separation systems (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, PBMC were first incubated with MACS anti-CD56 antibody conjugated to paramagnetic microbeads in order to eliminate the NK (CD16+) cell fraction. NK-depleted PBMC were further incubated with MACS anti-CD16 antibody to isolate CD16+ monocytes. CD56-CD16- PBMC were finally incubated with MACS anti-CD14 antibody to obtain the CD14+CD16- monocyte fraction. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days in medium containing either GM-CSF or M-CSF. Total RNA from each condition was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and hybridized to an Agilent Human Whole Genome (4x44) Oligo Microarray. All experimental procedures were performed following manufacturer instructions.
