TITLE
ETS Family Transcriptional Regulators Drive Chromatin Dynamics and Malignancy in Squamous Cell Carcinomas (RNA-Seq I)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After characterizing super-enhancer-associated chromatin dynamics accompanied by malignant progression of skin stem cells, we show that ETS family members auto-regulate themselves and a cohort of cancer-associated super-enhancer transcription factors which together are essential for tumor maintenance.

DESIGN
Mouse skin squamouse cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor-initiating stem cells (SCC-SC), hair follicle stem cells (HF-SC) and epidermal stem cells (Epi-SC) were FACS-prufied for RNA-sequencing.
