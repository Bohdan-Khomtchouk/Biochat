TITLE
TTHB212 (anti-sigmaE)-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain: time course

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of TTHB212-deficient of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich medium at 70°C for 7 and 8 hours

DESIGN
TTHB212-deficient T. thermophilus HB8 cells were each pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 7 or 8 h, respectively, and then, the expression of each mRNA was analyzed.
