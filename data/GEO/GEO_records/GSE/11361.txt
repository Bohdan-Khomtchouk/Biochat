TITLE
Genetic variants in Major Histocompatibility Complex-linked genes Associate with Pediatric Liver Transplant Rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Limited access to large samples and independent replication cohorts precludes genome-wide association (GWA) studies of rare but complex traits. To localize candidate genes in an on-going study utilizing family-based GWA, a novel exploratory analysis was first tested on 1,774 major histocompatibility complex single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 240 DNA samples from 80 children with primary liver transplantation (LTx), and their biological parents. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumHap550k SNP BeadArray; the genotype calls for the 1813 SNPs in the MHC region are provided in the genotype_data.zip supplementary file linked to this series (see README file in the zip archive for more information). The Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array was used to measure differential splicing patterns in archived RNA isolated from 26 of 80 children for genes found near associated SNPs. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
DNA from LTx rejector children were compared against LTx non-rejector children to identify associated SNPs in a two-level analysis approach.  Those SNPs that were found to be most associated were then identified for splice variant influence using the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST Array.
