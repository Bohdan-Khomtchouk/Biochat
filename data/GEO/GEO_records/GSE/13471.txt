TITLE
Expression data from human normal pre-frontal cortex, liver, and colon tissues and colon tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation, at CpG islands and promoters, is often inversely correlated with gene expression. We used expression microarrays to determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in 5 normal prefrontal cortex samples and 5 normal liver samples from the same individuals as well as between 4 colon tumor and matched normal colon mucosa (from the same individuals). Keywords: human tissue comparison

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from pre-frontal cortex and liver tissue from 5 individuals for which we have genome-wide DNA methylation data and hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. Similarly, we isolated RNA from 4 tumor and matched normal colon samples that we have genome-wide DNA methylation data.
