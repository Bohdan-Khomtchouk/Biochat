TITLE
Expression data from human normal pre-frontal cortex, liver, and colon tissues and colon tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation, at CpG islands and promoters, is often inversely correlated with gene expression. We used expression microarrays to determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in 5 normal prefrontal cortex samples and 5 normal liver samples from the same individuals as well as between 4 colon tumor and matched normal colon mucosa (from the same individuals). Keywords: human tissue comparison
