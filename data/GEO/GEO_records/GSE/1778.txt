TITLE
ENCODE: GWLA of TAF1, RNA PolII binding in four cell lines

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
Genome-wide location analysis of TAF1 and RNA polymerase II binding in ENCODE regions of IMR90, HCT116, HeLa and THP1 cell lines.  There are a total of 8 experiments, each with three replicates. Details of chromatin immunoprecipitation and data analysis can be found at Li Z, van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee WK, Zhang MQ, Ren B (2003) A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.
