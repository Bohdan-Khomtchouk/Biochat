TITLE
Expression profiling of WI38 normal lung fibroblasts following overexpression of p53 and/or Retinoblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression profiling was performed on normal human lung fibroblast WI38 cells following overexpression of p53 and pRb, in order to identify genes co-regulated and involved in mediating p53 and pRb tumor suppressor processes.

DESIGN
Four condition experiment with four biologicial replicates of each condition in a two-color reference design. The four conditions were Adenovirus with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor (control); Adenovirus with p53 gene under control of CMV; Adenovirus containing RB1 gene under control of CMV; Adenovirus containing p53 and RB1 gene under CMV.
