TITLE
Genome-wide small RNAs analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human alphaherpesvirus 1

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare small RNA profiles (sRNA-seq) of HSV-1 infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 strain at 48 hours post infection.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles of  HSV-1 infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 cells at 48 hours post infection were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens) GPL23890 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens; Human alphaherpesvirus 1)
