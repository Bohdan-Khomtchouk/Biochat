TITLE
CMV 2b immunoprecipitated small RNAs data set

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that CMV2b exist in a complex of sRNAs in arabidopsis, with significant preference to repeat-associated AGO4-related 24nt siRNAs. This differential selection of siRNAs in vivo helps CMV 2b to perturb host epigenetic defense in the form of transposons activation and severeal repeat associated loci hypomethylation.

DESIGN
Examination of CMV 2b presence in sRNAs complex in vivo

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
