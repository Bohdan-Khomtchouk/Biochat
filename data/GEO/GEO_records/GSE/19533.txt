TITLE
Gene expression changes in the human diaphragm following cardiothoracic surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is unknown how soon the diaphragm begins to start the process of atrophy following the start of MV. We hypothesized that genes responsible for maintaining diaphragmatic contractile function, stress response, energy transduction would be altered over the course of a 5 hour cardiothoracic surgery.

DESIGN
Two diaphragm biopsies were obtained from 5 male patients (~67 +/- 11 years) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The first biopsy was obtained as soon as the diaphragm was exposed; the second biopsy was obtained as late in the surgery as possible (4.9 +/- 1.8 hours). We profiled mRNA from the 5 pairs of muscle biopsies with a microarray (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0).
