TITLE
Time-course analysis of microglia-specific RNA-seq in two severities of spinal cord injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of microglia following spinal cord injury demonstrated that microglia response is driven by time after injury but not lesion severity.

DESIGN
Microglia were purified by FACS in non-injured CX3CR1+/eGFP mice and at 3 time points following moderate and severe spinal cord lesion. Gene profiles were then compared.
