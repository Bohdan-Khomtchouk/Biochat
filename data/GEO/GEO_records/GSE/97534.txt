TITLE
RNA sequencing of developing cone photoreceptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the transcriptomes of postmitotic cone photoreceptors in the central region of the mouse retina every day between birth (P0) and eye opening (P12). At each postnatal day we isolated GFP-labeled cells from three different Chrnb4-GFP mice (biological triplicates) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We then acquired the transcriptomes of the sorted cones using next generation RNA sequencing. Our data set contained 39 transcriptomes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of isolated cone photoreceptors at 13 timepoints

PLATFORM
