TITLE
Regulation of uptake hydrogenase and effects of hydrogen utilization on gene expression in Rhodopseudomonas palustris

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris

SUMMARY
We used transcriptome analysis to identify genes that were differentially expressed between wild-type (CGA010) and hupV mutant cells (CGA009) grown photoheterotrophically with malate under nitrogen-fixing conditions. We also compared the transcriptome of a hupS mutant with that of the wild type. Keywords: Genetic modification
