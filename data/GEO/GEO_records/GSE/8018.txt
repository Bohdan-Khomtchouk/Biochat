TITLE
Gene expression in the quail MBH under short and long day conditions.

ORGANISM
Coturnix japonica

SUMMARY
Various physiological processes and behaviours are controlled by changing daylength. To dissect genes involved in the photoperiodic changes in physiology and behaviour, global expression analysis was performed using quail kept under short and long day conditions. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
The mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of quail kept under short day condition (6h light:18h dark) or long day condition (20h light:4h dark) were collected for RNA extraction. Pooled total RNA from three MBHs was labelled and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Samples were collected from 6 birds every 4h during a 24 h cycle and were analyzed in duplicate set of array (two biological replicates).
