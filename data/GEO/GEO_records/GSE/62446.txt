TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the metabolic impact of higher oligopeptide assimilation mediated by horizontally acquired oligopeptide transporters Fot1/2 in wine strains.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of a higher oligopeptide assimilation mediated by Fot1/2, oligopeptides transporters acquired by HGT on wine yeast cell metabolism in winemaking conditions,we carried out a comparison of transcriptomic profiles of the wine wild type strain 59A and the deletion mutant of FOT1/2 genes during exponential growth.

DESIGN
Two strains (59A and 59A FOT-deleted) at 2 released CO2 time point (5g/L and 10g/L) are analyzed. Each condition are in quadriplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL17690 Agilent-038619 Yeast ORF + regions A, B and C + KHR1 + MPR1 (Probe Name version)
