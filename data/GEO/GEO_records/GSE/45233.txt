TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Human Injured Meniscus Reveals a Distinct Phenotype of Meniscus Degeneration with Aging

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have tested the variation in gene expression signatures in human injured meniscus with age and degree of chondrosis in the knee. We found several genes that were differentially regulated with each of these factors and they represent important biological pathways in osteoarthritis research.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated injured meniscus tissues from patients undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.
