TITLE
Hypoxic response in wild type and HIF-1alpha null hepatoctyes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in hepatocyte gene expression under short-term hypoxic conditions in wild type and HIF-1a null cultures.  To this end, hypoxia treated cultures were subjected to incubation with 1% O2/5% CO2/94% N2 at 37Â° C for eight hours prior to RNA isolation.  Duplicate normoxic controls were established from separate animals wherein cultures were untreated and treated with Adbgal.  Biological triplicates of wild type and HIF-1a null cultures were placed under hypoxic conditions and subsequently processed for microarray analysis.  A total of 10 microarray hybridizations were performed. Keywords: repeat sample
