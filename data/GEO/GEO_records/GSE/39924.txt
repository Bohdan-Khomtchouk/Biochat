TITLE
Expression data from Shox2 knockout and wildtype right atria of E11.5 mouse hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The heartâ€™s rhythm is initiated and regulated by a group of specialized cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart. Abnormalities in the development of the SAN can result in irregular heart rates (arrhythmias). Although several of the critical genes important for SAN formation have been identified, our understanding of the transcriptional network controlling SAN development remains at a relatively early stage. The homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 plays an essential early role in the specification and patterning of the SAN. Here, we compared gene expression levels in the right atria of wildtype and Shox2-/- hearts using microarray experiments to identify Shox2 target genes.

DESIGN
Right atria of E11.5 mouse embryos were dissected and genotyped for RNA extraction. RNA from 6 embryos and 2 independent pregnancies was pooled per genotype (Wildtype and Shox2 Knockout) and compared.
