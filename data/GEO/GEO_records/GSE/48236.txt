TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of rats' mRNA profile after knocking down PIWIL1 in embryonic cultured neurons.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have demonstrated that PIWIL1 can regulate neuronal radial migration during corticogenesis. In order to explore the mechanism, we carried out high-throughtput sequencing (mRNA profile) to define downstream target of PIWIL during the process of neuronal migration. And we found the expression level of several microtubule-associated proteins decreased after downregulation of PIWIL1. Therefore, PIWIL1 plays an important role in neuronal migration by regulating the expression microtubule-associated proteins (such as Map1B, Map2, Tau) .

DESIGN
Examine mRNA profile in two groups of primary cultured neurons with electroporation of control or RNAi plasmid.
