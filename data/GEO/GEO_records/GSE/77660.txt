TITLE
MNase-seq of Tetrahymena thermophial macronucleus (MAC) and micronucleus (MIC)

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila CU428

SUMMARY
In this study, we have employed MNase-Seq to reveal distinct nucleosome distribution patterns in morphologically and functionally differentiated MIC and MAC from asexually dividing Tetrahymena cells.

DESIGN
Comparing the nucleosome occupancy features in Tetrahymena MAC and MIC.
