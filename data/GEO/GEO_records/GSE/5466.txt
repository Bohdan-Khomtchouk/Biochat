TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate UAMS1 and its isogenic agr and sarA mutants

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to compare the global, growth phase-dependent transcriptional profiles of two isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. One isolate is a prototypic laboratory strain named RN6390, and has been used frequently as a model organism for study of staphylococcal physiology and virulence. However, recent studies indicate that RN6390 is not, in general, genotypically or phenotypically representative of clinical isolates of Staphyloccos aureus. Therefore, there is no current comprehensive picture of gene expression patterns in a virulent, clinical isolate of Staphyloccous aureus. For these reasons, we compare the transcriptional profile of RN6390 to that of a virulent clinical isolate, UAMS-1. Also included in this study is profiling of two UAMS-1 regulatory mutants, UAMS-155, and UAMS-929. These strains possess mutations in the accessory gene regulator (agr) and staphylococcal accessory regulator (sarA) genes, respectively. These two genes are well described global regulatory molecules that are reported to play important roles in controlling virulence factor production and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. However, most study of these two molecules has been limited to laboratory strains such as RN6390. For these reasons, this study also includes transcriptional profiling of UAMS agr and sarA mutants.
