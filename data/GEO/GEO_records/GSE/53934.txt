TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression and intron retention during deveopment in a U12-type splicing-deficient zebrafish mutant [microarray]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To determine the global impact of the clbn mutation on gene expression and efficiency of U2- and U12-type splicing, we analyzed the transcriptome of 108hpf wt and clbn mutant larvae by microarrays and RNA sequencing. RNAseq data was used to characterize intron retention of U2-type and U12-type intron on a genome-wide scale to confirm that rnpc3 deficiency specifically impairs U12-type splicing. RNAseq and microarray data were combined to yield high-confidence lists of differentially expressed genes which show that impaired U12-type splicing has a wide-ranging effect on the developing transcriptome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from pools consisting of approx. 20 individually genotyped homozygous wildtype or mutant larvae, respectively. Three biologically independent replicate pools were generated and analyzed for each condition.
