Transcription elongation factor ELL2 influences splicing versus poly(A) site choice in the Ig heavy chain gene

SUMMARY
Processing of Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) mRNA is a paradigm for competition between splicing and polyadenylation.  In plasma cells pre-mRNA is polyadenylated mainly at the promoter-proximal secretory site while B-cells utilize a cryptic 5â€™ splice site in the last secretory-specific exon; these are mutually exclusive events for all IgH pre-mRNAs.  Transcription elongation factor ELL2, more abundant in plasma cells relative to B-cells, was down-modulated by overexpression of heterogenous ribonucleoprotein F, a condition which reduced production of secretory IgH mRNA.  Transfection of B-cells with ELL2 and the IgH reporter showed an accelerated use of the secretory poly(A) site, positioned in competition with the splice to M1; a small interfering RNA to ELL2 reduced expression of IgH secretory mRNA.  Co-transcription factors ELL1 and PC4 were ineffective at driving secretory-poly(A) site use.  ELL2 had little effect on poly(A) site choice with reporters containing tandem-linked poly(A) sites.  Shorter forms of ELL2 protein result from both internal initiation at M186 and protein processing.  An alternative splicing reporter driven by IgH or non-Ig promoters revealed that ELL2 and its M186 initiated form were able to accelerate exon skipping.  Therefore, ELL2 influences IgH pre-mRNA processing through facilitating skipping of the alternative splice to the membrane form.
