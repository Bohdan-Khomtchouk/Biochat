TITLE
Effect of in vitro transcription time on the fidelity of T7-based RNA linear amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Zhao et al. Amplification Figure 1 This experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of in vitro transcription time on the fidelity, reproducibility, and yield of T7 based linear amplification. Duplicate reactions were performed at 37 degree for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours. Two additional 5-hour incubation reactions were stored at 4 degree overnight to determine the effect of low temperature incubation on amplification. BC2 total RNA was amplified using the Jeffrey lab protocol with the G50 column cleanup step. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
