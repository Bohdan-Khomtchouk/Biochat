TITLE
Genome-wide identification of Hfq-regulated small RNAs in the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora

ORGANISM
Erwinia amylovora

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis was performed to examine the sRNA transcripts in wild type E. amylovora 1189 and in the deletion mutant of hfq, at 6 and 12 hours of culture in hrp-inducing minimal medium.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from wild type Ea1189, and the hfq mutant of Ea1189, at 6 and 12 hours post inoculation in hrp-inducing minimal medium.  RNA transcripts that are between 50-350 nucleotides were analyzed by RNA-seq.  Intergenic transcripts whose expression was greatly reduced in the hfq mutant than the wild type at both 6 and 12 hours post inoculation in hrp-inducing minimal medium were selected as potential small RNAs.
