TITLE
Mesenchymalâ€“Epithelial Transition in fibroblasts of human normal lungs and interstitial lung diseases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the possible occurrence of MET, fibroblasts from normal lungs and from interstitial lung diseases were cultured under standard conditions. When was observed an unusual epithelial-like phenotypic change gene expression was evaluated by complete transcriptome microarrays.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts from normal lungs and from interstitial lung diseases were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
