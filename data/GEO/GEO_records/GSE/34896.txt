TITLE
Muscle specific proteasome deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways are the two major routes for protein and organelle clearance. In skeletal muscle, both systems’ excessive activation induces severe muscle loss. Although altered proteasomal function has been observed in various myopathies, the specific role of proteasomal activity in skeletal muscle has not been determined by loss-of-function approaches. Here, we report that muscle-specific deletion of a crucial proteasomal gene, Rpt3, resulted in profound muscle atrophy and decrease in force. Rpt3 null muscles showed reduced proteasomal activity in early age, accumulation of basophilic structure, disorganization of sarcomere, and formation of vacuoles and concentric membranous structures in electronmicroscope. We also observed accumulation of ubiquitin, p62, LC3, TDP43, FUS and VCP proteins. Proteasomal activity is important to preserve muscle mass and to maintain myofiber integrity. Our results suggest that inhibition/alteration of proteasomal activity can contribute to myofiber degeneration and weakness in muscle disorders, such as inclusion body myositis, characterized by accumulation of abnormal inclusions.

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior muscles from Rpt3 null and control mice. each 3 mice.
