TITLE
OVX/oil/6h/UTX 129 WT vs. Hoxa-10-/-

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Female mice used were SvJ/129, 10-16 weeks of age; Hoxa-10+/+ and Hoxa-10-/- littermates were used in parallel experiments.  14 days after ovariectomy, mice were injected with sesame oil (Sigma; 0.1mL/mouse), followed by sacrifice and removal of uterine horns at 6 hours after injection.  8 uterine horns from 4 mice were pooled to form one sample.  Total RNA preparation, cRNA labeling and hybridization were performed according to recommendations by Affymetrix.  All 6 samples were collected and processed in parallel. Keywords: other
