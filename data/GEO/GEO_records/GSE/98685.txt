TITLE
Enhanced base editing by co-expression of free uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Even the latest generation of base editor (BE3) causes unwanted indels and non-C-to-T substitutions, compromising the fidelity of base editing outcome. Here we report a enhanced base editing system. The enhanced base edting system decreased the formation of unintended indels and C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions, and increased the frequency of desired C-to-T substitution, thereby improving both the accuracy and efficiency of base editing.

DESIGN
Examination of indels and base substitutions induced by the enhanced base editing system
