TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Drosophila melanogaster 30 minutes after alcohol exposure

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA extracted from heads of a D. melanogaster population that was sedated with a stream of ethanol saturated vapor, 30 minutes before RNA extraction; and from an age-matched untreated control group. Differential gene expression between the two groups was calculated and reported.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in heads of D. melanogaster adult females after ethanol exposure was performed using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology.
