TITLE
Expression data from LIF treated chordoma cell lines U-CH1 and MUG-Chor1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor is an important cytokine of the IL family. Recent findings suggest it has a crucial role in cancer progression We used microarray to monitor the global changes in gene expression after LIF treatment for 3 weeks in two chordoma cell lines

DESIGN
Chordoma cell lines U-CH1 and MUG-Chor1 were treated 3 times a week with 100ng/mL recombinant human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor. Cells were harvested and microarray was conducted.
