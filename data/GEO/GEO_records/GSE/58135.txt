TITLE
Breast Cancer RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed on breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on 28 breast cancer cell lines, 42 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) primary tumors, and 42 Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) and HER2 Negative Breast Cancer primary tumors, 30 uninovlved breast tissue samples that were adjacent to ER+ primary tumors, 5 breast tissue samples from reduction mammoplasty procedures performed on patients with no known cancer, and 21 uninvolved breast tissue samples that were adjacent to TNBC primary tumors.
