TITLE
Role and function of Bach2 in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of Bach2 in pre-B ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from wildtype and Bach2 knockout mice of C57Bl6 background and transformed them with BCR-ABL1.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of Bach2 wildtype and knockout pre-B ALL cells, both with and without imatinib treatment (2uM for 16h).
