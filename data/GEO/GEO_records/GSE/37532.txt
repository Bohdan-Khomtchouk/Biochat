TITLE
Gene expression profile of regulatory T cells (Tregs) isolated from visceral adipose tissue and lymph nodes of mice sufficient and deficient of Pparg expression in Tregs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified Pparg as a major orchestrator of the phenotype of adipose-tissue resident regulatory T cells (VAT Tregs). To establish the role of Pparg in shaping the VAT Tregs gene profile and cell dynamics, Tregs from lymph nodes and visceral adipose tissue of mice sufficient and deficient of Pparg expression in Tregs were double sorted for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified (double-sorted) T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled. Triplicates were generated for all groups. Raw data were preprocessed with the RMA algorithm in GenePattern and averaged expression values were used for analysis.
