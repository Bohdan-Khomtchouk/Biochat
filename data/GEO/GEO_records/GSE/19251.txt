TITLE
KKTa_isolated glomeruli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High dietary fat intake is a major risk factor for the development of obesity, which is frequently associated with diabetes. To identify genes involved in diabetic nephropathy, GeneChip Expression Analysis was employed to survey the glomerular gene expression profile in diabetic KK/Ta mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD).

DESIGN
Isolated glomeruli from three 20-week-old KK/Ta mice fed with HFD (HFD group) or a normal fat diet (Chow group) were dissected. Total RNA was extracted and labeled for hybridization using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. The gene expression profile was compared between the HFD and Chow groups using GeneSpring 7.3.1 software.
