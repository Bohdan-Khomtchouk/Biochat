TITLE
Gene expression changes in differentiated cortical neurospheres pre-exposed to ethanol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cerebral cortical-derived neurosphere cultures were exposed to ethanol to model heavy alcohol exposure during the period of cortical neurogenesis Keywords: Compared differentiated neurospheres pre-exposed to ethanol to untreated differentiated neurospheres

DESIGN
We analyzed 8, dual labeled, 22K Mouse arrays where 4 arrays correspond to one channel (Ch1) that represents the control (no ethanol) and the other channel (Ch2) represents the treatment (ethanol exposed), and the other 4 arrays were 'dye-flips' so Ch1 corresponds to the treatment (ethanol exposed) and Ch2 corresponds to the control (no ethanol) "
