TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in whole blood samples from a case-control study of 192 Irish patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Cases had T1D and nephropathy whereas controls had T1D but no evidence of renal disease. emails: christopher.bell@cancer.ucl.ac.uk, a.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk Keywords: DNA methylation

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 192 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
