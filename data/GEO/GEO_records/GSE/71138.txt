TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles for Agrobacterium tumefaciens wild-type strain C58 grown with or without iron.

ORGANISM
Agrobacterium tumefaciens

SUMMARY
The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens attaches to and forms biofilms on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. The transition between free-living, planktonic A. tumefaciens and multicellular biofilms is regulated by several well-defined environmental and nutritional inputs, including pH, oxygen tension, and phosphate concentration. In many bacterial species limiting iron levels inhibit attachment and biofilm formation. We demonstrate that A. tumefaciens biofilm formation is reduced under limiting iron conditions. Treatment of A. tumefaciens cultures with EDDHA, an iron-specific extracellular chelator, inhibited both planktonic growth rate and adherent biomass. These effects were reversed upon addition of exogenous ferrous iron. This reduced biofilm formation effect is independent of the known iron-responsive regulators Irr and RirA. Transcriptome analysis comparing gene expression under iron-replete versus iron-deficient conditions identified hundreds of genes that are differentially regulated. Downregulated genes suggest an iron sparing response.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates, independent RNA preparations, one dye swap.
