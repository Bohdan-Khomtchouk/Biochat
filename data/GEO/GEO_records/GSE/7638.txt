TITLE
Expression data from monocytes of individuals with different collateral flow index CFI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
using peripheral blood monocytes  to identify marker genes for an extensively grown coronary collateral circulation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying collateralization and identified distinct classes of  differently regulated genes during this process. Keywords: observational study

DESIGN
Collateral flow index (CFI) was obtained invasively by angioplasty pressure sensor guidewire, a group of patients with coronary artery disease CAD and a group without CAD were selected for peripheral monocyte isolation, RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
