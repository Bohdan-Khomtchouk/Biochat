TITLE
M. smegmatis vapBC::aphA-3 Î”vapBC mutant (JR121) harboring tetracycline inducible vector pMind containing the vapBC operon (pJR230) and the pMind vector containing the vapC toxin gene (pJR29)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of M. smegmatis JR121 expressing VapC and VapBC grown in flasks on Hartmans de Bont medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol

DESIGN
Comparing transcriptional response of strain JR121 to conditional expression of VapC toxin compared with the expression of VapBC complex. Biological replicates: 4 independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
