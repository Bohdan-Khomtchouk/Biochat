TITLE
Total RNA sequencing of INS-GFP+ cells differentiated from HES3 hESCs treated with DMSO or H1152

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To systematically examine the cellular identity of INS+ cells derived after H1152 treatment, INSw/GFP HES3 hESCs were differentiated to a pancreatic progenitor population and treated with 10 ÂµM H1152 for 8 days in sphere culture. The INS-GFP+ cells of H1152 or DMSO treated spheres were purified by cell sorting and transcripts profiled using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
The INS-GFP+ cells of H1152 or DMSO treated spheres were purified by cell sorting and transcripts profiled using RNA-seq. Rat insulin promoter driven ZsGreen-sorted beta cells from human islets were also assayed.
