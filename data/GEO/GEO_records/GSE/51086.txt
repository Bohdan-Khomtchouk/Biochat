ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 29 untreated breast cancer cell lines using Agilent 4x44K V1 (G4112F) dual color oligonucleotide microarrays The primary study objective was to establish a research resource for comparative transcriptomic analysis of a series of commercially available breast cancer cell lines representative of diverse histopathologic and molecular subtypes, generated on the Agilent oligonucleotide platform. A specific study objective was to perform a comparative transcriptional analysis of three cell lines established from a patient with triple negative metaplastic inflammatory breast cancer developed by Drs. Felding Habermann and Smider at the Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA. Cancer Res 2011;71(24 Suppl):Abstract nr PD03-07.

DESIGN
Commercial cell lines were cultured in replete media using manufacturer-recommended conditions and harvested during exponential growth phase using TRIzol Reagent. Total RNA was prepared from each cell line and a pooled reference was generated containing an equimolar concentration of RNA from all cell lines. Individual cell lines were differentially labeled relative to the reference pool and hybridized to Agilent Commercial V1 4x44K oligonucleotide microarrays.
