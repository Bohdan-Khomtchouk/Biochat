TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we characterize the protein uptake and degradation pathways of S. cerevisiae to better understand its impact on protein secretion titers. We do find that S. cerevisiae can consume significant (g/L) quantities of whole proteins. Characterizing the systems with metabolomics and transcriptomics, we identify metabolic and regulatory markers that are consistent with uptake of whole proteins by endocytosis, followed by intracellular degradation and catabolism of substituent amino acids. Uptake and degradation of recombinant protein products may be common in S. cerevisiae protein secretion systems, and the current data should help formulate strategies to mitigate product loss.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains at different cultivation conditions were selected at early glucose phase in batch fermentations for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Biological triplicates were applied, and strains growing at normal conditions (with no BSA supplemented) were used as the control strain.
