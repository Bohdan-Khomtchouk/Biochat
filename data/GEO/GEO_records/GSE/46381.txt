TITLE
Effect of NDRG1 deletion and hypoxia in mouse placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify changes in placental gene expression that may contribute to the phenotype of NDRG1-deficient embryos, and to define the contribution of hypoxia and fetal sex to these changes. We therefore used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to interrogate differences in placental gene expression, stratified by fetal sex, Ndrg1 status (WT vs KO) and oxygenation (21% vs 12%).

DESIGN
C57Bl6/J mice heterozygous for NDRG1-null allele were bred and separated next day (E0.5), and give ad libitum access to standard chow and water with 12h light:dark cycle. Pregnant dams were sacrificed at E15.5 by cervical dislocation following isoflurane anesthesia. Following sacrifice, embryos and placentas were collected, NDRG1 genotype and sex were determined by PCR of fetal tissue, and RNA was extracted from placental tissue following removal of membranes.
