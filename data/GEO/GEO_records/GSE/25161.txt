TITLE
Nutrigenomics in honey bees: the impact of pollen nutrients on bee health

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
We studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of pollen nutrients on honey bee (Apis mellifera) health and how those nutrients improve resistance to parasites. Using digital gene expression, we determined the changes in gene expression induced by pollen intake in worker bees parasitized or not by the mites Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan of bees.

DESIGN
bees with or without verroa, and fed or not fed pollen

PLATFORM
GPL11166 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Apis mellifera)
