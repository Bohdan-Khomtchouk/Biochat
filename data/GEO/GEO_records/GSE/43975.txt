TITLE
Epigenome-wide analysis of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for body mass index

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of MZ twins discordant and concordant for BMI. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Samples included 30 MZ twin pairs discordant for BMI and 10 pairs concordant for BMI.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 80 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
