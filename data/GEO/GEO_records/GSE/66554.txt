TITLE
Expression data of LncRNA from the rat (Sprague-Dawley) knee articular cartilage at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Age as the primary rise factor could be play an important role in incidence and development of osteoarthritis. A few studies have confirmed some tissue specific lncRNA were associated with development of osteoarthritis. But if age related lncRNA would be involved in pivotal post-transcriptional gene regulation in osteoarthritis is unclear. In view of this, we have an idea that several age-related lncRNA would be screened from the rat knee cartilage at different development ages by lncRNAs Microarray analysis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the rat knee cartilage and identified distinct classes of age-related lncRNA during this process.

DESIGN
The rat knee articular cartilage were selected at successive stages of the rat developmental for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix lncRNA arrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of cartilage at each developmental stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we hand-selected cartilage according to the rat developmental stages, i.e. seven time-points: newborn (T0), youth(T1), adult (T2), early-stage elderly(T3) and latter-stage elderly(T4).
