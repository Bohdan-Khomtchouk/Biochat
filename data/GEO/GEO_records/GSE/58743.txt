TITLE
Identification of transcripts regulated by CEBPA in K562

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of CEBPA on the expression of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs), we utilized the K562 AML cell line carrying a stable and Tet-on inducible CEBPA allele. K562 cells lack endogenous CEBPA and restoration of its expression induces proliferation arrest and granulocytic differentiation .

DESIGN
Based on the expression of known CEBPA transcriptional targets, we selected RNA extracted from 48 hours of induction (CEBPA) together with RNA extracted from control-induced cells (CTR). 4 biological replicates for each sample have been utilized.
