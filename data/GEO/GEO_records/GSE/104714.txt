TITLE
Clustering gene expression time series data using an infinite Gaussian process mixture model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify and characterize novel human gene expression responses to glucocorticoids, we exposed the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 hrs in duration as well as to a paired vehicle control, ethanol. We assayed gene expression with RNA-seq and clustered gene expression profiles using an infinite Gaussian process mixture model.

DESIGN
Time series treatment of human A549 cells with dexamethasone or paired vehicle control.
