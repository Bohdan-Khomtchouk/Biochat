TITLE
Transcriptional response to tetanus toxoid in pigs with divergent humoral and lean growth performance

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In vivo microarray study of transcriptional changes in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during the immune response to tetanus vaccination

DESIGN
Comparisons of high (hiLG) vs. low lean growth (loLG) and high antibody titer (hiAB) vs. low AB (loAB) Expt type: Mixed model including repeated measures
