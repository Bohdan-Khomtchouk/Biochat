TITLE
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) liver transcriptome response to diets containing camelina products

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
This study was performed to investigate assess the impacts of CO and/or CM containing diets on Atlantic salmon hepatic gene expression in order to identify candidate molecular biomarkers of responses to camelina-containing diets. Atlantic salmon were fed diets with complete or partial replacement of FO and/or FM with camelina oil (CO) and/or camelina meal (CM) in a 16-week trial (Control diet: FO; Test diet: 100% FO replacement with CO, with solvent-extracted FM and inclusion of 10% CM (100COSEFM10CM). A 44K microarray experiment identified liver transcripts that responded to 100COSEFM10CM (associated with reduced growth) compared to FO controls at week 16.

DESIGN
Atlantic salmon were fed for 16 weeks with the FO or 100COSEFM10CM diet (three tanks per diet). Liver samples were taken from 7 fish from each tank at week 16. A universal reference design was used for the microarray experiment. For the test samples, RNA was used from individual livers of fish from the 2 treatment groups: FO and 100COSEFM10CM. For each treatment group we used 9 biological replicates (3 fish from each of 3 tanks). All test samples were labeled with Cy5. The common reference was a pool of 18 RNA samples from livers of fish from all individuals invovled in microarray experiment. The common reference was labeled with Cy3. Each individual test sample was hybridized together with the common reference sample on an array, so the experiment consisted of 18 arrays
