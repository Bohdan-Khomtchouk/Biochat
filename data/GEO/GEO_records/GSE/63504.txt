TITLE
miRNA profile of microglial cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Migroglia cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 3 h. The miRNA was isolated and the expression profiles of OGD-activated cells were compared with the profiles of resting cells.
