TITLE
Receptor quaternary organization explains G protein-coupled receptor family structure.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To investigate the quaternary structures of Rhodopsin-family GPCRs. Method: Analyzed 60 receptors from HEK 293T cells. Results: 1) Most of these receptors are monomers. 2) The phylogenetic distribution of dimers suggests that monomers have an evolutionary advantage due to constraints imposed by dimerization on rates of receptor diversification.

DESIGN
To investigate the quaternary structures of 60 Rhodopsin-family GPCRs expressed in HEK 293T cells using type-1 and -3 BRET assays.
