TITLE
Next-generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5 transcriptomes in xenografts of DU-145 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KLF5 possesses both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities, though the mechanism controlling these opposing functions is unknown. In cultured non-cancerous epithelial cells, KLF5 converts from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative activity upon TGFβ-induced acetylation, which sequentially alters the KLF5 transcriptional complex and the expression of genes such as p15 and MYC. In nude mice, KLF5 also suppressed tumor growth in an acetylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, deacetylation switched KLF5 to tumor-promoting activity, and blocking TGFβ signaling attenuated the tumor suppressor activity of KLF5. The results from RNA-Seq indicated the different downstream genes of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5 and the mechanisms that determine the opposing functions of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which KLF5 switches from anti-tumorigenic to pro-tumorigenic function, and also suggest the roles of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5, respectively, in the tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting functions of TGFβ.

DESIGN
Xenografts of DU-145 cell lines expressing KLF5, KLF5 mutant K369R or the empty vector PLHCX were surgically isolated from mice at day 38 after injection. RNA-Seq was performed using these three groups of xenografts.
