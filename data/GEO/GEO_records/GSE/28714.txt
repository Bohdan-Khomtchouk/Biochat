TITLE
Gene expression in Longissimus lumborum in pig using the GenmascqChip (custom 15K Agilent microarray)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Genetic variability of transcript abundance in pig skeletal muscle at slaughtering.

DESIGN
The 325 pigs (females and barrows) used in gene expression analyses are part of a larger F2 population of 1,000 animals, setup within the framework of a QTL detection program. These animals were produced as a second generation intercross between two commercial sire lines (F016, Pietrain type line, and FH019, synthetic line from Hampshire, Duroc and Large-White founders, FRANCE-HYBRIDES, St Jean de Braye, France).
