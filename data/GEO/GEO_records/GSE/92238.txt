TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptonal profiling in whole hippocampus in WT and Arid1b+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There is growing evidence for the involvement of ARID1B, a SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling subunit, in a broad range of human disorders. Sequencing studies have recurrently implicated ARID1B haploinsufficiency in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID), corpus callosum agenesis, and short stature. In addition, ARID1B is by far the most common cause of Coffin-Siris Syndrome (CSS), a monogenic developmental delay syndrome characterized by a combination of the neuropsychiatric and physical abnormalities mentioned above. To understand how ARID1B mutations lead to these phenotypes, we generated Arid1b mutant mice, which exhibited physical manifestations of developmental delay and behaviors reminiscent of ASD. In the brain, Arid1b haploinsufficiency resulted in changes in the expression of SWI/SNF- regulated genes implicated in ASD.

DESIGN
WT and Arid1b+/- hippocampus at P80
