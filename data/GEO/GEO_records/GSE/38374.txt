TITLE
Metabolic responses of the model archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 to oxygen limitation

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
As part of a comprehensive post-genomic investigation of the model archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we used whole genome DNA microarrays to compare transcriptional profiles of cells grown anaerobically via arginine fermentation versus cells either respiring aerobically in the presence of oxygen or anaerobically using trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) as a terminal electron acceptor.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively performed series of experiments were performed to examine the effects of regulator deletions (dmsR, bat) and oxygen limitations of Haloarchaeal cells. Microarrays were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 2484 genes, leading to the successful identification of affected genes.
