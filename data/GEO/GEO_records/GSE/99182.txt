TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of D29, StarStuff and L5

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium virus D29 ; Mycobacterium virus L5 ; Mycobacterium phage StarStuff

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of mycobacteriophage D29 and StarStuff were analyzed 15min, 30min, 60min and 150min post-infection (MOI=3), as well as a StarStuff lysogen.  The gene expression profiles of 30min and 150min post-induction of an L5 thermo-inducible lysogen, as well as the L5 lysogen itself.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated, depleted of rRNA and library prepped (Illumina TruSeq)

PLATFORM
GPL23502 Illumina MiSeq (Mycobacterium phage D29) GPL23503 Illumina MiSeq (Mycobacterium phage StarStuff) GPL23504 Illumina MiSeq (Mycobacterium phage L5)
