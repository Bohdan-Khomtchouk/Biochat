TITLE
Regulation of Ptch1 expression in the limb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ptch1 is a critical negative feedback regulator of the Hedgehog signaling and is upregulated in response to pathway activation. How tissue specific responses are mediated remains unknown. Here, we performed ChIP-seq analysis for epitope-tagged endogenous Gli3 protein to identify limb-specific binding regions within the 500 kb region surrounding Ptch1.

DESIGN
ChIP was carried out using an endogenously FLAG-tagged Gli3 protein.
