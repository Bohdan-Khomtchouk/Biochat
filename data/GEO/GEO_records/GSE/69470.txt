TITLE
microRNA expression  profiling of human sarcoma cell lines (~68)  in the Molecular Pharmacology Branch, DTP, DCTD NCI collection of human cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of ~68 cell lines derived from human sarcoma and 5 normal counterpart cells,  including drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and microRNA expression profiling have been completed. Data and tools for searching these data will be made  publicly available through the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program. The raw data (RCC files) are  provided through the GEO website. Sarcoma represents a variety of cancers at arise from cells of mesenchymal origin and have seen limited treatment advances in the last decade. Drug sensitivity data coupled with the transcription and microRNA profiles of a cohort of sarcoma cell lines may help define novel treatment paradigms.

DESIGN
For each cell line, microRNA expression was measured on nCounter miRNA Expression Arrays (Nanostring Technologies), providing multiplexed, digital detection and counting of 800 human microRNA's. Please note that there are 2 replicates included in the study: A-204-rep1 and A-204-rep2, ES-4-rep1 and ES-4-rep2 resulting total 77 samples.
