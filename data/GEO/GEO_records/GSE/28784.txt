TITLE
Gene expression data of sensitive, Docetaxel resistant and Paclitaxel resistant MDA-MB-231 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The taxanes, namely Paclitaxel and Docetaxel, are important and widely used cancer chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of invasive and metastatic human breast cancer.  Although treatment with the taxanes is beneficial to many patients, drug-responsive tumors in patients with metastatic breast cancer often display resistance to these drugs, either initially or over time following the continued administration of chemotherapy drugs.  To investigate the patterns of cross-resistance with the taxane drugs and to identify potential mechanisms of resistance, we generated a series of MDA-MB-231 taxane resistant cell lines. We then used microarrays to determine gene expression differences between sensitive, Docetaxel and Paclitaxel resistant MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from three independent passages of sensitive, Docetaxel and Paclitaxel resistant cell lines and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit.  Total RNA was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip HU133A arrays.
