SUMMARY
Experiment on the effects of ethanol (acute oral) on induction of genes by polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly IC). Microarray methodology follows: cDNA for each sample was synthesized from 8.5 µg total RNA using a Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in combination with a T7-(dT)24 primer. Following phenol-chloroform extraction of the cDNA, biotinylated cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (ENZO Biochem, New York, NY) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Twenty micrograms of purified cRNA was fragmented by incubation in fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mM potassium acetate, 150 mM magnesium acetate) at 94°C for 35 minutes and chilled on ice. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to the Murine Genome U74Av2 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), interrogating a total of 12,488 murine gene cDNA probes, for 16 hr at 45°C with constant rotation (60 rpm). The arrays were washed and then stained for 10 min at 25°C with 10 µg/mL streptavidin-R phycoerythrin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by 3 µg/mL biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 10 minutes at 25°C. Arrays were then stained once again with streptavidin-R phycoerythrin for 10 min at 25°C. After washing and staining, the arrays were scanned using an Agilent GeneArray Scanner (Agilent Technologies) at 570 nm. Pixel intensities were measured, expression signals were analyzed and features extracted using a commercial software package (Microarray Suite ver 5.0, Affymetrix). Data mining and statistical analyses were performed with Data Mining Tool ver 3.0 (Affymetrix) algorithms. Arrays were globally scaled to a target intensity value of 2,500 in order to compare individual experiments. The absolute call (present, marginal, absent) of 12,488 gene expressions in each sample, as well as the direction of change, and fold change of gene expressions between samples were identified using the above-mentioned software.
