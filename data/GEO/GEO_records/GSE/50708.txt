TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by Rcor1 in CD71+, TER119- erythroid progenitors using mRNA-seq analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription cofactor Rcor1 has been linked biochemically both to neurogenesis and hematopoiesis. Here we studied the function of Rcor1 in vivo and showed it is essential to erythropoeisis during embryonic development. Rcor1 mutant proerythroblasts, unlike normal cells, can form myeloid colonies in vitro. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms for block of erythropoiesis and increased myeloid potential, we used RNA-seq to reveal the differentially expressed genes from erythroid progenitors due to depletion of Rcor1.

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from FACS sorted CD71+,TER119- erythroid progenitors from control (Rcor1+/+ and Rcor1+/-) or Mutant (Rcor1-/- ) E13.5 fetal liver. Each library was made by pooling RNA from several fetal livers. Two biological replicates were made for either control or mutant condition.
