TITLE
Microarray analysis of wildtype, Klf3 H275R homozygous and heterozygous, Klf3 CH gene trap homozygous and heterozygous E12.5 embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to investigate the dysregulation of gene expression in whole E12.5 embryos containing a gene trap (CH) or point mutation (H275R) within the Klf3 gene Affymetrix microarrays were performed on RNA from wildtype, Klf3 H275R/H275R, Klf3 H275R/+, Klf3 CH homozygous and Klf3 CH heterozygous E12.5 embryos

DESIGN
Four wildtype replicates, three Klf3 H275R/H275R replicates, four Klf3 H275R/+ replicates, four Klf3 CH homozygous replicates and two Klf3 CH heterozygous replicates of whole E12.5 embryos, litter-matched where possible.
