TITLE
Hematopoietic Kit Deficiency, but not lack of mast cells, protects mice from onesity and insulin resistancel

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of epididymal AT transcriptome between Kit-deficient mast cell-deficient mice and Kit Wild-type mast cell deficient mice after 16 weeks of HFD feeding

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from epididymal AT WBB6F1.KitW/Wv mice, WBB6F1.Cpa3Cre/+ and WBB6F1.Cpa3+/+ mice that were fed a HFD (60% kcal from fat) or chow diet (6% fat) for 12 weeks
