TITLE
Expression data from High-grade prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecules to serve as diagnostic markers for high-grade prostate cancer (PC) and targets for novel therapeutic drugs, we investigated the gene expression profiles of high-grade PCs using a cDNA microarray combined with laser microbeam microdissection.

DESIGN
For this study, we collected 10 frozen specimens from high-grade PCs with high PSA levels and high Gleason score (GS) in clinically using prostatic needle biopsy. All needle biopsy specimens were at clinical stages T2 to T4 with or without N1 and M1 and their GS were 8-9. Moreover, all 10 patients had not received androgen ablation therapy. Simultaneously, normal prostate (NP) epithelial cells were also microdissected from five non-prostate cancer (BPH) patients. These NP cells from five males were used as a normal mixture control for our cDNA microarray analysis.
