TITLE
Scf-GFP+ cells from the bone marrow and whole bone marrow microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The HSC niche factor SCF is required for HSC maintenance. Using an Scf-GFP knockin mouse, we have identified a perivascular cell type in the bone marrow expressing high level of Scf. To characterize the novel Scf-GFP+ cells from the bone marrow, we performed microarray analysis on these cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from 3 independent, freshly aliquots of FACS sorted 5,000 SCF-GFP+ cells or whole bone marrow cells isolated from young adult mice. Purified RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation™ Pico RNA Amplification system (NuGEN Technologies). Sense strand cDNA was generated using WT-Ovation™ Exon Module (NuGEN), then fragmented and labeled using the FL-Ovation™ cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN). 2.5µg of labeled cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 microarrays.
