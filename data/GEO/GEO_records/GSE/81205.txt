TITLE
The transcriptional outputs of AP2 and AG in floral development at the genomic scale

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine whether AP2 and AG have antagonistic effects on transcription, The gene expression profiles of Ler, ag-11, ag-11 ap2-35 and ag-11 ap2-43 were examined using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Inflorescences containing stage 7 and younger flowers were used, and three biological replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
