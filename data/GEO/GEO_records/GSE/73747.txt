TITLE
Epigenetic Dysregulation in the Developing Down Syndrome Brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using Illumina 450K arrays, 1.85% of analyzed CpG sites were hypermethylated and 0.31%  hypomethylated in fetal Down syndrome (DS) cortex throughout the genome. The vast  majority of differentially methylated promoters and genes was hypermethylated in DS and  located outside chromosome 21, including the Î³-protocadherin (PCDHG) cluster on  chromosome 5q31, which is crucial for neural circuit formation in the developing brain.  Bisulfite pyrosequencing and targeted RNA sequencing showed that several genes of PCDHG  subfamilies A and B are hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated in fetal DS  cortex. Decreased PCDHG expression is expected to reduce dendrite arborization and growth  in cortical neurons. Dysregulation of CPT1B and NOX5 may be associated with mitochondrial  dysfunction and increased cell damage in the developing DS brain. Since constitutive  hypermethylation of PCDHG and other genes affects multiple tissues, including blood, it may  provide useful biomarkers for DS brain development and pharmacologic targets for  therapeutic interventions.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 72 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
