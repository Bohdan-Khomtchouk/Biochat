TITLE
Arabidopsis gene expression profile : Col-0 wild-type vs. pif3pif4pil5pil6 (pifQ) mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 60h-old Arabidopsis whole seedlings comparing control Col-0 wild-type plants with pifQ mutant plants The expression profile of dark-grown pifQ mutant shows similar pattern of Rc-grown Col-0 wild-type Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
In all cases, 60h-old dark-grown Col-0 wild-type was used as background. 2-condition experiment, Rc-grown Col-0 vs. dark-grown pifQ. Biological replicates : 3 each, was independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
