TITLE
Identification of genes responding to the activity of the Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 KLUH/CYP78A5

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 KLUH (KLU)/CYP78A5 promotes organ growth in a non-cell autonomous manner. To identify genes regulated by KLU activity, homozygous klu-2 mutants carrying constructs for EtOH-inducible overexpression of wild-type KLU (35S::AlcR-AlcA::KLU) or of enzymatically inactive KLU protein (35S::AlcR-AlcA::KLUmut) were induced with EtOH and sampled at 90 min and 240 min after induction for gene expression changes. Keywords: Time course, genetic modification
