TITLE
Effect of ∆13RAP2.12 overexpression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The effect of the overexpression of a stabilized version of the transcription factor RELATED TO APETALA2.12 (RAP2.12) on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis rosettes was investigated. To this purpose, 4-week old rosette of wild-type and 35S:∆13RAP2.12 plants were compared. Samples were composed of pools of 3 plants.

DESIGN
In total, 6 samples were analyzed, subdivided in 2 theses with 3 replicates each. 35S:∆13RAP2.12 plants were compared to wild-type plants (Col-0 ecotype).
