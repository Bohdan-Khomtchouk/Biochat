TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in p53-null cell types following deletion of Mdm2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing was performed to gain insight into the mechanism responsible for the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by loss of Mdm2 in p53-null cells. Following CreERT2-mediated deletion of Mdm2 in three p53-null cell types (T cell lymphoma, sarcoma, and fibroblasts), RNA-sequencing was performed. This high-throughput data revealed Mdm2 deletion in p53-null cells upregulated p53/p73 transcriptional target genes known to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

DESIGN
Mdm2 was deleted in p53-null cells (T cell lymphoma and sarcoma and non-transformed fibroblasts) and gene expression profiles were compared using RNA-sequencing.
