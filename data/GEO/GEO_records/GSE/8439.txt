TITLE
Retionic acid gene expression time series in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinoic acid RA time course experiment: H1 cells(WiCell Research Institute, WA01, Passage40) maintained in TeSR1 were treated with 1uM retinoic acid (RA) in a detailed time course:day0,day0.5,day1,day1.5,day2,day3, day4 and day5 . Total RNA was prepared by usage of the Qiagen RNA extraction kit.  mRNA was purified and then labeled and hybridized to HG17 NimbleGen human expression chips to evaluate changes in gene expression during RA-induced differentiation. Keywords: Retionic acid gene expression time series human embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
Samples from eight time points  were taken after RA treatment  (0,0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4,5 days) of H1 hES cells in TeSR1 medium. In addition, the experiment includes biological replicates at days 0 and 5.
