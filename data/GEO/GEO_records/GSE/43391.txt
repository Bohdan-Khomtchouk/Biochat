TITLE
Murine E14,5 DRGs: TrkAC-KI vs. Wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of embryonic DRG neurons from TrkAC-KI and wild type mice.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, TrkAC-KI vs. Wild type. Three independent biological replicates, each containing DRGs from 6-8 embryos from multiple litters, were prepared for each genotype.
