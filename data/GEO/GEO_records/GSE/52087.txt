TITLE
Heme-Bound Iron Activates Placenta Growth Factor via Erythroid Krüppel‐like Factor in Erythroid Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have tested the effect of iron on the gene expression profile in human leukemia cells with properties of erythroid differentiation.

DESIGN
12 Total samples were analyzed. We compared the gene expression profiles of cells treated with iron mesoporphyrin to mesoporphyrin alone. DMSO vehicle was also tested as a control.
