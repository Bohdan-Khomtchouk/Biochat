TITLE
Expression data from homozygous deletion of the Lgi1 gene in murine neural precursor-like cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypercellularity in the outer layers of the cortex in Lgi1 null mice suggested that Lgi1 possibly plays a role in controlling cell migration dynamics. To investigate this hypothesis, we first generated and immortalized neural precursor-like cells (NPC), isolated from Lgi1 null and wild type mice at E13.5 stage using Large-T antigen. Subsequently, we compared gene expression patterns between the immortalized NPC-like cells with the two different Lgi1 genotypes using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Our studies suggest that Lgi1 has a role in regulating neuronal migration and their synapse formation and that its absence/dysregulation can result in seizure despite a histologically subtle cortical dysplastic phenotype.

DESIGN
RNAs were extracted from the null and wild type NPC cells, respectively. The samples were biologically triplicated. RNA samples were hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array.
