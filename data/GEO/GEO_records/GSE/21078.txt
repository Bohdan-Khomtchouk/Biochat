TITLE
small RNA sequencing of two developmental stages of Ciona intestinalis

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
We report the comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages (larva and gastrula) of the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. These libraries were used for the identification of microRNAs in this organism.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNA libraries from 2 stages of Ciona intestinalis.

PLATFORM
GPL9911 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Ciona intestinalis)
