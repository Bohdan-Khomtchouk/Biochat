TITLE
Gene expression data of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) from Thailand Initiative in Genomics and Expression Research for Liver Cancer (TIGER-LC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix HTA2.0 microarray profiling to analyze gene expression patterns in tumor and paired non-tumor tissue of HCC and CCA patients. We used microarrays data to identified molecular subgroup of HCC and CCA patients from Thailand

DESIGN
For gene expression profiling, tumors and paired non-tumor tissues were profiled separately using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw gene expression data were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method and sketch-quantile normalization method on Affymetrix Expression Console Software Build 1.3.1.187.

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
