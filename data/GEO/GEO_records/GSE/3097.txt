TITLE
Barley1 salinity stress study

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Shoot tissue from 17 day old barley plants was used for expression analysis.  Targets from three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Barley1 Genechip arrays.  Comparisons between the control and stressed samples at three time points (3, 8 and 27 h) allow the identification of salt stress responsive genes. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
3 control and 3 salt stressed biological replicates were analyzed at 3, 8 and 27 h.
