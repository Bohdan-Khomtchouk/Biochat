TITLE
Histone modifications in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
Genome wide mapping of five histone marks (H3K4me2, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3AcK9/14) as well as nucleosome occupancy was generated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing. To gain insights into the dynamic nature of the P. tricornutum epigenome in response to an environmental cue, we analyzed the impact of nitrate depletion. We specifically examined three histone modifications (H3K4me2, H3K9/14Ac and H3K9me3) using Chip-seq.

DESIGN
Examination of 5 different histone modifications.
