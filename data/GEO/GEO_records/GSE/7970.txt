TITLE
Wistar rats with iron deficiency and repletion and Belgrade rats normally fed or fed iron in drinking water: villus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression along the crypt-villus (C-V) axis was analyzed using cryostat sectioning to isolate fractions representing the crypts (bottom) and villus tops (top). These fractions were used for analyzing gene expression in iron replete Wistar rats (++), iron deficient Wistar rats (low iron), and in iron deficient Wistar rats fed iron for 3 and 6 days (iron-fed).  Differences were observed between the crypts and villus tops in the expression of genes associated with Wnt and BNP signaling, cell proliferation and apoptosis, lipid and iron transport and metabolism.  Gene expression in villus crypts and tops was also compared between Wistar and Belgrade rats (bb) and Belgrade rats fed iron (iron-fed) particularly as related to iron absorption and metabolism to define the affects of the mutation in DMT1 in the Belgrade rat on the expression of genes related to iron absorption and metabolism and the response to iron feeding. Keywords: iron stress response
