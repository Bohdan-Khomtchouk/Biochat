TITLE
Molecular pathways reflecting poor intrauterine growth are imprinted in Whartonâ€™s jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells [Set2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify gene-expression patterns in mesenchymal stem cells associated with different birth weights and intrauterine growth parameters, we conducted comparative microarray gene expression experiments prior and post acute insulin stimulation

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were extracted from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord of normal and SGA babies. The MSCs were expended in culture. The MSCs were subjected to acute insulin treatment for various time points. The RNA of these cells were collected for gene-expression study.
