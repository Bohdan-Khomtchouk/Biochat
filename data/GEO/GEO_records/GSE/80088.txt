TITLE
Genome-wide maps in PDGFB-induced glioma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide profiling of oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (Olig2) and other histone markers in platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB)-induced glioma and genome-occupancy analyses coupled with transcriptome profiling to reveal gene regulatory network.

DESIGN
Examination of Olig2, H327Ac, and H3K4me3 genome-wide occupancy in PDGFB-induced Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO brain tumors (gliomas).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
