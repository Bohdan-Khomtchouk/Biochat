TITLE
Expression profiles of Embryonic stem cells derived from normal fertilization and parthenogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the imprinting loci, we designed microarray analysis on the parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells and normal embryos. We could predict 217 imprinting domains associated with embryo development and maternal imprinting. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Five embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were derived from two F1 hybrid strains that were produced by mating female C57BL6 mice with male DBA2 or CBA/Ca mice. Two-week-old prepubertal female was used for follicle retrieval. All procedures for animal management, breeding, and surgery followed the standard protocols of Seoul National University, Korea. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Review Board at Seoul National University approved our research proposal in April 2005 (approval number: SNU0050331-02). Three parthonogenetic ES embryo cell lines were established from parthenogenetic activation on naturally ovulated oocytes (OpB6D2-SNU-1) and in vitro-growth oocytes (FpB6CBA-SNU8 and FpB6D2-SNU2). Two normal ES embryo cell lines were derived from mating naturally ovulated female mice in estrus with male mice (NmB6D2-SNU-1) and purchased from ATCC. Detailed procedures, including establishment of ES cell lines can be found elsewhere (FpB6CBA-SNU8, FpB6D2-SNU2 and OpB6D2-SNU-1 for and NmB6D2-SNU-1 and OP1 for manuscript in preparation).
