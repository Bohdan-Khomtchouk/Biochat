TITLE
Altered global gene profile in KSHV-infected primary oral fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common HIV/AIDS-associated tumor worldwide. Involvement of the oral cavity portends a poor prognosis for patients with KS, but mechanisms for KSHV regulation of the oral tumor microenvironment are largely unknown. Infiltrating fibroblasts are found with KS lesions, and KSHV establishes latent infection within human primary fibroblasts in vitro, but contributions for KSHV-infected fibroblasts to the KS microenvironment have not been previously characterized. In the present study, we used Illumina microarray to detect the global gene profile altered in KSHV-infected primary human fibroblasts (PDLF and HGF) isolated from the oral cavity.

DESIGN
PDLF and HGF cells were infected by KSHV and the gene expression signature was compared to respective mock cells
