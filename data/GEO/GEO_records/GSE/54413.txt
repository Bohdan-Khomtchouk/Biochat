TITLE
Genome-wide Transcriptional Profiling of Skin and Dorsal Root Ganglia after Ultraviolet-B-Induced Inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation of the skin was performed on rat (skin and DRG) and human (skin) tissue. The resulting changes in gene expression were then profiled by using RNA-seq to compare gene expression between irradiated and non-irradiated samples

DESIGN
Poly(A) selected RNA was sequenced for 5 irradiated and 4 non-irradiated humans (skin), and for 6 irradiated and 6 non-irradiated rats (DRG and skin)
