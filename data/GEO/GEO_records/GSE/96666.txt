TITLE
Salicylic acid-dependent and -independent transcriptome changes in response to methyl-erythritol cyclodiphosphate accumulation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
MEcPP overaccumulation in the ceh1 mutant results in significant transcriptome changes as reported by microarrays, of which some are dependent on the SA accumulation in this mutant. In order to gain better resolution of transcriptomic changes in ceh1 as well as the SA dependence of these changes, we performed RNAseq analysis of RNA extracted from wt, ceh1, eds16 deficient in SA production, and ceh1/eds16

DESIGN
Three biological replicates each of Col-0 (=p, =wt), ceh1, eds16, ceh1/eds16
