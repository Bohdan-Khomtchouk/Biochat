TITLE
POLIISER5 and POLIISER2 ChIP-Seq in mutant RNAi LID Drosophila Melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
LID is a histone demethylase acting on H3K4me3, a mark related to transcription and found near the transcription start sites (TSS) of the genes. We analyzed where POLIISER5 and POLIISER2 are localized in LID RNAi mutants.

DESIGN
1 sample for POLIISER5 with an input control, and 1 sample for POLIISER2 with an input control.
