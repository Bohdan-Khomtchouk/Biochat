TITLE
Identification of differentially regulated genes in flcn-1 mutant C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder that is characterized by the clinical triad of benign skin tumors - so-called fibrofolliculomas, recurrent pneumothoraces due to pulmonary cysts and the formation of kidney tumors. The molecular function of Folliculin (FLCN), the protein product of the BHD gene mutated in this syndrome, has remained elusive to a large extent. Animal models such as mouse, rat and canine models have been used to elucidate parts of the pathway in which FLCN plays a role showing it to interfere with AMP-kinase and mTOR signaling. Caenorhabditis elegans provides - due to its simple genetic amenability and large brood size - the perfect tool to study signal transduction pathways in detail. Thus, we decided to examine F22D3.2 (flcn-1) - a putative orthologue of FLCN in the nematode. We established the first gene expression profiles of a strain harboring a mutation in flcn-1 compared to WTN2 allowing for a first insight into the function of this gene in C. elegans. This study examines the transcriptome of the flcn-1 mutant strain RB1035 in comparison to WTN2 in order to identify differentially regulated genes.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from pre-reproductive adults in both WTN2 and RB1035 (harboring a flcn-1 mutant allele, mutant worms had been backcrossed wo WTN2 8 times) using biological triplicates. RNA was labeled and hybridized to Agilent C. elegans whole genome microarrays and scanned using a Agilent Technologies Scanner G2505C US22502540.
