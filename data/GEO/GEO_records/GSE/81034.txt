TITLE
Measuring lncRNAs in Exosomes from Prostate Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form the largest transcript class in the human transcriptome. These lncRNA are expressed not only in the cells, but they are also present in the cell-derived extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. Our study examines the expression of lncRNAs in several prostate cancer cell lines but also measures the levels of these lncRNAs in the released exosomes. We show that specific lncRNAs are enriched in cancer exosomes and furthermore these sequences harbour miRNA seed regions and appear to be enriched for specific RNA binding motifs.

DESIGN
A total number of four different prostate cancer cell lines and one normal cell line was used for this study. Total RNA was extracted from exosomes and the parent cell line. LncRNA expressions were then measured using a lncRNA arraystar array.
