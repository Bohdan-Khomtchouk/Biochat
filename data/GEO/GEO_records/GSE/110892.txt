TITLE
Neural Stem Cell Extracellular Vesicle-Treated Microglia and Transcriptional Response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from primary cultures of neural stem cells (NSCs) and used to treat microglia.

DESIGN
EVs were isolated by serial centrifugation from primary NSCs cultured from the subventricular zone of CD1 mice. Cultured microglia were then subjected to control or EV treatments and RNA isolated by Trizol extraction. Library preparation was performed with an NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Preparation Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (New England Biolabs). 2 x 150 base pair reads were generated at a depth of 56-84 million reads per sample on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
