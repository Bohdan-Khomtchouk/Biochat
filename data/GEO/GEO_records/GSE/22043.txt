TITLE
Expressoin data from iPSC with different cell of origin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been derived from various somatic cell populations through ectopic expression of defined factors. It remains unclear whether iPSCs generated from different cell types are molecularly and functionally similar. We use expresson profiling to determine differnces in iPSCs with different cell of origin.

DESIGN
Using a secondary system, we derived iPSCs from tail tip-derived fibroblasts (TTF-iPSC), splenic B cells (B-iPSC), bone marrow-derived granulocytes (Gra-iPSC) , skeletal muscle precursors (SMP-iPSC) and T cells (T-iPSC).
