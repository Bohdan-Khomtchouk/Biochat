TITLE
Effects of capture-release events in wild dolphins: PBL analysis

ORGANISM
Tursiops truncatus

SUMMARY
Goal: To determine the effects of capture-release events in wild dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Methods:  An analysis of the Peripheral Blood Leukocyte (PBL) transcriptome was conducted on a group of 20 animals. The samples were collected in 2 different locations along the US east coast (Charleston, SC; Indian River Lagoon, FL) and 2 blood samples were collected for each dolphin 1) immediately after the capture event (*pre*) and 2) just before the animal was released (*post*). In between *pre* and *post* blood collections (30-40 minutes) additional samples were collected from the animals for physiological, chemical and biochemical analysis. RNA extracted from *pre* and *post* blood samples was used for micorarray hybridizations and transcriptome analysis using a species-specific PBL cDNA microarray (Mancia *et al*., 2007). Keywords: blood cells (PBL)

DESIGN
time course, field collection/wild caught organisms,  For multiple hybridizations: serial, biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL3609 Tursiops truncatus cDNA Microarray version 1.0
