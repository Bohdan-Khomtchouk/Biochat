TITLE
Gene expression profiling of normal mouse hepatocyte, premalignant hepatocytes and fully malignant HCC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analyzed and compared of normal mouse hepatocyte, premalignant hepatocytes and fully malignant HCC cells. The results provide valuable information about the gene expression alterations during the chronic process of liver cancer development.

DESIGN
HCC in age-matched male mice were induced by DEN injection. Normal mouse hepatocyte, premalignant hepatocytes and fully malignant HCC were freshly isolated and RNA extracted.
