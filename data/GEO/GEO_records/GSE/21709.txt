TITLE
Expression data of Streptococcus pneumoniae against penicillin

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4

SUMMARY
The increasing rate of penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae in the early 1970s has resulted in therapeutic challenges and has prompted the need for alternative therapy in the management of pneumococcal infections. The development of penicillin resistance has been documented to be as a result of altered penicillin binding protein which alters the binding capacity of the drug to the organism. We used microarrays to investigate other genes  which may be involved in the development of penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and identified classes of genes on the surface of the organism which may contribute to resistance.
