TITLE
Identification differentially expressed genes in the mouse testis caused by Prss54 deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further investigate molecular mechanism of Prss54 in mouse, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential role to be downstream targets of Prss54.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, testis from three wildtype and three Prss54 knockout adult mice were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 41,267 unique genes, leading to the fully understand the function of Prss54.
