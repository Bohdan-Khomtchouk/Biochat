TITLE
Splenic bridging channel dendritic cells survey red blood cells for missing self-CD47

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vivo exposure of Â mouse CD4+ splenic DCs to sheep red blood cells causes prompt induction of multiple genes associated with DC activation.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from CD4 dendritic cells (sorted from mice immunized with either sheep red blood cells or PBS) were generated using an Illumia HiSeq 2500. Sequence reads passing a quality filter were aligned to mouse genome (mm10) using Tophat.

PLATFORM
