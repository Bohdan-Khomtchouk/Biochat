TITLE
Effects of SO2 on yeast metabolism and changes in the transcriptional profiles

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we report the massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis performed using high throughput sequencing of a vineyard yeast strain collected from the vineyards of the Piave AO (Appellation of origin) (R008 strains) region in North East of Italy and 3 commercial yeast strains (EC1118, VL3 and AWRI796). Yeast cells were collected at the same step of the fermentation curve: at the beginning of the process, when the CO2 produced by the cells was 6 g/l (middle exponential growth phase). The fermentations have been performed for each strain with no SO2 added and with SO2 added at a final concentration of 25 mg/l. Three biological replicates of the fermentations were performed for each strain and samples for RNA-seq were gathered at the beginning of the process. The aim of this experiment was the comparison of the transcriptomes of the four yeast strains to identify the genes characterizing sulphites response.

DESIGN
Eight samples were analyzed: R008 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with no SO2 added (previously submitted with ID GSM1092510, experiment GSE44845),  R008 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with 25mg/l of SO2 added, EC1118 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with no SO2 added (previously submitted with ID GSM1092506, experiment GSE44845), EC1118 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with 25mg/l of SO2 added, VL3 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with no SO2 added, VL3 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with 25mg/l of SO2 added, AWRI796 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with no SO2 added, AWRI796 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced) with 25mg/l of SO2 added.
