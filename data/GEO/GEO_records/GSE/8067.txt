TITLE
Multiple genes at the chromosome 20q amplicon contribute to colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal instability (CIN) is the hallmark of colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression in 85% of cases, with 20q gain as the most prominent aberration. Yet, the oncogenes at this chromosomal gain are still largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify oncogenes at 20q involved in colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression by measuring the effect of  20q gain on gene expression in this amplicon. Segmentation of DNA copy number changes on 20q was performed by array CGH in 67 colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. Additionally, robust analysis of mRNA expression in these segments was performed in 68 adenomas and carcinomas. This approach revealed seven genes to be important in CIN related adenoma to carcinoma progression. These genes may both serve as highly specific biomarkers for presence of high-risk precursor lesions as well as potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention. Keywords: Integration of array CGH and expression microarrays in colorectal cancer progression

DESIGN
We performed array CGH on a panel of 41 progressed adenomas, from which the adenoma and carcinoma components were separately analysed (total, 82 samples). The DNA obtained from these samples was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Additionally we analysed a series of independent frozen adenomas and carcinomas by array CGH (34 adenomas and 33 carcinomas) and expression microarrays (37 adenomas and 31 carcinomas). For array-CGH we used as reference DNA for all samples, a pool of 10 normal individuals. For expression microarrays we used as reference a commercial available RNA (pool of different cancer cell lines), from Strategene. No replicates nor dye swaps were done.
