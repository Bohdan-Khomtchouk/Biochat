TITLE
Distinct mesenchymal lineages and niches promote epithelial self-renewal and myofibrogenesis in the lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using flourescence activated cell sorting, we gated on cells negative for CD45, CD326 and CD31, from single cell suspension generated from Adult mice. We then isolated subsets of YFP-, GFP- or TdTomato expressing cells from the indicated reporter mice. tdTomato indicates Wnt-responsive cells, GFP reports Pdgfr-alpha expression and YFP- was used to isolate lineaged Wnt2-positive cells. Additionally we included cells that were negative for the aforementioned reporters. We performed RNAseq on biological duplicates for each subset.

DESIGN
Adult Axin2CreERT2:tdT:PdgfraEGFP and Wnt2CreERT2:R26REFYP mice lungs were FACS sorted into five corresponding lineages for RNAseq.
