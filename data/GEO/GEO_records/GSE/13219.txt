TITLE
Activity motifs reveal principles of timing in transcriptional control of the yeast metabolic network

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Significant insight about biological networks arises from the study of network motifs –overly abundant network subgraphs, but such wiring patterns do not specify when and how potential routes within a cellular network are used. To address this limitation, we introduce activity motifs, which capture patterns in the dynamic use of a network. Using this framework to analyze transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions: forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction Measuring protein abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the protein level.  Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs, where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism's adaptation to new environmental conditions.

DESIGN
We generated a set of 13 time courses by measuring gene expression after a metabolic change. Yeast strain KCN118 (MATalpha ade2) was grown at 28 °C in 400 ml of synthetic complete media with 2% dextrose (SCD) to an OD600 of 0.6. Synthetic complete was prepared using the standard recipe, except 75 uM inositol was included. At OD600 of 0.6, 100 ml of cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen as a reference sample, and the remaining cells were rapidly collected by filtration, washed with distilled water and resuspended in 300 ml of one of the following media: SCE (SC + 2% ethanol), SCG (SC + 2% galactose), SM1 (SCD lacking amino acids A, R, N, C, Q, G, K, P, S, F and T), SM2 (SCD lacking amino acids L, I, V, W, H and M), S0 (SCD lacking all amino acids), S0G (no amino acids, 2% galactose) or S0E (no amino acids, 2% ethanol). The data appears in Figures 2 and 4 of the manuscript, as it relates to the global analysis of all the arrays used in the dataset. All time courses consist of the following time points (in min):  15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and were hybridized against the t = 0 time point of cells grown in SCD. Each time course was performed as one single biological replicate and one technological replicate, except where noted below. Specifically, the 13 time courses break down into the following groups: Media key: SCD (synthetic complete, not including inositol) SCE (SC + 2% ethanol) SCG (SC + 2% galactose) SM1 (SCD lacking amino acids A, R, N, C, Q, G, K, P, S, F and T) SM2 (SCD lacking amino acids L, I, V, W, H and M) S0 (SCD lacking all amino acids) S0G (no amino acids, 2% galactose) S0E (no amino acids, 2% ethanol). ino = inositol aa = all amino acids supplemented The following group descriptions are the media as described above, followed by the description as indicated in the long title of the individual arrays: 1.  S0 (5 arrays) = SD 2.  SCD (6 arrays, t = 240 min has 2 tech replicates) = SD+aa 3.  SM2 (5 arrays) = SD+aa:ARNCQGKPSDEFTY+ino 4.  SM1 + ino (5 arrays) = SD+aa:LIVWHM+ino 5.  S0 + ino (6 arrays, t = 240 min has 2 tech replicates) = SD+ino 6.  S0E (5 arrays) = SEtOH 7.  S0E + aa (7 arrays, t = 240 min and 60 min each have 2 tech replicates) = SEtOH+aa 8.  S0E + aa + ino (5 arrays) = SEtOH+aa+ino 9.  S0E + ino (8 arrays, t = 240 min, 15 min and 30 min each have 2 tech replicates) = SEtOH+ino 10. S0G (5 arrays) = Sgal 11. S0G + aa (5 arrays) = Sgal+aa 12. S0G + aa + ino (5 arrays) = Sgal+aa+ino 13. S0G + ino (6 arrays, t = 60 min has 2 tech replicates) = Sgal+ino
