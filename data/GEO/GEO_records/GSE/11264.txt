TITLE
A predictive and prognostic 38-gene expression signature for metastatic relapse in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background Currently, no gene-expression signature (GES) established from node-positive cohorts, able to predict breast cancer evolution after systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, exists. Methods Gene-expression profiles of 252 node-positive patients (median follow-up: 7.7 years), mostly included in a randomized clinical trial (PACS01), receiving systemic adjuvant regimen, were determined by means of cDNA custom array representing 5,776 distinct genes. Findings In the training cohort, we established a 38-GES for the purpose of predicting time to distant metastasis. The 38-GES yielded unadjusted hazard ratio of 4.86 (95% CI=2.76-8.56). Even when adjusted with the two best clinicopathological prognostic scoring: NPI and Adjuvant!, 38-GES HR were 3.30 (1.81-5.99) and 3.40 (1.85-6.24), respectively. Furthermore, 38-GES improved mostly NPI and Adjuvant! intermediate-risk classified patients. NPI intermediate-risk patients (7-year MFS=87.2%) were divided into 2/3 (7-year MFS=95.5%) close to NPI low-risk group and 1/3 (7-year MFS=69.3%) close to NPI high-risk group (HR=6.97 [2.51-19.36]). Adjuvant! intermediate-risk patients (7-year MFS=88.0%) were divided into 2/3 (7-year MFS=94.8%) close to Adjuvant! low-risk group and 1/3 (7-year MFS=71.7%) close to Adjuvant! high-risk group (HR=5.31 [5.38-11.87]). The 38-GES was validated on gene-expression datasets from three external node-positive breast cancer subcohorts (n=224) generated from different microarray platforms. The 38-GES yielded unadjusted HR=2.95 (1.74-5.01). Furthermore, 38-GES showed performance in supplementary cohorts with different lymph-node status and endpoint (1,031 new patients). Interpretation The 38-GES represents a robust tool able to type systemic adjuvant treated node-positive patients at high risk of metastatic relapse, and especially powerful to separate NPI or Adjuvant! intermediate-risk node-positive patients.

DESIGN
252 breast cancer patients at diagnosis examined with spotted cDNA nylon membrane. Patient details: PACS01x are 2 parts of a clinical trial : PACS01A : patients had received 6 cycles of FEC100 PACS01B : patients had received 3 cycles of FEC100 then 3 cycles of Docetaxel CCRG are patients from our local cancer center (Cancer Center Ren√© Gauducheau) included with the same criteria as PACS01A (6 cycles of FEC100).
