TITLE
Effect of hypoxia on gene expression in Grey poplar

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
The molecular responses of Grey poplar (Populus x canescens) following root hypoxia were studied in roots and leaves using transcript profiling. Grey poplar is a flooding tolerant tree species and analysis of the molecular response to hypoxia may indicate possible adaptation mechanisms to this stress.

DESIGN
The root system of the poplar trees were flooded for up to 168 h. At three time-points (5 h, 24 h, 168 h) plants were collected and leaf and root tissue analysed separately. At each time-point non-flooded controls were collected and analysed as well.
