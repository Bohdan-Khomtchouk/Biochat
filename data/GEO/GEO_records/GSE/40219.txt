TITLE
The galactose regulator GalX regulates the D-galactose oxido-reductive pathway in Aspergillus niger.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88

SUMMARY
Galactose catabolism in Aspergillus nidulans is regulated by at least two regulators, GalR and GalX. In Aspergillus niger only GalX is present, and its role in D-galactose catabolism in this fungus was investigated. Phenotypic and gene expression analysis of a wild type and a galX disruptant revealed that GalX does not substitute for the absence of GalR in A. niger,  it regulates the D-galactose oxido-reductive pathway, but not the Leloir pathway. Four genes, including the recently characterized ladB (galactitol dehydrogenase) were found to have differencial expressions that are highly relevant to GalX , indicating a novel oxido-reductive pathway in A.niger .
