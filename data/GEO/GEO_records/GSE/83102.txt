TITLE
Histone deacetylase 3 is essential for pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HDAC3 is necessary for implantation and decidualization, and its defects that may be a cause of reproductive failure. We used microarrays to detail the mechanism underlying HDAC3 loss for reproductive failure

DESIGN
Uteri of Hdac3 f/f and Hdac3 d/d mice were selected at 6 weeks of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
