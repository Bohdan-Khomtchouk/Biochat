TITLE
Genomic markers that predict survivorship in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic instability, including microsatellite instability (MSI) and gross chromosomal abnormalities, has been described in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) and MSI has been suggested to have prognostic significance. However, there are few prognostically relevant biomarkers. Here we explore the potential of the analysis of DNA copy number changes at 1Mb resolution to predict survivorship in sporadic CRC. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization
