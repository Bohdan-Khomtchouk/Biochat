TITLE
Genomic markers that predict survivorship in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic instability, including microsatellite instability (MSI) and gross chromosomal abnormalities, has been described in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) and MSI has been suggested to have prognostic significance. However, there are few prognostically relevant biomarkers. Here we explore the potential of the analysis of DNA copy number changes at 1Mb resolution to predict survivorship in sporadic CRC. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization

DESIGN
Single hybridization per case. 109 colorectal tumours were analyzed. Target (tumor) labeled with Cy5 and reference with Cy3. Mixture of 20 normal male or female genomic DNA was used in sex-mismatched hybridization. 30 of the tumors were also later hybridized to a second 1Mb resolution array also containing Chr18 sequences for a total of 139 samples. Definitions: MSI	Microsatellite instability MSI-H	Microsatellite instability at high frequency MSI-L	Microsatellite instability at low frequency
