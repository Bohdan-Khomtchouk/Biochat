TITLE
Genomic profiling of Estrogen receptor positive BRCA1-mutated breast cancer [Nimblegen human 135K]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: As estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers arises at an older age with less aggressive tumor characteristics than ER negative BRCA1 mutated breast cancer, it has been suggested that these tumors are ?sporadic? and not BRCA1-driven. With the introduction of targeted treatments specific for tumors with a non-functioning BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, the question whether the BRCA genes are impaired in the tumor, is highly relevant. Therefore, we performed genomic profiling of BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors. Experimental design: Genomic profiling, BRCA1 promoter methylation assessment, and loss of heterozygosity analysis were done on 16 BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors. Results were compared with 57 BRCA1-mutated ER- tumors, 36 BRCA2-mutated ER+ associated tumors, and 182 sporadic ER+ tumors [GSE9021, GSE9114, GSE16511, GSE50407] Results: The genomic profile of BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors was different from BRCA1-mutated ER- breast tumors, but highly similar to BRCA2-mutated ER+ tumors. In 83% of the BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors, loss of the wildtype BRCA1 allele was observed. In addition, clinico-pathological variables in BRCA1-mutated ER+ cancer were also more similar to BRCA2-mutated ER+ and sporadic ER+ breast cancer than to BRCA1 mutated ER- cancers. Conclusions: As BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors show a BRCAness copy number profile and LOH, it is likely that the loss of a functional BRCA1 protein plays a role in tumorigenesis in BRCA1-mutated ER+ tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that these tumors are sensitive to drugs targeting the BRCA1 gene defect, providing new targeted treatment modalities for advanced BRCA-deficient, ER-positive breast cancer.
