TITLE
Retinal transcripts level alteration in the prCAD -/- mouse, a model for retinal degeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcripts that exhibit changes in abundance in the context of retinal degeneration by comparing transcript levels in  adult wild type and prCAD -/-  mouse retinas. Keywords: genetic mutant analysis
