TITLE
Analysis of effect of sirt1 deficiency on global gene expression in testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Testis were obtained from 2 sibling pairs of of young male mice, 1 knock-out and 1 heterozygous for the Sirt1 allele, and used to compare global gene expression using spotted oligo microarrays (the MEEBO arrays from the Stanford microarray core- MOE series). Eighty genes were up or down regulated, where the criteria for differential expression was a greater than 2 fold change in expression level on at least 5 of the 6 sample arrays. The list of differentially expressed genes was enriched for genes involved in spermatogenesis. Keywords: spotted oligonucleotide microarray, mouse

DESIGN
2 pairs of Sirt1 knock-out and heterozygous testis were analyzed. The global gene expression was assessed intriplicate for each pair, including 1 dye swap.
