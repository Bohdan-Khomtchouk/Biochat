TITLE
Expression data from human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and the correponding non-cancerous tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identifythe the functional roles and the pathophysiological contributions of coding genes and noncoding RNAs in human hepatic carcinogenesis, we analysed the differenial expression of genes and noncoding RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and the corresponding non-cancerous tissues. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in human hepatocellular carcinomas and correponding non-cancerous tissues.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 14 pairs hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and correponding non-cancerous tissues were isolated and purified. Five micrograms of total RNA from each sample were used to synthesize double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), and then amplified and labeled with biotin and hybridized to the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
