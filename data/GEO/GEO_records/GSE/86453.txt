TITLE
Enrichment of pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were analyzed by DNA microarray. We identified differences and commonalities among six human pluripotent stem cell lines: the hESCs KhES1, KhES2, KhES3, and H1, and the iPSCs 201B7 and 243G1.  Analysis of DNA microarray data suggested that hepatocyte-like differentiation of EBs treated with ammonia in Lanford medium.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells were prepared using the standard method with MEF-coated dishes (ML) or MEF-conditioned medium method with matrigel-coated dishes (MC).  EB were formed by transferring small clumps (200 µm diameter) of hPSCs to a non-adhesive 60-mm dish coated with Lipidure. Suspension cultures were maintained for 5 days.  Following EB formation, 1 µL/mL of 10% w/v aqueous ammonia (Wako) was added to fresh Lanford medium. This process was repeated every 2 days for 14 days total.
