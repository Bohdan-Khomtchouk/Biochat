TITLE
S100P is a metastasis-associated gene that facilitates transendothelial migration of pancreatic cancer cells [HG-U133B]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with both local invasion and distant metastasis. Identifying the genes expressed in liver metastases and signatures of metastatic progression would therefore be of particular importance as they could aid in both recurrence prediction as well as representing novel therapeutic targets. Keywords: Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
We have performed microarray gene expression analysis of normal pancreas, primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), normal liver and pancreatic liver metastases to identify potential therapeutic targets.
