TITLE
Expression data from serum-starved human umbilical vein endothelial cells that have been treated with scrambled (scr) or Map4k4 siRNA to knock down genes of interest 48 hours prior to harvest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified that knocking down Map4k4 in endothelial cells affected genes associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, and inflammatory genes. We used microarrays to identify genes of interest that are differentially expressed after the addition of scrambled or Map4k4 siRNA.

DESIGN
HUVECs were treated with scrambled or siMap4k4. 24 hours later, cells were serum starved overnight. Cells were prepared with this protocol on three different occasions, and total RNA was isolated to provide three biological replicates per sample.
