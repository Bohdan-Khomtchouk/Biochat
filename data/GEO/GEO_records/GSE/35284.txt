TITLE
Gene expression in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
In this study, we investigate mRNA profiles in lung and liver of mice exposed to Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles. Female mice were exposed to three doses (0.018, 0.054 and 0.162 mg printex 90) and profiles were examined 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure. Our analyses reveal that carbon black nanoparticles cause inflammatory and acute phase responses that can trigger sterol sensitive pathways in liver.
