TITLE
Gene expression in HCT116 cells after JMJD1A/1B depletion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using microarrays to explore the global programme of gene expression after depeltion of JMJD1A and JMJD1B

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were transfected with JMJD1A and JMJD1B siRNA. 2 days post transfection the total RNA was extracted and analysed by microarray.
