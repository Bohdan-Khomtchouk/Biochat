TITLE
Expression data from young and old healthy humans, as well as HGPS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HGPS is a rare premature ageing disease, caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which activates a cryptic splice site, resulting in the production of a mutant lamin A isoform, called progerin. Sporadic usage of the same cryptic splice site has been observed with normal physiological aging. As it is unknown how HGPS causes premature ageing defects, we set out to determine the gene signature of both young healthy individuals, old healthy individuals, as well as HGPS patients.

DESIGN
All cell lines were grown in vitro using MEM tissue culture medium supplemented with 15%  foetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, pyruvate as well as pen/strep. RNA from cells was harvested using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
