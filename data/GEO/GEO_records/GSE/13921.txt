TITLE
Medicago truncatula germinated seedlings grown in Petri dishes for 3 days then carry out salt stress

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
time-course salt stress experiment of model legume Medicago truncatula roots using Affymetrix Medicago Array, aimed to dig some useful gene for improve salt resistance for legumes and other crops

DESIGN
4 samples of Medicago truncatula germinated seedlings grown in Petri dishes for 3 days 180mM NaCl salt stress material collect at 0, 6, 24, 48 hour after salt stress beginning 3 biological replicates 2 ug of total RNA was used to synthesize doublestranded cDNA
