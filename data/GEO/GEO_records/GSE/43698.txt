TITLE
Muscle from patients with mitochondrial myopathies and congenital muscular dystrophies versus normal human muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis was performed comparing human skeletal muscle samples from patients with various forms of muscular dystrophy and mitochondrial myopathies in order to  identify specific gene expression changes associated with collagen VI deficiency (leading to UllrichÂ´s Congenital Muscular Dystrophy) and depletion of mitochondrial DNA relative to other mitochondrial myopathies

DESIGN
We analysed the gene expression profile of skeletal muscle from children suffering from mitochondrial myopathies and various forms of muscular dystrophy relative to skeletal muscle from healthy children  using commercially available arrays that represents the complete human genome (Agilent Human SurePrintGE, 8x60K )

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
