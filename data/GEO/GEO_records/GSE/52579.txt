TITLE
Drosophila temperature sensitive col4a1 mutant (DTS-3) and control (OreR) comparison at permissive and at restrictive temperature

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have recently reported an allelic series of dominant, conditional, temperature-sensitive (DTS) mutations in the type IV collagen gene col4a1 in Drosophila and the onset of severe myopathy by massive degradation of striated muscle fibers, degeneration of epithelial and circular smooth muscle cells of the gut. In order to get a closer look at the molecular causes of the observed phenomena we have executed microarray experiments with the aforementioned mutant.

DESIGN
Two growth temperatures for both DTS-3 and OreR flies with dye-swap technical control replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6385 Agilent-018972 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Feature Number version)
