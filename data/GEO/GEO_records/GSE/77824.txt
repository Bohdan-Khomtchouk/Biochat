Multivalent Influenza DNA vaccine induces cross-reactive polyfunctional T lymphocytes and promotes rapid clearance of heterologous challenge strain in non-human primates

SUMMARY
Recent avian and swine-origin influenza virus outbreaks illustrate the ongoing threat of influenza pandemic.  New vaccines that offer accelerated production and broader, more universal protection against drifted and shifted strains are needed. Here, we investigated a multivalent PMED DNA vaccine for the ability to induce antibody and T cell responses against four HA antigens, nucleoprotein and the ectodomain of M2 (M2e).
