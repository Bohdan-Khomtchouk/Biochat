TITLE
Identification of transcription factor HLH-8 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for HLH-8 at L3 stage, which is required for normal muscle development and normal defecation and egg-laying. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
HLH-8 was tagged with a dual GFP:3xFLAG tag at the carboxy terminus, whose expression pattern was confirmed through both fluorescence imaging and immunoblot analysis. The binding sites were determined using ChIP-seq. Two biological replicates (one is early early L3) were used in this study and non-immunoprecipitated chromatin (input) from the same sample served as a control. The concordance between two replicates is just above 50% when p-value is 0.05
