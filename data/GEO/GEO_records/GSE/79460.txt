TITLE
TGFβ signaling directs serrated adenomas to the mesenchymal colorectal cancer subtype [adenomas]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer can be divided into four consensus molecular subtypes, which might associate with distinct precursor lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the subtype affiliation of two types of colorectal adenomas: tubular adenomas (TAs) and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) and to determine the activity of TGFβ signaling and the role of this cytokine in subtype affiliation. Adenoma samples were collected in the Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Tubular adenomas (TAs) were obtained from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) were collected from serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) patients.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed for 7 sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) and 9 tubular adenomas (TA).
