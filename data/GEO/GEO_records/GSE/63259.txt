TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in aorta and CD115+ isolated circulating cells from apoE-/- versus apoE-/-LTbR-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Microarrays were used to analyse gene expression in aortas and circulating CD115+ cells of ApoE- and ApoE/Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbR)-double-deficent mice fed a Western diet from 8 to 12 weeks of age in order to identify regulated genes and pathways leading to reduced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/-/LTbR-/- mice compared to ApoE-/- littermate controls.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analysed in aorta and CD115+ circulating blood cells in ApoE-and ApoE/LTbR-double deficient mice after 4 weeks feeding a high-fat, high-cholesterol Western type diet.
