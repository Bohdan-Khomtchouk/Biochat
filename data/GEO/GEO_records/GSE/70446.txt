TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse uterine decidua isolated on morning of day 8 of pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Placenta development involves complex molecular and cellular interactions between the maternal endometrium and the developing embryo, however, it is not clear what are the precise mechanisms regulating this maternal-fetal crosstalk. Using genetic and cell biological approaches, we have demonstrated that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a maternal factor expressed in decidual cells and is markedly elevated in mouse decidua on days 7 and 8 of gestation, regulates the secretory pathways that mediate stromal-endothelial and stromal-trophoblast crosstalk within a narrow temporal window during placenta development. Our study revealed that ablation of Rac1 did not affect the formation of the decidua but led to fetal loss in mid gestation accompanied by extensive hemorrhage. To gain insights into the molecular pathways affected by the loss of Rac1, we performed gene expression profiling which revealed that RAC1 signaling regulates the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and vesicle trafficking. Consequently, the Rac1-null decidual cells exhibited impaired secretory functions that led to poor vascularization of the uterus and abnormal trophoblast expansion and placentation.

DESIGN
Mouse uterine decidual masses were isolated from control and conditional knockout mice on the morning of day 8 of pregnancy. The decidual masses, from 3 animals/genotype, were pooled and total RNA was isolated and then hybridized to high density affymetrix microarrays according to the Affymetrix protocol (Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array)
