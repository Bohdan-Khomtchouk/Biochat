TITLE
Transcriptional response of E. coli to TPEN

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were used to probe the transcriptional response of E. coli to N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). Fifty-five transcripts were significantly up-regulated including all of the genes that are regulated by Zur and many genes regulated by Fur.  In these same TPEN-treated cells, forty-six transcripts were significantly down-regulated. Keywords: E. coli, TPEN, zinc
