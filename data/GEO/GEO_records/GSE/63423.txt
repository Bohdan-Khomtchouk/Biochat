TITLE
Influence of muscle activity on paralyzed muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the short and long term effects of electrically induced exercise on mRNA expression of human paralyzed muscle. We developed an exercise dose that activated the muscle for 0.6% of the day. The short term effects were assessed 3 hours after a single dose of exercise, while the long term effects were assessed after training 5 days per week for at least one year (adherence 81%). A single dose of electrical stimulation increased the mRNA expression of transcriptional, translational, and enzyme regulators of metabolism important to shift muscle toward an oxidative phenotype (PGC-1a, NR4A3, IFRD1, ABRA, PDK4). However, chronic training increased the mRNA expression of specific metabolic pathway genes (BRP44, BRP44L, SDHB, ACADVL), mitochondrial fission and fusion genes (MFF, MFN1, MFN2), and slow muscle fiber genes (MYH6, MYH7, MYL3, MYL2).Furthermore, regulating these same pathways may be critical to developing efficient activity protocols to reduce the prevalence of diabetes in people with longstanding paralysis from SCI.

DESIGN
We analyzed skeletal muscle using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Partek Genomic Suites.
