TITLE
Expression data from adult NSCs/neural progenitors with and without active SIRT1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess gene expression differences between proliferating adult NSCs/neural progenitors with and without active SIRT1.

DESIGN
Adult NSCs/neural progenitors were isolated from 8 week old Sirt1lox/lox and NestinCre;Sirt1lox/lox mice (129SV strain), cultured for one passage in growth factors (EGF and bFGF) before isolation at early passage 2 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Gene expression data were adjusted for background and normalized using RMA.
