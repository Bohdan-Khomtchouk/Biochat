TITLE
Microarray profiling of rats treated for 21 days with haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg/d), risperidone (5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
SD rats were dosed with gold standard antipsychotic therapies, haloperidol or risperidone, at doses aimed at achieving therapeutically relevant drug exposures.  Tissues were collected after 21 days of delivery to examine the impact of this treatment on gene expression in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum.

DESIGN
n=5 per group.  Rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps at 9-11 weeks of age, prepared with compound or vehicle.  Tissue was collected after 21 days of constant drug delivery.
