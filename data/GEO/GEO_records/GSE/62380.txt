TITLE
Chromatin profiling reveals novel proteins associated with histone-marked genomic regions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our understanding of the functions of DNA elements is limited by the paucity of information about the spectrum of proteins that occupy these genomic regions. Here we describe an approach to identify proteins associated with genomic regions whose chromatin is marked by specific modified histones, which we term chromatin profiling. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) to identify proteins associated with genomic regions marked by histone H3K27Ac, H3K4me3, H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. We identified 385 known and 224 novel candidate proteins associated with these histone-marked genomic segments and confirmed that several of the novel candidates are indeed associated with histone-marked segments of the genome. Future study of the novel candidates, many of which have been implicated in various diseases, should lead to an improved understanding of gene control and its dysregulation in disease.
