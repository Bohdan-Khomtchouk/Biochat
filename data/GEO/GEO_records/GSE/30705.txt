TITLE
Budding yeast mRNA export and processing factor localization

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The yeast mRNA export adaptor Yra1 binds the Pcf11 subunit of cleavage-polyadenylation factor CF1A linking export to 3'-end formation. We found a surprising consequence of this interaction is that Yra1 influences cleavage-polyadenylation. Yra1 competes with the CF1A subunit, Clp1, for binding to Pcf11, and excess Yra1 inhibits 3' processing in vitro. Release of Yra1 at the 3' ends of genes coincides with recruitment of Clp1, and depletion of Yra1 enhances Clp1 recruitment within some genes. These results suggest that CF1A is not necessarily recruited as a complete unit, but instead Clp1 can be incorporated co-transcriptionally in a process regulated by Yra1. Yra1 depletion causes widespread changes in poly(A) site choice particularly at sites where the efficiency element is divergently positioned. We propose that one way Yra1 modulates cleavage-polyadenylation is by influencing co-transcriptional assembly of the CF1A/B 3' processing factor.
