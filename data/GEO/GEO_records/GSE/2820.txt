TITLE
Gene expression profiling in FSHMD1A muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a muscle specific cDNA microarray platform to analyze muscle biopsies of 11 characterized FSHD patients, carrying a variable number of KpnI repeats. Keywords: FSHD, cDNA microarray, gene expression profiling, deltoid muscle

DESIGN
Our muscle specific cDNA microarray platform was used to analyze muscle biopsies of a series of genetically characterized FSHD patients with a range of D4Z4 allele size at the contracted 4qter region and with canonical phenotypes of varying grades of clinical severity. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the distal portion of the left deltoideus muscle. In this study we compared by competitive microarray hybridization the transcription profiles of FSHMD1A muscles with a pool of 10 human deltoideous muscles obtained from normal donors.
