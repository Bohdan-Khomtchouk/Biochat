TITLE
Expression data from mouse perigonadal white adipose tissue - various mutant conditions [gene-level analysis]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progerin-expressing mice (HGPS-like) demonstrated increased energy metabolism and lipodystrophy. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis was found in adipose tissue from HGPS-like mice, whereas lamin C-only mice had fewer mitochondria. Thus we analyse which molecular pathways mediated the changes in adipose tissue caused by lamin C and progerin expression and the roles of these pathways in energy metabolism and aging.

DESIGN
10 cDNAs samples were analysed. We compared the mean fold change of 2 to 4 biological replicates. We performed an unpaired Student’s t-test to compare intensities in the different biological replicates. Genes were considered significantly regulated when the fold change was ≥ 1.5, and the p-value was ≤0.05.
