TITLE
Expression data from different photosynthetic rate in Populus.

ORGANISM
(Populus alba x Populus glandulosa) x Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
Despite the significance of nucleus genes in plant growth and development, little is known of the molecular bases of regulation of photosynthesis in woody plants.Hence discovering the genetic basis for photosynthesis related phenotypic variation and identifying the major genes controlling these complex traits in trees is essential. Combining the microarray technique and bulked segregant analysis strategy, we used poplar as a model to detect the nucleus genes differentially expressed in segregation population of photosynthesis traits. We measured the F1 interspecific population and segregated the stable extrem samples into two groups including three pools containing five incividuals.Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in different photosynthetic rate.

DESIGN
Leaves were taken from high and low  photosynthetic rate individuals for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. H_A, H_B, H_C are from the high photosynthetic rate individuals. L_D,L_E, L_F are from the low photosynthetic rate incividuals.
