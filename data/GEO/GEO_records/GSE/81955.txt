TITLE
Analysis of polysomal enrichment and depletion of mRNA in untreated and TGF-beta treated MCF-10A and MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed sucrose-gradient-based isolation of polysomal fractions from untreated and TGF-beta treated MCF-10A and MCF7 cells, subjected these fractions to RNA-seq, and also sequenced total mRNA from each cell line in the treated and untreated condition

DESIGN
Examination of two different cell types in a treated and untreated state
