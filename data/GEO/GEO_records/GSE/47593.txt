TITLE
Large numbers of putative miRNAs originate from DNA transposons and are coincident with a large species radiation in bats.

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris ; Equus caballus ; Eptesicus fuscus

SUMMARY
Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 mya that resulted in the second most species rich mammalian family.  Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present.  Deep sequencing of small RNAs from the vespertilionid, Eptesicus fuscus, as well as dog and horse revealed that substantial numbers of novel bat miRNAs are derived from DNA transposons unique to vespertilionids.  In fact, 35.9% of Eptesicus-specific miRNAs derive from DNA transposons compared to 2.2 and 5.9% of dog- and horse-specific miRNAs, respectively and targets of several miRNAs are identifiable.  Timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the introduction of novel miRNAs coincides remarkably well with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. We suggest that the rapid and repeated perturbation of regulatory networks by the introduction of many novel miRNA loci was a factor in the rapid radiation.

DESIGN
A testicular tissue sample from dog, horse, and two different Eptesicus fuscus individuals. Four samples total.
