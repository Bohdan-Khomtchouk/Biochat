TITLE
JA-Ile coordinates anthesis and floral attractants in wild tobacco through COI1 dependent and independent mechanisms.

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of coronatine/jasmonoyl-isoleucine-regulated transcripts and encoded metabolic processes in late stages of Nicotiana attenuata flower development.

DESIGN
Floral buds at 4 DAP (4 days after corolla protruded and appeared outside sepals) of ir-aoc (silenced for ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE)- treated with ctrl (control) or 1ÂµM COR (coronatine) solution - were harvested on the morning before flowers would open. Flowers were dissected and 3 biological replicates of each tissue (complete corolla, style and gynoecium tissues) were collected. Individual replicates were obtained from 20+ flowers of each 2 plants. cDNA synthesized from extracted RNA pools were combined with an equal contribution of each tissue types. Microarray data (3 replicates obtained from 3 independently produced pools of cDNA) were 75-percentile normalized and analyzed using significance analysis of microarray (SAM, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR threshold of 5%) for differentially regulated genes between ctrl- and COR-treated flowers Significantly overrepresented GO categories were identified using the BINGO plugin for Cytoscape. A P-value significance for each differentially regulated gene was calculated using a hypergeometric test with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction. P < 0.05 was used as threshold for significantly enriched GO categories.
