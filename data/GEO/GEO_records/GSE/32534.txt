TITLE
Expression data of FFPE peritumoral neocortex tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epilepsy is a common cause of morbidity affecting approximately one third of patients with primary brain tumors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the tumor induced epileptogenesis is poorly understood. The alteration in peritumoral microenvironments is believed to play a significant role in inducing epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that the change of gene expression in neighboring astrocytes and neurons may contribute to the increased neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 arrays and RNAs derived from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) peritumoral cortex tissue slides from 5-paired (seizure vs. non-seizure) low grade brain tumor patients.
