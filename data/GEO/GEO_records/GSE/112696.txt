TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and T cells from patients with myasthenia gravis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We quantified different methylcytosine genes in CD4+T cells from patients with MG and healthy controls using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Assays. Cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood of 6 MG patients and 6 healthy donors.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 12 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
