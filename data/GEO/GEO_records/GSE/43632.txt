TITLE
Large scale screening for fusion genes in sarcoma patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have utilized our custom array GPL11054 to screen a set of sarcoma patient samples for fusion genes One negative control was included in the study.

DESIGN
We wanted to investigate the power of our fusion-gene array GPL11054 as a means for fusion gene detection in a series of sarcoma patient samples from two diagnostic laboratories with expertise in fusion gene detection.

PLATFORM
GPL11054 Fusion gene microarray, human, 500k, v.2.0.
