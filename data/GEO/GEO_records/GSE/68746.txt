TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) comparison of two MVT1 cells subpopulations, CD24- cells and CD24+ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome of the 2 MVT1 subpopulations in order to identify new genes and pathways that stands beyond the CD24+ aggressive phenotype

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of CD24- and CD24+ cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500
