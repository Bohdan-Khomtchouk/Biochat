TITLE
regulatory T cells in human pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transplacental immune programming refers to the concept that during  pregnancy, significant crosstalk occurs between the maternal and fetal immune  system, with consequent long‐term effects especially for the offspring. In this  study, we searched for evidence of transplacental programming in cellular  immunity. We made the surprising observation that there is a stringent and  specific correlation of regulatory T cells (Treg) between the mother and the  fetus. Gene microarray analysis indicates that interleukin 10 (IL‐10) might be  involved in transplacental Treg alignment. This is further supported by the direct  correlation of IL‐10 at a protein level between maternal fetal dyads. In vitro data  provide evidence that IL‐10 may regulate the homeostatic balance between  Tregs and non‐Tregs through selective upregulation of the anti‐apoptotic  molecule Bcl‐2 in Tregs. Induction of IL‐10 might be triggered by fetus‐derived  estriol (E3), which readily crosses the placenta and correlates with maternal IL‐  10 levels. Our study represents the first example of transplacental regulation of  cellular immunity between the mother and the fetus. These novel findings might  have major implications for pregnancy related‐changes in the maternal and fetal  immune system, and provide possible mechanistic insights into how prenatal  influences can lead to subsequent immunopathologies, such as allergy and  autoimmunity.

DESIGN
T-reg and non-Treg samples of non pregnant women, and matched cord blood and maternal blood T-regs and non-T-regs
