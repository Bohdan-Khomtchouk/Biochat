TITLE
Gene expression sensitivity at detecting cancer in prostate core biopsies [Expression Profiles]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze critically the potential usefulness of selected RNA biomarkers in supporting conventional histological diagnostic tests for PCa. The selection of potential biomarkers was conducted by microarray profiling of gene expression on prostate tissues extracted from the gland after total radical prostatectomy.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 16 prostate samples without carcinoma and 16 matched pairs of samples with and without cancer cells isolated from prostates containing prostate carcinoma

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
