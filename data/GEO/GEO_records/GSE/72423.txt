TITLE
Systematic identification of changes in the yeast protein interaction network in response to environmental, chemical, and genetic perturbation [transcriptome data]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To understand the principles underlying protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex changes in response to external perturbations, we created a highly multiplexed version of the murine dihydrofolate reductase protein complementation assay (mDHFR PCA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing quantitative PPI complex profiling in vivo. We investigated the effects of 14 different conditions (including small molecules, abiotic stress factors, and nutrient composition) on a total of 1383 PPIs. More than half of PPIs (758) were found to be variable, and their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were found to be informative of both the nature of the perturbation within each condition, as well as the overall variability of the interactions across conditions. Many perturbations triggered network changes characterized by large connected modules centered around highly connected proteins ('hubs'), suggesting that cellular control of a few proteins (e.g., by mRNA levels) can induce widespread PPI remodeling. Under a diauxic shift from glucose to ethanol as the main carbon source, we found a striking relationship between PPI changes measured by our assay and those predicted by mRNA expression under a simple law of mass action based model.

DESIGN
We chose to investigate the relationship between interactome and transcriptome changes in the shift from glucose to ethanol as the sole carbon source. To obtain relative mRNA expression data in our pool, cells were grown in selective media supplemented with dextrose as a pre-culture and then shifted to selective media containing ethanol as the sole carbon source, with samples taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 4, and 12 hours after the transfer.
