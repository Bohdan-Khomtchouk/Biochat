TITLE
A microRNA-based primary tumor site classification of liver core biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To develop a classifier based on microRNAs for primary tumor site identification of liver core biopsies and to explore the influence of surrounding normal liver tissue on classification.

DESIGN
Tissue samples from 333 patients, corresponding to one of the following ten assay classes, were obtained from archives of the pathology department, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark: Lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric/cardia cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, squamous cell cancers of different origin, and normal liver tissue
