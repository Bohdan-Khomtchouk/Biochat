TITLE
STAT1 transcription factor in Human HeLa S3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation following by high-thoughput tag sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using the GA II platform from Illumina for the human transcription factor STAT1 in HeLa S3 cells. The STAT1 ChIP was performed using HeLa S3 cells that are stimulated using gamma-interferon. We have also generated a seqenced input DNA dataset for gamma-interferon stimulated HeLa S3 cells. Raw data for this study is available for download from the Short Read Archive database at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?study=SRP000703.
