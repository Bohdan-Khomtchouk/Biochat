TITLE
Network and pathway microarray expression analysis of cardiac-specific estrogen receptor alpha knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor alpha function in the heart at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that absence of estrogen receptor alpha may induce cardiometabolic alterations. Results provide information of the responses to the absence of Estrogen receptor alpha such as core pathways that are affected, up- or down-regulated specific  metabolic functions.

DESIGN
Cardiac RNA isolated from 18 weeks old mice heart, both males and female cardiac-specific estrogen receptor alpha knockout mice compared to their corresponding age and sex matched controls.
