TITLE
GABAB-R evoked changes in mRNA transcription

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Aim: To gain insight into the pathways by which GABABR activation may influence long-term changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth and morphology we investigated changes in gene expression in cultured hippocampal neurones evoked by the GABABR agonist baclofen.  We used cDNA microarray gene expression profiling to identify candidate genes that are differentially expressed in the hippocampal neurones following GABABR activation. Experimental design:	The cDNA microarray used in the present study is the NIA Neuroarray containing 1152 genes relevant to neurobiology. NIA Neuroarray probes were hybridised in triplicate with targets derived from control and baclofen-treated neurones. Conclusion: Our novel data on down-stream, late phase consequences of GABABR signalling provide a basis for future studies to investigate these changes in gene expression at the protein, cell biology and functional levels.  Furthermore, the changes in gene expression identified will shed light on the multiple roles of GABABRs. Keywords: repeat sample
