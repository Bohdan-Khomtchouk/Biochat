TITLE
Potato tuber development

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
An in vivo and in vitro potato tuber development gene expression study. Keywords: Developmental stage analysis, time course

DESIGN
For in vitro tuber development expression analysis, RNA was isolated from in vitro microtubers at 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 days following observed tuber induction. Two microtuber populations were used as biological replicates for the developmental stages. The RNA from all developmental stages was pooled to generate the reference samples. Ten microarray hybridizations were performed. For in vivo tuber development expression analysis, RNA was isolated from tubers growing in growth chamber conditions. Tissues were divided into six group, according to developmental size: stolon (no tuber formation), 1-5 mm tubers, 6-10 mm tubers, 11-15 mm tubers, 16-25 mm tubers, and 26-35 mm tubers. Two biological replicates of ten plants each were grown sequentially in the same growth chamber. The RNA from all developmental stages was pooled to generate the reference samples. Twelve microarray hybridizations were performed. For all experiments, the RNA was labeled using the indirect labeling method with random hexamer primers. Amplified cRNA was used as labeling template for stolons. Total RNA was used as labeling template in all other labeling reactions.
