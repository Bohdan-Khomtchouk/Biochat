TITLE
Digital Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) At 24 Hours Post Hantaavirus Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hantavirus infection causing zoonotic diseases with a high mortality rate in humans has long been a global public health concern. Over the past decades, accumulating evidences suggest that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in innate immunity. However, the involvement of host lncRNAs in hantaviral control remains uncharacterized. To explore the potential role of long non-coding RNAs in host innate immune responses, DGE analysis of HUVECs for whole genome profiling was performed at 24 hours post HTNV infection.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from HUVECs, which were either mock infected or treated with live or Co60-inactivated HTNV at MOI 1 for 24 hours, was sequenced on an Illumina Platform. More than 3.4 million reads per sample were obtained. One sample in the Mock, HTNV infection or Co60-inactivated HTNV infection group were collected for DGE. No replicates were applied in each group.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
