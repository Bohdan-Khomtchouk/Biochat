TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of breast-milk isolated total somatic cells from women with mastitis following the consumption of a probiotic containing a Lactobacillus salivarius PS2 strain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in somatic cells from breast-milk extracted from women suffering from mastitis and taking a daily dose of three capsules with ~50 mg of a freeze-dried probiotic (~109 CFU of L. salivarius PS2 strain) for 21 days. Healthy women were subjected to the same treatment for comparison.

DESIGN
The aim of this work was to determine whether the daily intake of a probiotic strain for a total of 21 days exerted any modulatory effects, at the level of gene expression, in somatic cells from breast-milk in women with mastitis. Women were divided into 2 groups: mastitis and healthy. Total RNA was extracted from breast-milk isolated cells obtained from 10 participants (7 women from the mastitis group and 3 women from the healthy group) at day 0 (initial) and after 21 days (final) to compare differential gene expression between the groups. Differential gene expression after 21 days of the study for each group: mastitis and healthy
