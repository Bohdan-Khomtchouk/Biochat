Transcritome analysis of herbal extract WCE mediated gene signature in 22Rv1 cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Recurrences of hormone-refractory prostate cancer highly affect the therapeutic outcome. Although anti-androgen therapy prolongs survival in prostate cancer patients, resistance rapidly develops and is often associated with increased androgen receptor expression and upregulated HER2/3-AKT signaling pathway. However, single agent therapy targeting AR, HER2/3 or AKT usually failed due to the reciprocal feedback loop. Here, we demonstrated that herbal extract of Wedelia chinensis (WCE) effectively disrupted the androgen receptor, HER2/3, and AKT signaling network and therefore enhanced therapeutic efficacy of androgen ablation in PCa.

DESIGN
To further study WCE effect, 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were treated by vehicle control or 10 Î¼g/mL of WCE for 16 hr. Total RNA expressions were analyzed in cDNA microarray.
