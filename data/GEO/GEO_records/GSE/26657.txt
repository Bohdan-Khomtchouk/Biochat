TITLE
ChIP-Seq data for histone marks in mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) by forced expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 is among the earliest demonstrations of reprogramming to a pluripotent state by forced expression of transcription factors. To gain insights into the chromatin state of genes required for reprogramming, we profiled H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. Sample GSM555166 (GSE22320) was used as the negative control for the MEF cells, and Samples GSM602780 and GSM602781 (GSE24471) were used as the negative controls for the secondary fibroblasts.

PLATFORM
