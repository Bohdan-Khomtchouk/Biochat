TITLE
Comparison of HEK293T cells grown in serum supplemented media to cells serum starved for 3 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293T cells grown to confluence in media +10% fetal bovine serume.  Media was removed and replaced with serum free media, and cultured for 3 days.  RNA was harvested from day0 (serum supplemented), control, and day3 (serum starved) cultures, experiment.

DESIGN
The analysis compared RNAs from serum supplemented cultures to cultures grown in serum free media for 3 days.  Each array was hybridized to a day0 sample and a day3 serum starved sample.  There are a total of four arrays with 2 arrays each for dye swap.
