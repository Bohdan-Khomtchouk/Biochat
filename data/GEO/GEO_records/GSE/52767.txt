TITLE
Gene expression profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed between murine MHCIIlo and MHCIIhi dendritic cell subpopulations [LPS stimulation]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic progenitors from mouse bone marrow were differentiated into dendritic cells for 5 days with GM-CSF and IL-4. On day 6, MHCIIhi and MHCIIlo BMDC subpopulations were sorted to purify by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted and processed for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment; Biological replicates: 5 replicates per condition.
