TITLE
Retroviral mutagenesis in haploid ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retroviral integration sites were mapped using inverse PCR to assess preferred integration sites of this virus in the genome after infection with the retrovirus and its impact on gene expression.

DESIGN
Inverse PCR was applied on genomic DNA to identify retroviral integration sites. Inverse PCR allows to identify multiple genomic insertions of a gene trap virus in parallel.
