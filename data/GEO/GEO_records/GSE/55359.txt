TITLE
Expression data from rhesus macaque jejunum

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The mucosa that lines the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts is an important portal of entry for pathogens and provides the frontline of immune defense against HIV infection. Epithelial barrier dysfunction during HIV infection has largely been attributed to the rapid and severe depletion of CD4 T cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, the poential role of small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) to contribute to epithelial dysfunction was investigated in the non-human primate SIV model and microarrays were utilized to determine changes in mucosal gene expression (non-miRNA) that could be correlated to  miRNA modulatiolns. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the jejunal mucosa that occur during chronic SIV infection

DESIGN
Jejunum tissues from healthy uninfected macaques and macaques with chronic stage SIV infection were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
