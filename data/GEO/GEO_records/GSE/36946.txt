TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling of Surgical Myectomy Tissue from Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a high-throughput gene expression profiling technology, we have illuminated novel potential microRNA (miRNA) components of the molecular disease process underlying human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  It is hoped that this will fuel future research endeavors that will eventually uncover the role miRNAs may play in the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease, and thus, provide potential tools for identifying patients with benign versus malignant forms of the disease.

DESIGN
Case (n = 107)-Control (n=20) study comparing the microRNA transcriptome of cardiac tissues from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to the microRNA transcriptome of control donor cardiac tissues.

PLATFORM
GPL8179 Illumina Human v2 MicroRNA expression beadchip
