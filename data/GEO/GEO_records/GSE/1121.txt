TITLE
changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift. All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose. Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com). The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image. All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
