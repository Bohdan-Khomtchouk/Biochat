TITLE
Gene expression in 501mel melanoma cells treated with Salubrinal.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The primary cause of cancer deaths is metastasis. While studies have identified multiple signals that drive invasiveness, the first step in metastatic colonisation, the reason for cells to move away from the primary tumor is less well understood. Salubrinal inhibits an eIF2-alpha phosphatase and consequently leads to increase eIF2-alpha phosphorylation and inhibition of the eIF2B translation initiation factor, leading to reprogramming of translation. The dataset presented examines the effect of Salubrinal on gene expression over time in the 501mel melanoma cell line compared to control DMSO treated cells. The results were used to generate a gene expression signature that correlates with invasiveness, and the â€˜Innate Anti-PD-1 therapy resistance signature'.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted in triplicate from untreated 501mel cells or collected 12, 24, 48 or 72 hours after treatment with Salubrinal (20 mM).
