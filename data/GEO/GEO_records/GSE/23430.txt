TITLE
Differential expression of miRNA in control and CD3/CD28mAb-treated Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cultured cell line Jurkat is frequently employed in studies of T cell function. Here we identified the microRNAs expressed in Jurkat cells in the presence and absence of CD3/CD28mAb treatment.
