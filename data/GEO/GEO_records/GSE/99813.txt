TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 array data for PAX5 amplified acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intragenic PAX5 amplification in < 1%of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.  Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array analysis was undertaken in patients who showed amplication of PAX5 by MLPA testing using the P335-IKZF1 MLPA kit (www.mlpa.com, MRC Holland, The Netherlands)

DESIGN
We performed Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array on genomic DNA extracted from bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis in 7 patients and at relapse in one patient.

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
