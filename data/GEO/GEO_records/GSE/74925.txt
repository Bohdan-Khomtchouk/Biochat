TITLE
eQTL in HBV-related liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
31 non-tumor liver tissues from 31 HBV-related HCC patients

DESIGN
We performed correlation analyses between the SNPs genotypes and the mRNA expression levels to evaluate whether a SNP serves as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) with putative cis regulatory effects on gene expression traits in liver tissues. The intensity of all gene array experiments were normalized together using the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) method. This submission represents mRNA expression component of study.
