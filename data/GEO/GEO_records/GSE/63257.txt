TITLE
Subtype Specific Addiction of the Activated B Cell Subset of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma to FOXP1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide transcript and target gene profiling reveal that FOXP1 acts directly and indirectly by enforcing known ABC-DLBCL hallmarks, including Chronically Activated B cell receptor Signaling (CABS) and the classical NF-ÎºB survival pathway. Our data further suggest that FOXP1 maintains ABC-subtype distinction by repressing gene expression programs dominant in GCB-DLBCL and support a model in which the normally transitory B cell plasmablast is the target of ABC-DLBCL transformation.

DESIGN
ChIP sequenicng was performed for the FOXP1 transcription factor in DLBCL cell lines. Input was sequenced and used as a control.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
