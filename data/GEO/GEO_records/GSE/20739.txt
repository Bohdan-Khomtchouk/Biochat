TITLE
Gene expression analysis of miR-663 knockdown under shear stress in HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms by which oscillatory shear (OS) induces, while high laminar shear stress (LS) prevents, atherosclerosis are still unclear. Here, we examined the hypothesis that OS induces inflammatory response, a critical atherogenic event, in endothelial cells by a miRNA-dependent mechanism. In particular, miR-663 mediated OS-induced inflammation through monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The potential targets of miR-663 were examined by knockdown of miR-663 and then the gene expression profiles were determined under shear stress conditions.

DESIGN
To determine the potential targets of miR-663, HUVEC were transfected either with miR-663-LNA (inhibitor of miR-663) or control-LNA and then subjected to OS or LS for 24hr. Total RNA were collected from these four groups and microarray studies (Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 beadchip) were performed.
