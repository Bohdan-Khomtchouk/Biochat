TITLE
Time-course effect of estradiol and estradiol-BSA on early gene expression in T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogens have been reported to activate several processes via membrane binding to either classic estrogen receptors (ERs) or GPR30. We have used either estradiol or BSA-conjugated estradiol in order to initiate membrane-initiated actions and ICI 172,780 (ICI) or G15 to explore ER- and GPR30-related transcription. Our results show that the majority of G15-inhibited transcription is depending on ERs, as it is also inhibited by ICI. However, a small number of transcripts, related to specific actions/pathways is either exclusively inhibited by G15, providing evidence about a specific GPR30 signature, or not inhibited by ICI or G15 suggesting the existence of another, yet unidentified estrogen receptor.

DESIGN
Cells after a 4h incubation with medium containing 10% charcoal stripped FBS were incubated with or without E2-BSA (10-6M) in the presence or absence of specific antagonists, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped FBS, for 3 hours. Total RNA was isolated using Nucleospin II columns (Macheray-Nagel, Dttren, Germany), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. RNA was labeled and hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (Affymetrix Gene-Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual), using the HGU133A plus 2 chip, analyzing a total of 54675 transcripts. Signals were detected by an Affymetrix microarray chip reader.
