TITLE
ChIP-chip of CBP/p300 in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: CBP/p300 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM386269..GSM386277]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM386279..GSM386287]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM418309..GSM418317]: ChIP-chip of CBP in adult female Drosophila [GSM418318..GSM418326]: ChIP-chip of CBP in adult male Drosophila [GSM418335..GSM418343]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM418454..GSM418462]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila L3 larvae [GSM418463..GSM418471]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila pupae [GSM442425..GSM442433]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM443119..GSM443127]: ChIP-chip of CBP in Drosophila L1 larvae For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
