TITLE
Changes in Expression of Genes Involved in Apoptosis in Activated Human T-Cells in Response to Modeled  Microgravity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to search for microgravity-sensitive genes, specifically for apoptotic genes influenced by the microgravity environment and other genes related to immune response. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Two-group design with paired samples, i.e., one 1G and one MMG culture came from the same donor.  Therefore, 6 samples came from 3 different donors. Donor 1 :GSM96146,GSM96147 Donor 2: GSM96148, GSM96149 Donor 3: GSM96150,GSM96151 Total RNA was submitted to, and then labeled, hybridized and data generated by the Baylor College Medicine Microarray Core Facility (333E One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030).
