TITLE
The CBF1/L3MBTL3 axis promotes the repression of Notch signaling by the histone demethylase KDM1A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq experiments to investigate on a genome-wide scale the co-localization of CBF1 (also known as RBPJ or CSL) and L3MBTL3 on chromatin in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Analysis of the CBF1 and L3MBTL3 ChIP-seq experiments in the MDA-MB-231 cell line revealed a substantial and significant genome-wide co-localization on chromatin, in agreement with our hypothesis that CBF1 contributes to the recruitment of L3MBTL3 to chromatin.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiments to investigate the co-localization of CBF1 and L3MBTL3 on chromatin in the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
