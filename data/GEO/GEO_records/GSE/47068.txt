TITLE
Rat Life Cycle Kidney Male Gene Expression Data

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The kidney is important for a number of physiological processes including blood filtering, blood pressure regulation and proper excretion of many drugs and xenobiotics. Age is a predisposing condition for susceptibility to chronic kidney disease and progression as well as acute kidney injury that may arise due to the adverse effects of some drugs. Age-related differences in kidney biology, therefore, are a key concern in understanding drug safety and disease progression.  We hypothesize that the underlying suite of genes expressed in the kidney at various life cycle stages will impact susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Therefore, establishing changes in baseline expression data between these life stages is the first and necessary step in evaluating this hypothesis.

DESIGN
Untreated male F344 rats from 2, 5, 6, 8, 15, 21, 78, and 104 weeks of age (n=5) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, whole kidneys collected and homogenized, total RNA used for whole genome expression arrays (Agilent).
