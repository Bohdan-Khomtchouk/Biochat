TITLE
Mtb-mediated host transcriptional reponse is strain-specific

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CDC1551 induced more vigorous immune response in murine bone marrow derived macrophage (BMM). In contrast, in HN878-infected cells, host transcriptional response was delayed but lasted longer. HN878 induced more genes involved in host lipid metabolism than CDC1551 did.

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow derived macrophages were infected with M. tuberculosis CDC1551 or HN878 up to 24 h.  Total RNA was processed for microarray and global gene expression was read.
