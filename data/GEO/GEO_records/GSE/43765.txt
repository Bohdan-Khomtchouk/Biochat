TITLE
Expression data from exponentially proliferating ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess gene expression in proliferating ovarian cancer cell lines

DESIGN
Ovarian cancer cell lines were plated and harvested when 50-80% confluent.    RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. At least 3 biological repeats were performed for each cell line.
