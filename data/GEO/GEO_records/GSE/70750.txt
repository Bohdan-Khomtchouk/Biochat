TITLE
Gene expression in zebrafish following knockdown of pitx2 or tbx5

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Key regulators of septum formation between the left and right ventricle in mammals, including the transcription factors TXB5 and PITX2, feature loss-of-function phenotypes that affect development of the two-chambered zebrafish heart, suggesting uncharacterized primordial functions of these septation regulators prior to the evolution of any physical boundaries between heart chambers. Data is as published in Mosimann & Panakova et al (Nature Communications, 2015)

DESIGN
Samples for tbx5a versus pitx2ab MO comparison were collected from three independent experiments of MO-injected siblings and uninjected wildtype controls at 56hpf by morphology.
