TITLE
The gene expression of normal pancreatic and PDAC tisssues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 8 normal pancreatic and 14 PDAC tissues. Data was generated from Affymetrix arrays. Results provide a global profile of over 50,000 genes in normal and tumorous tissues, and comparison of the differentially expressed genes between the normal and tumor groups.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled and compared between normal pancreatic and PDAC RNA samples globally, using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0array.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
