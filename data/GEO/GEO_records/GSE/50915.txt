TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Drosophila melanogaster heads from experimentally-evolved populations

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptomes of male and female heads from experimentally-evolved D. melanogaster populations after 117 generations of mating system manipulation in order to examine the pattern of evolution in sex-biased genes.

DESIGN
Examined head transcriptomes of 3 monogamous populations and 3 polygamous populations, both males and females, for 12 total samples.

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
