TITLE
Motor phenotypes and molecular networks associated with germline  deficiency of Ciz1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A Ciz1 gene-trap knock-out (KO) mouse model was generated to examine the functional role(s) of Ciz1 in the sensorimotor nervous system and contributions of Ciz1 to cell-cycle control in the mammalian brain. Ciz1 transcripts were absent in Ciz1-/- mice and reduced by approximately 50% in Ciz1+/- mice

DESIGN
Total RNA harvested from cerebellum of 6-10-month old Ciz1-/- and 6 age and gender matched WT mice were used for wholegenome gene expression analysis

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
