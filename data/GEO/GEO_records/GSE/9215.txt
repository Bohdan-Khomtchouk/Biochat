TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of  BCR-triggered immature and mature mouse B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a signaling complex that mediates differentiation stage-specific cell fate decisions in B lymphocytes. While several studies have evidenced differences in signal transduction components as being key to contrasting phenotypic outcomes, little is known about the differential BCR-triggered gene transcription. Here we defined transcriptional changes underlying BCR-induced apoptosis and proliferation of immature and mature B cells, respectively. These findings provide the first insights into the early transcriptional events leading to deletion or clonal expansion of B cells upon antigen recognition. Keywords: cell type comparison, development or differentiation design, time course, compound treatment design, microarray experiment record

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from immature (IM) and mature (M) B cells both freshly isolated (0h) and stimulated with (BCR) or without (ctrl) anti-μ F(ab’)2 for 2, 8 or 24h. Following RNA extraction, one round of mRNA amplification was applied using the MessageAmpTM Kit (Ambion). All samples, including the amplified Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene) which served as a reference at each hybridization, were reverse-transcribed and indirectly labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham). Quality was controlled by performing 6 or 8 hybridizations of each sample to the cDNA arrays using a dye-swap strategy. 94 arrays were used for hybridization in total.
