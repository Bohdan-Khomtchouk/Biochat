TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of  BCR-triggered immature and mature mouse B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a signaling complex that mediates differentiation stage-specific cell fate decisions in B lymphocytes. While several studies have evidenced differences in signal transduction components as being key to contrasting phenotypic outcomes, little is known about the differential BCR-triggered gene transcription. Here we defined transcriptional changes underlying BCR-induced apoptosis and proliferation of immature and mature B cells, respectively. These findings provide the first insights into the early transcriptional events leading to deletion or clonal expansion of B cells upon antigen recognition. Keywords: cell type comparison, development or differentiation design, time course, compound treatment design, microarray experiment record
