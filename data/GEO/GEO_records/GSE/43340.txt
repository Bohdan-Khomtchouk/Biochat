TITLE
Hypoxia-induced miR-210 modulates gene expression in response to acute peripheral ischemia.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peripheral Artery Disease is caused by the restriction or occlusion of arteries supplying the leg. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning tissue response to acute and chronic ischemia is urgently needed to improve therapeutic options. The aim of this study is understanding miR-210 regulation and role in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia.

DESIGN
To investigate miR-210 function, mice were injected with a miR-210 complementary LNA-oligonucleotide (anti-miR-210). Then, the left femoral artery was dissected in order to induce unilateral hindlimb ischemia. Mice were sacrified 3 days later and gene expression profiles of gastrocnemius muscles were obatained.
