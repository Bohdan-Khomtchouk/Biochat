TITLE
The effect of MPO inhibitor on the gene expression profiles in HL-60 cell lines exposed to 1, 2, 4,-benzenetriol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal the gene expression profile changes after exposure to BT, one of benzene metabolites, with or without ABAH, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor, and to elucidate how MPO is involved in myelotoxicity of BT, we performed microarray analysis. HL-60 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 containing with 10% of heat-inactivated FBS at 4×10^5/ mL were incubated with or without BT (50 μM) at 37℃ for one or 4 hours. For MPO inhibition experiment, HL-60 (4×10^5 cells/ mL) were pretreatment with 100 μM of ABAH in RPMI 1640/10% of heat-inactivated FBS at 37℃ for 24 hours. Media was then replaced with new media containing the regent plus BT (50 μM) and incubate at 37℃ for one or 4 hours. Unexposed HL-60 cells were used as controls. To validate the microarray results, we selected 22 genes and conducted a real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Gene expression alteration induced by 50 μM of BT in HL-60 cells, with or without ABAH, was measured at 1 and 4 hours after exposure to it. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (1 or 4 hours).
