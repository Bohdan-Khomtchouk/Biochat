TITLE
Chromatin interaction analysis of transcription factors and NLRP3 in CD4+ T cells differentiated from wild-type and NLRP3KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that the NLRP3 protein is able to interact with chromatin during Th2 differentiation

DESIGN
Examination of the interaction of NLRP3 and transcription factors during early stages of Th2 CD4+ T cell differentiation
