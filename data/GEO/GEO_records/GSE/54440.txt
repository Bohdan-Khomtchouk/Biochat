TITLE
Genome wide analysis of transcriptome wild type and JIL-1 mutant [RNA-seq: 4 samples]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Comparison of global transcription profiles in salivary glands from wild-type and JIL-1 null mutant larvae revealed that the expression levels of 1539 genes changed at least two-fold in the mutant and that a substantial number (49%) of these genes were upregulated whereas 51% were downregulated.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different transcriptome  in 2 genotypes with two replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
