TITLE
DNA Methylation Dynamics in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells over Time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined genome-wide DNA methylation with 22 human iPSC lines derived from different cell types and human ESC lines using Illuminaâ€™s Infinium HumanMethylation27 and focused on aberrant methylation sites in iPSCs for up to 42-week continuous cultivation. The iPSCs exhibited distinct epigenetic distances from ESCs at early passage. Continuous passaging of the iPSCs diminishes these differences between iPSCs and ESCs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 47 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
