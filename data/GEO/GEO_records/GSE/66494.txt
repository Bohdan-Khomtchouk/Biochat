TITLE
Development of gene expression profiles in human chronic kidney disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis with renal biopsy specimens from CKD patients was conducted in order to identify the responsible genes associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular cell injury in CKD. This study showed microarray profiles in total 53 biopsy specimens of CKD patients. In the discovery set, 554 down-regulated and 226 up-regulated signatures were identified. Then, the expressional changes of these genes were examined in the validation set.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles in human chronic kidney disease was explored using renal biopsy specimens. Two independent studies: discovery set and validation set were performed.
