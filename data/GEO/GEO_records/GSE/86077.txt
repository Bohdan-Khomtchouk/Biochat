TITLE
LIN-28 balances longevity and germline stem cell number in C. elegans through let-7/AKT/DAF-16 axis

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic effects of lin-28 RNAi on N2 and glp-1 worms were compared.

DESIGN
RNA samples of N2 and glp-1 worms on adult day 4 under empty vector (EV) or lin-28 RNAi from L1 were sequenced.
