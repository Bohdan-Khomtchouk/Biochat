TITLE
Genome-Wide Promoter Analysis of Epigenetic Regulation by Cocaine (MM8 data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression contribute to the long-lasting regulation of the brain's reward circuitry seen in drug addiction, however, the specific genes regulated and the transcriptional mechanisms underlying such regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter microarray analysis to characterize genome-wide epigenetic changes in the mouse nucleus accumbens, a crucial brain reward region, after repeated cocaine administration. Our findings reveal several interesting principles of gene regulation by cocaine and of the role of ΔFosB and CREB, two prominent cocaine-induced transcription factors, in this brain region.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with cocaine or saline. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed for methylated histone H3 lysine 9 and 27, ∆FosB, and phospho-CREB as described previously (Kumar et al., 2005) with minor modifications. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified via ligation-mediated PCR and hybridized to Nimblgen mouse MM8 promoter arrays.  2-3 biological replicates per condition.
