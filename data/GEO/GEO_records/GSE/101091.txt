TITLE
LCM-seq of resident NG2 glia reprogrammed to neurons in vivo using the transcription factors Ascl1, Lmx1a and Nurr1 (ALN)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming resident glia into functional and subtype-specific neurons in vivo by delivering reprogramming genes directly to the brain provides a step forward towards the possibility of treating brain injuries or diseases. Here, we show that neurons reprogrammed using Ascl1, Lmx1a and Nurr1 functionally mature and integrate into existing brain circuitry, and that the majority of the reprogrammed neurons have properties of fast spiking, parvalbumin-containing interneurons.

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples were analyzed. Each sample is consists of approximately  33 laser-captured reprogrammed-neurons identified by nuclear GFP and expressing the transcription factors Ascl1, Lmx1a and Nurr1 (ALN).

PLATFORM
