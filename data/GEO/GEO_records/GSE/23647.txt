TITLE
cDNA microarray assay of lymph node biopsies diagnosed as lymphoma or as reactive tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of biopsied human lymph node (LN) tissue comparing each patient sample against mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), the reference channel Evaluate whether gene expression microarray can diagnose lymph node biopsies as reactive or as one of three main types of lymphoma: classical Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma (cHL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL).

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, LN vs mobilised PBSC, 116 cases assayed, 1 replicate per array
