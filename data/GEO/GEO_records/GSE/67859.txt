TITLE
Detection of chromatin accessibility in WT and SRC-2-/- mice in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We futher characterized genome-wide chromatin accessibility of WT and SRC-2-/- mouse liver at CT10 through DNase-Seq.  In addition,chromatin accessibility was significantly reduced in SRC-2-/- mouse liver compared to WT mice at CT10.

DESIGN
DNase-Seq was carried out in WT and SRC-2-/- mice in liver at CT10 using two doses of DNaseI.
