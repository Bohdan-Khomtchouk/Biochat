TITLE
Enforcement of developmental lineage specificity by transcription factor Oct1 (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) co-express Oct4/POU5F1 and an Oct4 paralog known Oct1/POU2F1. To study the role of Oct1 in embryonic stem cell transcriptional control and pluripotency, we constructed germline and inducible-conditional Oct1 deficient ESC lines. ESCs lacking Oct1 show normal appearance, self-renewal, growth rates and metabolic signatures. However loss of Oct1 results in defective lineage specification. ESCs lacking Oct1 fail to form beating cardiomyocytes in culture, generate neurons poorly, form smaller, less differentiated teratomas, and are incapable of generating chimeric mice. Upon RA-mediated neuronal differentiation, Oct1 deficient cells fail to properly induce developmentally poised genes. Simultaneously, genes for alternative developmental pathways, most notably for the development of extra-embryonic tissues, are inappropriately expressed. ChIP experiments show that Oct1 does not occupy pluripotency genes or differentially expressed developmental targets in ESCs. Additionally, Oct1 occupies developmental targets as cells differentiate and Oct4 is lost. These results are consistent with a role for Oct1 in promoting the expression of lineage-specific genes in differentiating cells while simultaneously repressing genes specific for alternative lineages.

DESIGN
Two genotypes (WT and an Oct1 inducible knockout) in mouse embryonic stem cells were compared at two different stages of differentiation (day 0 and day 14). Experiment performed in triplicate, with 12 samples total.
