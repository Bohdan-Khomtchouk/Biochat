TITLE
Regulation of Mouse Lens Development and Gene Expression by Kr√ºppel-Like Factor 4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional disruption of Klf4 in the ectoderm-derived tissues of the eye results in defective cornea, conjunctiva and the lens. Expression of Klf4 is first detected in the embryonic day-12 (E12) mouse lens, peaks at E16, and declines thereafter. Lenses from Mice which were conditional null for Klf4 (Klf4CN) were characterized by morphology and transcriptome.

DESIGN
Wild type and Klf4-conditional null mouse lens gene expression at  embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) and postnatal day 56 (PN56) was surveyed using Affymetrix mouse whole genome 430 2 arrays.
