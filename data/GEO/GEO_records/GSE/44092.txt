TITLE
Bisulfite-Seq profiling of undifferentiated ESCs, and in vitro derived primordial germ cells (iPGCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that in vitro derived PGCs undergo genome-wide DNA demethylation and that this demethylation does not require Tet1/Tet2

DESIGN
Examination of methylation in ESCs, iPGCs, and Tet2-/- iPGCs depleted of Tet1 by shRNA lentiviruses

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
