TITLE
Identification and analysis of transgene-derived endo-siRNAs in Drosophila Schneider cells by Solexa sequencing.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Colonization of genomes by a new selfish genetic element is detrimental to the host species and must lead to an efficient, repressive response. In vertebrates as well as in Drosophila, piRNAs repress transposons in the germ line while endogenous siRNAs take on this role in somatic cells. For endo-siRNAs as well as for piRNAs, it is unclear how an efficient response can be initiated de novo. Our experiments establish that the endo-siRNA pathway will target artificially introduced sequences without the need for a pre-existing template in the genome. This response is also triggered in transiently transfected cells, thus genomic integration is not essential. Deep sequencing revealed that corresponding endo-siRNAs are generated throughout the sequence, but preferentially from transcribed regions.
