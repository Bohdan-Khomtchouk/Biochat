TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of Yersinia pestis Ysp AHL quorum sensing at 37°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Quorum sensing is a cell to cell communication process that involves chemical signaling. Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, has two functional AHL quorum sensing systems Ysp and Ype. For several reasons, it was not clear what effect AHL pathways have on virulence gene expression and survival in the two different hosts, flea and human. To investigate to what effect Ysp AHL quorum sensing has on gene expression, we conducted microarray studies comparing Yersinia pestis CO92 (∆pgm) to a single AHL mutant strain (∆pgm ΔyspI) at 37°C.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from Y. pestis CO92 Δpgm ΔyspI cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from control Y. pestis CO92 R88 cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. For three arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 555 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Alexa 647 dye; the dyes were reversed for the other three arrays to account for any dye bias.

PLATFORM
GPL9009 JCVI PFGRC Yersinia pestis 18K v5 array designed primarily based on strain CO92
