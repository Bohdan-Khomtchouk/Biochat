TITLE
Gene expression profile of rice shoot in response to macronutrient deficiency

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Macronutrients are pivotal elements for proper plant growth and development. We performed microarray analysis of rice shoot under nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) deficiency conditions to obtain a global view of gene regulations associated with plant response to essential nutrients.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis of rice shoot under N, P and K deficiency conditions (1/4, 1/16 and 1/64 of normal concentration) and control for each nutrient. We collected a total of 36 microarray data corresponding to 12 samples with 3 replicates.
