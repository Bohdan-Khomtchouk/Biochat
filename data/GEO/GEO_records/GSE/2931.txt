TITLE
5'DFUR treatment in MCF7. Effect at 24 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 cells were treated during 90 minuts with 5'DFUR 250uM in presence or absence of NBTI 100nM. RNA from two independent experiments was isolated and hybridization was performed in duplicate in all cases, using reciprocal labelling Keywords: 5'DFUR effect. Time 24h

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated during 90 min with 5â€™-DFUR 250 mM either in the presence or the absence of NBTI 100 nM. After 24 hours cells were trypsinized and total RNA was isolated and amplified. To ensure the reproducibility of the technique cDNA hybridization was performed in duplicate in all cases, using reciprocal labelling. Moreover,  RNA from two independent experiments was isolated, thus, four microarray were hybridized for each condition.
