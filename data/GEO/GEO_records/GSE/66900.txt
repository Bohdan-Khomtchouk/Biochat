TITLE
Evolutionary comparison reveals that diverging CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites are signatures of ancestral topological associating domains borders

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ; Danio rerio ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of conserved TAD boundaries reveals that diverging CTCF sites is an evolutionary conserved signature associated with TAD borders

DESIGN
4C-seq samples for six gene family  promoters in different samples:  E9.5  and E14.5 mouse embryos ; 24hpf, 48hpf, 80%epiboly and Dome zebrafish embryos ; 48hpf S.purpuratus embryos
