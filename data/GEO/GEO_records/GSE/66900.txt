TITLE
Evolutionary comparison reveals that diverging CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites are signatures of ancestral topological associating domains borders

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Comparison of conserved TAD boundaries reveals that diverging CTCF sites is an evolutionary conserved signature associated with TAD borders

DESIGN
4C-seq samples for six gene family  promoters in different samples:  E9.5  and E14.5 mouse embryos ; 24hpf, 48hpf, 80%epiboly and Dome zebrafish embryos ; 48hpf S.purpuratus embryos
