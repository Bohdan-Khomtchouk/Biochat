TITLE
Genomic predictors of response to doxorubicin versus docetaxel in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Low topo2a expression and ER-negative status were predictors of response to doxorubicin, while small tumor size and ER-negative status predicted response to docetaxel.  Docetaxel was superior to doxorubicin in triple-negative/basal-like tumors, while no significant differences between these drugs were seen in the remaining intrinsic subtypes Keywords: reference x sample
