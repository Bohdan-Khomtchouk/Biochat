TITLE
RNA-sequencing of Scr or miR-99 KD L-GMPs from MLL-F9 AML secondary recipients

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We FACS purified L-GMP cells (GFP+ tdTom+ c-Kit+ Sca-1+ CD16/32+ CD34+)  from mice transplanted with post-transformed Scr or miR-99 KD MLL-AF9 bone marrow and performed RNA-sequencing, demonstrating miR-99 KD results in induction differentiation and enrichment for a normal GMP gene expression signature

DESIGN
FACS purification of Scr and miR-99 KD L-GMPs from 2 mice in each group

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
