TITLE
Gene expression data of Kas-/- mouse emobryonic fibroblasts transfected with KRAS siRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Kras/Hras/Nras-triple knockout MEFs expressing recombinant Nras to test the off-target effect of 2 Kras siRNAs at different transfection concentrations. Gene expression profiles were generated using Affimymetrix Mouse Gene ST 2.0 microarrays.

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with Kras siRNAs and gene expression profiles were generated to identify genes up or down regulated by each siRNA at different transfection concentrations.

PLATFORM
