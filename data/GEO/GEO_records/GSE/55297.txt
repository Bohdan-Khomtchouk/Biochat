TITLE
Microarray analysis of leaf rust-induced bread wheat genes

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
One week old bread wheat plantlets were artifically infected with Puccinia triticinae (the causal organism of wheat leaf rust) and samples were collected after one week from infection. Samples were collected after one week from infection, non infected as well. Two loacl varities were used MISR 1 and GEMMZA 7.

DESIGN
Four chamber slide was used and single dye (Cy3) was detedcted. Non infected samples from both varities were hybridized in two chamber seperately and the other two chamber were assigned for the two infected samples.

PLATFORM
