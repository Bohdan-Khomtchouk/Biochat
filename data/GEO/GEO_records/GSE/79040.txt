TITLE
RIPK3 restricts myeloid leukemogenesis by promoting cell death and differentiation of leukemia initiating cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of gene expression patterns in lineage negative FLT3-ITD– and pMIG-transduced BM cells via microarray study. We performed a global mRNA profiling analysis of murine Lin– FLT3-ITD+ cells compared to empty-vector controls, purified 48h after transduction. We examined association patterns of FLT3-ITD and pMIG cells and identified a specific gene expression signature associated with FLT3-ITD signalling.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated lineage negative BM cells subjected to 48h of FLT3-ITD signalling compared to empty vector control.
