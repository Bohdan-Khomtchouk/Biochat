TITLE
Human colon epithelial cells treated with Clostridium difficile Toxins A and B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Toxin A and B from Clostridium difficile are the primary virulence factors in Clostridium difficile disease. The changes in gene transcription of human colon epithelial cells were investigated in vitro in order to better understand the many effects of both toxins.

DESIGN
HCT-8 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of either Toxin A or B (TcdA or TcdB). RNA was isolated 2, 6, and 24 hours after addition of toxin from untreated and toxin-treated cells.
