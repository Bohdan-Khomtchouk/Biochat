Gene expression analysis of TGF-beta signaling-disrupting gastric cancer cell line 2MLN

SUMMARY
Diffuse-type gastric carcinoma is a poor-prognostic cancer with high expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and thick stromal fibrosis. However, detailed investigations on the roles of TGF-β signaling in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma have not been performed. We generated two diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cell lines, dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor expressing cells (2MLN-dnTβRII) and GFP-expressing cells (2MLN-GFP). Cells were subcutaneously or orthotopically injected into nude mice. Although dnTβRII did not affect the growth of OCUM-2MLN in vitro, it accelerated the growth of subcutaneously or orthotopically transplanted tumors in vivo. By microarray analysis, we found gene expression of TSP-1, an angiogenic inhibitor, was down-regulated in dnTβRII tumors. This results suggested disruption of TGF-β signaling in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cells leads to alteration of tumor microenvironment and acceleration of tumor growth.
