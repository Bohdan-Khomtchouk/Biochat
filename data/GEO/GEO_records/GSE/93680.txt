TITLE
Identification of genes and pathways that regulated by PHF20 via gene expression profile analysis in U87 cell with PHF20 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common tumor of the central nervous system with poor prognosis. PHF20 was highly expressed in primary human glioma specimens. However, the molecular mechanism of by which PHF20 regulated glioblastoma remains poorly understood. In the study, we investigate the gene expression profile of that regulated by PHF20 in U87 cells.

DESIGN
The U87 cell lines were infected with shPHF20 while shCON was used as control. And the assays were performed in triplicate. Total RNA in the samples was isolated for double-strand cDNA synthesis, IVT and aRNA fragmentation. Then, it was processed for hybridization with The PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix). The raw data were normalized, and then differentially expressed genes were screened. Finally, gene ontology analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and network analysis were performed to find the hub genes and pathways that regulated by PHF20.
