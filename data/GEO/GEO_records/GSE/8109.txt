TITLE
S. coelicolor YSK3225 R5- Medium Time-course Study (Culture #2)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species is controlled by a complex genetic and biochemical network of global and pathway specific regulators.  Details of their precise interactions in mediating temporal and spatial expression of secondary metabolite genes remain poorly defined.  In this study, we employed whole-genome microarray methods to investigate the temporal transcriptome profiles of S. coelicolor A3(2) âˆ†absA1::apr mutant strain and compared with the M145 Wild-type strain (series submitted separately). Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Time-course study involved analysis of 6 samples (18h, 24h, 26h, 28h, 32h and 42h). All arrays used cDNA labeled with Alexa647 and gDNA labeled with Cy3.
