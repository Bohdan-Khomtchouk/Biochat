TITLE
Expression data from rice roots treated with Gln

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We used GeneChip Rice Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to identify genes that were rapidly induced by glutamine in rice roots. Transcriptomic analysis of rice roots revealed that the expression of at least 35 genes involved in metabolism, transport, signal transduction, and stress responses was rapidly induced by glutamine within 30 minutes.

DESIGN
Total RNA from â€“N and Gln-treated roots (2.5 mM Gln, 30 min) was extracted using a phenol extraction protocol. RNA samples from two biological repeats were sent to the Affymetrix Gene Expression Service Lab at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan ( http://ipmb.sinica.edu.tw/affy/ ) for target preparation, and hybridization to the GeneChip Rice Genome Array.
