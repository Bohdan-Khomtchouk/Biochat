TITLE
Longitudinal transcriptional pediatric SLE study with clinical parameters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify transcriptional correlates of SLE disease activity both at the cohort and at the individual levels. To do so, we longitudinally profiled the whole blood transcriptomes of 158 SLE patients by microarray for up to 4 years, yielding 924 SLE samples and 48 matched pediatric healthy samples. The transcriptional data are complemented by demographic, laboratory and clinical data.

DESIGN
996 samples analyzed of which 72 are Healthy controls and 924 are SLE; 24 technical replicates of healthy samples are included and were used for batch correction purposes.
