TITLE
Lactate Stress in L. plantarum WCFS1

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Cultures were grown untill an optical density of 1.0. Cells were subsequently stressed with 2000 mM Na-lactate and samples were taken in time (15, 30, and 60 minutes).

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized against a reference sample taken at t=0, just before addition of lactate. Biological duplicate was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL4318 WCFS Lactobacillus plantarum 11K 60-mer array, Version 1, our ID LPAG1
