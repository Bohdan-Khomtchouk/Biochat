TITLE
Transcriptome  of Staphylococcus aureus Response to Spermine

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus Mu50

SUMMARY
To explore the Spermine(Spm)-based antibacterial targets in S. aureus, time course-dependent transcriptome analysis was conducted on Mu50 (MRSA) in the absence and presence of Spm.

DESIGN
We conducted five independent microarray experiments in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Spm. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal of untreated (control) and Spm-treated (experimental) cultures for 15, 30 and 60 min exposures.
