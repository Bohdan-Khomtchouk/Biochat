TITLE
INS-1 cell lines (FLP-In T-REx)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Four rat insulinoma cell lines (INS-1) were generated that contain a FRT site for FLP recombinase mediated site specific integration of specific genes. In addition, the cell lines contain the tetracycline repressor allowing tetracycline (tet) induction of the introduced gene. By comparing the gene expression profiles of uninduced and tet-induced cells, target genes of introduced transcription factors or other signal tranduction molecules can be identified. The expression profiles of the parental INS-1 cell line and the four derivatives were determined on a RAE230A array, showing that the highly differentiated phenotype of the parental cell line was maintained in the clones.
