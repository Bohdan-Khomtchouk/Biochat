TITLE
Effect of hypoxia on gene expression by human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ischemia exists in many diseased tissues including arthritic joints, atherosclerotic plaques and malignant tumors. Macrophages accumulate in these sites and upregulate genes  in response to the hypoxia present. We used Illumina beadarrays  to investigate the effect of hypoxia (18h at 0.1% oxygen) on gene expression by human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro.

DESIGN
Primary macrophages were differentiated for 7 days in vitro from human peripheral blood (monocyte-derived macrophages, MDMs) and were subjected to severe hypoxia ( < 0.1% O2) or normoxia (20.9% O2) in 5% CO2 humidified multi-gas incubators. Two replicates per condition. The supplementary file 'GSE16099_non-normalized_data.txt' contains non-normalized (raw) data for Samples GSM402885-GSM402888.
