TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of shoots and roots in japonica and indica rice seedlings under cold stress and recovery stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group ; Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice seedlings at 3-leaf stage were used for expression analysis in control and cold stressed (incloudling cold treatment for 3, 24hrs and recovery from cold stress for 24hrs) samples. Samples of shoots and roots from biological replicates of both genotypes were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Phalanx Rice OneArray＠ v1.

DESIGN
Control and treated biological replicates of cold-tolerant cultivar TNG67 (japonica) and cold-sensitive cultivar TCN1 (indica) were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL13702 Phalanx Rice OneArray® v1
