TITLE
4TO7 cells: miR-23b/27b/24 overexpression vs control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 4TO7 cells featuring ectopic expression of miR-23b/27b/24 compared to vector control cells. Gene expression changes will be examined as potential direct targets of the miRNAs for use in later studies on metastasis suppression or activation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, miRNA overexpressing cells vs vector control. Biological replicates: 2 transfection replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
