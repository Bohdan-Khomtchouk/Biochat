TITLE
ChIP-chip of brm in Drosophila embryos at pupae time point.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling 2.0R arrays for multiple transcription factor antibodies at various time-points of Drosophila development. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Affymetrix Drosophila Tiling 2.0R arrays. At least 3 biological replicates for the ChIP sample have been hybridized.
