TITLE
Expression profiling basal and luminal prostate epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immuno-stained (keratin 14+ basal marker) frozen prostate sections were subjected to laser-guided microdissection to isolate basal and luminal epithelial prostate cells for expression profiling. RNA was amplified using the AmpTec TRinucleotide kit (AmpTec GmBH). Expression profiling performed using the Invitrogen post-labelling kit and the CRUK whole genome array (WGA) gene set. Keywords: repeat sample

DESIGN
10 samples  - All samples compared to universal reference RNA

PLATFORM
