TITLE
Expression data from E. coli O157:H7 growth in the absence or presence of HEp-2 epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
E. coli O157:H7 global gene expression profile is altered during growth in the presence of Hep-2 cells, relative to the absence of cells We used Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 genechips to determine gene expression changes

DESIGN
E. coli O157:H7 total RNA extracts were collected after a 6 hour regrowth period in either the presence or absence of Hep-2 cells.  E. coli O157:H7 total RNA extracts were collected after a 6 hour regrowth period in minimal media with 5% CO2.
