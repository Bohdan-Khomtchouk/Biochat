TITLE
Human gingival fibroblasts: control vs. lysophosphatidic acid (LPA 18:1)-treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of pass 2 primary human gingival fibroblasts (GF) comparing control untreated GF with GF treated with LPA 18:1 for 2h or 8h. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of LPA 18:1 on global GF gene expression.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, GF vs. LPA-treated (2h, 8h) GF cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 LPA-treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
