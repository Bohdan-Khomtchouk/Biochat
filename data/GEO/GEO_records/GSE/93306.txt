TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression analyses revealed dysregulation of genes important for sympathetic neuron development in isl1 cko and hypomorphic mutant embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding factors that drive development and function of the sympathetic neuron  is crucial to development of potential therapies for neuroblastoma. Here, we identify a key cell autonomous role for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 for survival, proliferation and differentiation of sympathetic neurons throughout development. Analysis of several Isl1 mutant mouse lines, including one in which Isl1 was specifically ablated in sympathetic neuron (Wnt1-cre;Isl1 f/f) revealed an early requirement for Isl1 within sympathetic neurons for  proliferation and surrvial. RNA-seq analyses on sympathetic neurons revealed dysregulation of a number of genes critical for sympathetic neuron development .Our studies demonstrated that ISL1 regulated the peoliferation, surrvial and differentiation.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of sympathetic ganglion dissected from E11.5 or E14.5 wild-type and isl1 mutant embryos.

PLATFORM
