TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in high-risk neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we evaluated the miRNA expression profile of 31 high risk, stage 4 neuroblastoma patients.

DESIGN
We compared miRNA expression profiles of 14 long-survivors (alive with an overall survival time > 36 months) and 17 short-survivors (dead of disease within 36 months from diagnosis. Deaths due to toxicity were censored).
