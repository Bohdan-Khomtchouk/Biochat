TITLE
Somatic mutations in p85α promote tumorigenesis through p110α activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frequent mutations in the regulatory p85a subunit (PIK3R1 gene) were identified in colon cancer and shown to promote cell survival, Akt activation, anchorage independent cell growth and oncogenesis. A number of tumor samples including colon, breast, NSCLC and gastric were also profiled for co-occurrence of chromosomal copy number changes including gene amplifications in PI3K pathway on Affymterix 100K SNP arrays.

DESIGN
Analysis of copy number changes in several different tumor types
