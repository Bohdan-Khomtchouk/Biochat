TITLE
Salmonella enteritidis ciprofloxacin resistance effect on transcription in LB

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis

SUMMARY
comparison of total RNA profiles obtained from ciprofloxacin resistant colonies of two separate Enteritidis isolates with their respective wt parents

DESIGN
total RNA of both wt (with reduced cip sensitivity at MIC=0.2 ug/ml) and spontaneous cipR mutants (MIC > 32ug/ml) in LB log phase was harvested from Enteritidis strain 104 (from poultry host) and Enteritidis 5408 (from human host), and compared on a PCR product array
