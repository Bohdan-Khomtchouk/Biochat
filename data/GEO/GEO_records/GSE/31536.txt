TITLE
Changes in miRNA expression in mouse primary visual cortex following visual deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Visual deprivation, either in the form of dark rearing (DR) or monocular deprivation (MD) are established paradigms for studying cortical plasticity. We have used miRNA microarray to uncover miRNAs whose expression  is altered  in primary visual cortex following DR and/or MD.
