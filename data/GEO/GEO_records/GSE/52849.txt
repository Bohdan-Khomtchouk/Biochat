TITLE
Cell cycle transition from S-phase to G1 in Caulobacter is mediated by ancestral virulence regulators

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium fredii ; Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
We report that ancestral zinc-finger-domain transcriptional regulators, previously  reported to control virulence/symbiosis, implement a cell cycle (S→G1) transcriptional  switch. To unravel how this G1-phase transcriptional program is reinstated during a  primitive cell cycle, we first defined G1-specific promoters in the model bacterium  Caulobacter crescentus by comparative ChIP-Seq analysis. We then exploited one  such promoter as genetic proxy, to identify two conserved developmental regulator  paralogs, MucR1/2, that constitute a quadripartite and homeostatic regulatory module  directing the switch from S→G1-phase transcription. Surprisingly, MucR orthologs that  regulate virulence and symbiosis gene transcription in Brucella, Agrobacterium or  Sinorhizobium support the G1 transcriptional switch in Caulobacter. Pan-genomic  ChIP-Seq analyses in Sinorhizobium and Caulobacter show that this module targets  orthologous genes. Thus, this ancestral bacterial lineage from which eukaryotic  organelles descended may coordinate virulence/symbiosis with other cell cycle  functions using a primordial transcription factor fold that is now primarily found in the  eukaryotic domain of life.
