SUMMARY
In this study 405 patients with unexplained mental retardation and 89 unaffected parents were analyzed for DNA copy-number changes using a tiling-resolution genomewide microarray containing 32,447 BACs. This series contains 367 slides from 315 individuals previously not reported, plus an additional 239 slides from 179 individuals previously reported in the series GSE3191. Keywords: array CGH
