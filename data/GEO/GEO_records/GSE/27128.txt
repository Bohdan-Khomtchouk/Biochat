TITLE
Expression levels in strained vs. non-strained Calu-3 lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ventilator induced lung injury can lead to serious conditions like ARDS which are associated with a high mortality (around 30%, Stapleton et al., Chest, 2005). We hypothesized that changes of expression levels of different genes would lead us to the identification of critical target genes, which might influence the inflammation and outcome associated with this condition. We used human whole genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays to detail the changes of gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Confluent non strained and strained human Calu-3 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The experiment was performed with 3 replicates.
