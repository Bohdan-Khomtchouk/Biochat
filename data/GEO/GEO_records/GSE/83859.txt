TITLE
Whole organism transcriptomic analysis provides mechanistic insight into the acute toxicity of emamectin benzoate in Daphnia magna

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
This experiment was conducted to study the short-term (12h) transcriptional responses in Daphnia magna after exposure to the anti-sea lice chemical emamectin benzoate (EMB). The microarray results were further vefiried using qPCR. The gene exression responses were linked to adverse effects after 48h exposure, in order to supply knowledge for environmental hazard assessment of this chemical in non-target crustaceans.

DESIGN
Neonatal ( < 24h) Daphnia magna were exposed to 7.8-2000 pM waterborne emamectin benzoate for 12h. Microarray analysis was performed using pooled whole-organism D. magna (8 individuals) and 4 biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment group.

PLATFORM
GPL22095 NIVA DM 60k microarray V1
