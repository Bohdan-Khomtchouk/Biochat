TITLE
Gene expression data from retina of Babl/c mouse under white LED light exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The widely used white light-emitting diodes (LED) deliver higher levels of blue light than do conventional domestic light sources. The high intensity of blue component is the main source of concern about the health risks of LED with respect to their light-toxicity to the retina. White LED light with higher correlated color temperature (CCT) is more likely to cause retinal injury in mice, significantly reducing the number of ONL nuclei, however apoptosis pathway may not be the only mechanism. We used the Affymetrix GeneChip (Mouse Genome 430 2.0) to describe the different influence on gene expression of mouse retina under white LED light with different CCT.

DESIGN
White LED light with CCT of 2954, 7378K were used for exposure experiments on 10-week-old Babl/c mice for 14 days (light cycle of 12 hours-on / 12 hours-off). Normal control mice were raised in a relatively dark environment. Retinal genome-wide expression patterns of control group, 2954K group and 7378K group were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip (Mouse Genome 430 2.0) to describe the overall difference of gene expression in mouse retina. For example, after LED light exposure, we harvested the mouse retina of right eye for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each three retinas of the same group are concentrated together and three sample were repeated. The sample ID is as follows: Control Group: NC1, NC2 and NC3; 2954 K Group: 3K1, 3K2 and 3K3; 7378 K Group : 7K1, 7K2 and 7K3.
