TITLE
Drosha knock-down gene expression in HSPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression differences are compared for a normal and mutant cell line.

DESIGN
The data compares the effect of a gene mutation on genome-wide expression. empty vector (EV), shDrosha (shDr); shDr denotes hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced with a short-hairpin RNA targeting the miRNA-processing enzyme Drosha
