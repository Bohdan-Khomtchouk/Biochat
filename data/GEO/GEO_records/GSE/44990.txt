TITLE
Expression changes in Tetrahymena thermophila TRX1 and EZL2 gene knockouts and after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
12 genome-wide microarrays to investigate the Tetrahymena thermophila gene expression changes in TRX1 and EZL2 gene knockout and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment conditions.

DESIGN
For the TRR1 knockout (KO) condition, wild type (WT427) cells and TRX1 KO cells were cultured using 1XSPP, 30 degrees, 100 rpm shaking, until 350,000 cells/ml. For the EZL21 knockout (KO) condition, wild type (WT427) cells and EZL2 KO cells were cultured using 1XSPP, 30 degrees, 100 rpm shaking, until 350,000 cells/ml. For the HU treatment condition, HU was used to treat the WT427 cells for 48 hours, setting wild type (WT427) as the control; cells were cultured using 1XSPP, 30 degrees, 100 rpm shaking. Each sample has two biological replicates.
