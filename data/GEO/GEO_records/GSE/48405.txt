TITLE
Human plasma: circulating microRNA after acute resistance exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling of circulating miRNAs before, 60 mins, 1day and 3 days after an acute resistance exercise.

DESIGN
Three subjects performed an acute resistance exercise. The resistance exercise consisted of two consecutive exercises (bench press and bilateral leg press), consisting of five sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of 1 RM. The subjects were allowed to rest for 1 min between each set and exercise. The subjects were instructed to lift and lower the load at a constant velocity, taking about 2 s for each repetition. If the load became too heavy, the subject was assisted. The range of motion in each exercise was from 90° to 0° (0° at full extension). Blood samples were taken before, 60 mins, 1day and 3days after the exercise.
