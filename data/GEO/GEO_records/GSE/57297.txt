TITLE
Identification of significant gene regulations for breast cancer from human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To discover individual genes with potential diagnostic and therapeutic utilities, we use gene expression profiling from real patient tissues to identify significantly regulated genes out of a broad coverage of human transcriptome. We use Agilent gene expression microarray technologies to measure gene expressions of 32 cancerous and normal tissues from breast cancer patients. Total RNAs were extracted and analyzed using Agilent microarray technologies. The whole genome expression profiling has been proformed and several significantly differently expressed genes (such as HS3ST4, MMP1, MMP11) were quatified by qPCR to verify their up/down-regulations, leading to discovery of important genes related to breast cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
We examined 32 human breast tissues of three different breast cancer subtypes (including Luminal A, Luminal B, Triple Negative) and normal controls to perform microarray gene expression profiling.
