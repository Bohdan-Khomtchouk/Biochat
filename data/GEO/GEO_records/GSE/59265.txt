TITLE
Genome wide DNA copy number analysis of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genome wide DNA copy number profiles of the biphasic epithelioid (E-) and sarcomatoid (S-) components of sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma were analyzed using SNP arrays.  The E- and S- components showed a similar DNA copy number profile, despite morphologic differences.

DESIGN
Total DNA obtained from 10 sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma samples (9 E- and S- pairs and 1 unpaired S) and 5 normal adjacent kidneys.
