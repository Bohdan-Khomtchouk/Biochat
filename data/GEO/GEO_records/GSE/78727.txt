TITLE
Genome-wide binding sites for Arabidopsis REPLUMLESS

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana REPLUMLESS gene (RPL), also known as PENNYWISE (PNY) and BELLRINGER (BLR) encodes a BEL1-like TALE homeodomain (BLH) transcription factor that controls multiple aspects of meristem and floral development, including meristem maintenance, phyllotaxis, transition to flowering, stem development and floral organ patterning [1-3]. As part of a screen for genes that mediate the function of RPL in the processes above, we performed ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide RPL binding sites within inflorescence apices.     1.

DESIGN
Plants expressing GFP-tagged RPL (pRPL:RPL-GFP) were used for ChIP-seq with anti-GFP antibodies; wild-type controls (Landsberg-erecta) were used as epitope-negatve controls.
