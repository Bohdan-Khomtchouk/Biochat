TITLE
Gene expression profiling of four subpopulations in GBM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GBM is a heterogenous brain tumor with hyperproliferation of endothelial cells. In order to understand the cellular mechanism of vasculogenesis in GBM, four fractions of cells are seperated. Microarray assays was performed to examine the potential lineage relationship and the signal pathways involved in determining the cell identity and function.

DESIGN
Four subpopulation of cells were seperated from two independent GBM dissociates by FCAS assay based on the expression of membrane marker CD133 and CD144. Total RNA was extracted from freshly sorted cells without any culture.
