TITLE
Expression data from brain tissue of Rattus norvegicus treated with D-Serine

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
d-serine is naturally present throughout the human body.  It is also used as add-on therapy for treatment-refractory schizophrenia. d-Serine interacts with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site of NMDA receptor, and this interaction could lead to potentially toxic activity (i.e., excitotoxicity) in brain tissue.  The transcriptomic changes that occur in the brain after d-serine exposure have not been fully explored. Affymetrix microarray technology was used to determine differential gene expression resulting from D-Serine exposure. Keywords: Dose course

DESIGN
Male Fisher 344 rats aged 11-12 weeks were treated with various doses (0, 5, 20, 50, 200 & 500 mg/kg) of d-serine and terminally sacrificed 96 hours post-exposure.  An approximate 30mg-section of the forebrain was processed for total RNA isolation.
