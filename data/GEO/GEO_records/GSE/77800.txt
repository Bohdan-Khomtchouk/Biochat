TITLE
CHO-S transcriptome in batch culture

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic data from CHO-S cells were gathered from multiple time points during batch culture to provide information about gene presence/absence for generation of a CHO-S cell line specific model using the GIMME algorithm.

DESIGN
CHO-S cells were grown in batch culture (n=4), samples were taken every 12 hours between t=72 and t=180h for sequencing.

PLATFORM
