TITLE
Molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 permissiveness in CCR4+CCR6+ Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously reported that CCR4+CCR6+Th17 cells are permissive to HIV, while CXCR3+CCR6- Th1 cells are relatively resistant. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying these differences, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional profiling in CXCR3+CCR6-Th1, CCR4+CCR6-Th2, CCR4+CCR6+Th17, and CXCR3+CCR6+Th1Th17 upon TCR triggering. Transcriptional differences between Th17 and Th1 were the most remarkable. HIV-DNA integration was highly efficient in Th17 versus Th1 upon exposure to both wild-type and VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV, indicative that post-entry mechanisms contribute to HIV permissiveness.

DESIGN
4 cell populations from up to 5 donors for a total of 19 samples.
