TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of undifferentiated H1 hESC, and hEB cells differentiated with SF BVF2H conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of human embryoid body (hEB) differentiations during differentiation in serum free conditions in the presence of BMP4, VEGF, and FGF2 growth factors A total of 5 samples are analyzed. Each sample is taken at each time point. There is no replicate. H1_hESC_day0 sample is used as control to compare to other samples Keywords: Cell differentiation

DESIGN
Cell differentiation compares to undifferentiated status in a time-course of 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-day without replicates.
