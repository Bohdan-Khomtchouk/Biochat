TITLE
PLK1 signaling coopereates with estrogen receptor-dependent gene transcription.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with estadiol for 6 h in presence or absence of the specific PLK1 inhibitor BI2536. Together with CHIP and global phosphoproteome data, the results demonstrate a key role of PLK1 in the estrogen receptor-mediated gene response.

DESIGN
Hormone-deprived MCF7 cells were pretreated with BI2536 or vehicle (DMSO) followed by induction with estradiol (E2) or vehicle (ethanol). RNA of each condition was analysed in triplicate on an Agilent Human genome 4x44k v2 microarray [note: MCF7_DMSO_E2_rep3 sample was a clear technical outlier (poor hybridization), and was therefore excluded from the further analysis/this record].
