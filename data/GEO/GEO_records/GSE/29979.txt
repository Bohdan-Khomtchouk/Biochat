TITLE
Radiation-Induced Genomic Instability in Caenorhabditis Elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Significant impacts on gene expression were observed generations after exposure in ionising radiation exposed nematodes.

DESIGN
C. elegans were exposed to 1 Gy of X-rays and their gene expression was analysed several generations later with whole genome oligoarrays (Washington University).
