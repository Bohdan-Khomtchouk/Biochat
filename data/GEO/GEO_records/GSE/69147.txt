TITLE
Histone genes transcription regulators binding in human cancer (U2OS) and normal (hTERT-RPE1) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regulation of replication-dependent histone genes by CASP8AP2 and NPAT is likely direct, based on ChIP-seq. CASP8AP2 and NPAT ChIP-Seq peaks were enriched near transcription start sites (TSSs) of replication-dependent, but not replication-independent histone genes on chromosomes 1, 6 and 12 in both cell lines. HINFP ChIP-Seq peaks were enriched near transcription start sites (TSSs) of replication-dependent histone genes H4 and H2B and replication-independent histone genes H1FX and H1F0 in both cell lines. Another histone gene regulator, E2F1 also bound to TSSs of many histone genes mainly replication-independent.
