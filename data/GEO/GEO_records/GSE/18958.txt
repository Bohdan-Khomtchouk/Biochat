TITLE
Endogenous short RNAs in Mucor circinelloides sequenced on the Illumina platform (Solexa)

ORGANISM
Mucor circinelloides

SUMMARY
We sequenced Endogenous short RNAs in Mucor circinelloides fungus grown in standard liquid culture. Short RNAs were profiled in wild type, Dicer-like 1 mutant (dcl1-), Dicer-like 2 mutant (dcl2-) and double Dicer mutant (dcl1-/dcl2-) strains. We identified many loci that produced less short RNAs in the dcl2- strain suggesting that DCL2 is the major protein generating short RNAs in Mucor circinelloides.

DESIGN
Endogenous short RNAs were profiled in wild type, single and double dcl mutant strains.
