TITLE
Effects of extensive fasting on hepatic transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporally restricted feeding has a profound effect on the hepatic circadian clock. While the circadian clock is largely unaffected by by extensive fasting, many transcripts are known to be affected by a fasting paradigm. This dataset shows the effect of extensive fasting on dynamic gene expression in the liver

DESIGN
C57/B6 mice were entrained to ad libitum feeding schedule for two weeks. They were then released into constant were food was withdrawn at CT16. On the second day in constant darkness tissue was collected at the indicated timepoints. Total RNA was extracted and 5ug of total RNA was used for the standard Affymetrix protocol of amplification, labeling and hybridization
