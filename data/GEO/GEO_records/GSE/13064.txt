TITLE
Effects of extensive fasting on hepatic transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporally restricted feeding has a profound effect on the hepatic circadian clock. While the circadian clock is largely unaffected by by extensive fasting, many transcripts are known to be affected by a fasting paradigm. This dataset shows the effect of extensive fasting on dynamic gene expression in the liver
