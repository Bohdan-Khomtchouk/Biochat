TITLE
Effect of L1CAM Knockout on Gene Expression in the Cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cerebellum from post-natal day 11 L1 knockout mice on the 129Sv background were compared to wild type littermates.  The original goal of the study was to determine if there was compensation from other L1 family members or alterations in cell survival or apoptosis.  Interestingly no major changes were detected in those families or pathways.

DESIGN
The microarray experiment was conducted by extracting total RNA from the cerebellums of three postnatal day 11 congenic 129Sv L1 knock outs and three of their wild type siblings utilizing Qiagen's RNeasy Mini kit (# 74104). Therefore, each genotype, L1KO and wildtype, had three replicates. Samples were processed at the Case Western Reserve University Cancer Center Gene Expression Array Core Facility and hybridized to Affymetrix Murine Genome U74AV2 gene chips.
