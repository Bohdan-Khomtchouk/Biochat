TITLE
Effect of L1CAM Knockout on Gene Expression in the Cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cerebellum from post-natal day 11 L1 knockout mice on the 129Sv background were compared to wild type littermates.  The original goal of the study was to determine if there was compensation from other L1 family members or alterations in cell survival or apoptosis.  Interestingly no major changes were detected in those families or pathways.
