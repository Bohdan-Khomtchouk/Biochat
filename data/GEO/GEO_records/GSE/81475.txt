TITLE
Zika Virus Disrupts Phospho-TBK1 Localization and Mitosis in Human Neural Stem Cell Model Systems

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Use single cell RNA-seq technology on neural epithelial stem cell culture to understand the composition and transcriptome property of the model system. The culture system was then used to study ZIKV infection. Methods: Single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis on NES cells in culture and single cells from  5-6 post conception week (pcw), 16 pcw, as well as 19-20 pcw human fetal neocortex. Results: We find that NES cells are highly similar to RGCs and neural progenitor cells in terms of their gene expression profile. Both NES cells and neural stem cells/progenitors from fetal neocortex expressed canonical marker genes of proliferating and differentiating neuronal cells. Conclusions: We successfully established the NCX-NES cell culture as an experimental system for the study of neural stem cells and used it to study ZIKV infection

DESIGN
Single cell RNA-seq of over 1,000 cells of NCX-NES cell culture and fetal brain.  All of the cells in this dataset are non-ZIKV-infected.
