TITLE
Expression data of hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent liver tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify therapeutic targets with high specificity to HCC, we searched for genes significantly up-regulated in HCC over corresponding non-tumor liver using high-density microarrays Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
HCC and surrounding non-tumor liver tissue samples were collected from 10 cases who underwent liver resection for HCC at National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). One Âµg of total RNA was converted to end-labeled cRNA using the Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The fluorescent cRNA probes were hybridized to Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix), as instructed by the supplier.
