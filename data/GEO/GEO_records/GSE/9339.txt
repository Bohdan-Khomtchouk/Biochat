TITLE
Analysis of the MSX1 downstream signaling network in neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system 	(SNS). One of the master regulator genes for peripheral SNS differentiation, the homeobox transcription factor PHOX2B, is mutated in familiar and sporadic neuroblastomas. Here we report that inducible expression of PHOX2B in the neuroblastoma cell line SJNB-8 down-regulates MSX1, a homeobox gene important for embryonic neural crest development. Inducible expression of MSX1 in SJNB-8 caused inhibition of both cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Affymetrix micro-		array and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that MSX1 strongly up-regulated the Delta-Notch pathway. These experiments describe for the first time regulation of the Delta-Notch pathway by MSX1, and connect these genes to the PHOX2B oncogene, indicative of a role in neuroblastoma biology. Keywords: Delta, Notch, MSX1, neuroblastoma, PHOX2B

DESIGN
Time course experiments of two independent clones (K2 and K5), with 2 or 4 	time points, respectively.
