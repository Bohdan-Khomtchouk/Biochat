TITLE
Expression changes induced by PTPN1 knockdown in KM-H2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression data for shRNA PTPN1 knockdown vs. Non-silencing in the classical Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell line KM-H2

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analyzed (2 Knockdown vs. 2 Non-silencing). The 2 knockdown and 2 non-silencing samples are technical replicates of each other.
