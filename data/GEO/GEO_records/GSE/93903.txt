TITLE
Impact of aging/caloric restriction on circadian gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis using the liver from young versus old mice, fed either normally or under caloric restriction reveals reorganization of distinct circadian signatures related to metabolic aging and nutrient-dependent counterbalance of aging by caloric restriction

DESIGN
Livers from young versus old mice fed either a normal diet or calorie-restricted diet were harvested over the circadian cycle at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 for gene expression analysis.
