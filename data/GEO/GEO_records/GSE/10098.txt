TITLE
Identification of downstream genes regulated by RFL

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To gain mechanistic insights on RFL functions in rice architecture, we have employed global expression profilling to identify the genes regulated by RFL. Transgenic rice panicle RNAs down-regulated for RFL were compared with the wild type panicle RNA of similar developmental stage. Genes downregulated in transgenic lines will be those which expression requires functional RFL whereas upregulated genes will need RFL for their repression. Keywords: Whole genome analysis for genes whose expression is regulated by RFL
