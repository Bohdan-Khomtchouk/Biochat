TITLE
Identification of downstream genes regulated by RFL

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To gain mechanistic insights on RFL functions in rice architecture, we have employed global expression profilling to identify the genes regulated by RFL. Transgenic rice panicle RNAs down-regulated for RFL were compared with the wild type panicle RNA of similar developmental stage. Genes downregulated in transgenic lines will be those which expression requires functional RFL whereas upregulated genes will need RFL for their repression. Keywords: Whole genome analysis for genes whose expression is regulated by RFL

DESIGN
Two independent biological RNA pools of dsRNAiRFL and RFL antisense transgenic panicles were compared with two independent wild type RNA pool in two different hybridizations. Two hybridizations were performed with reciprocally dye-labeled wild type RNA and respective mutant RNA.
