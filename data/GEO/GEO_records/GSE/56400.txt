TITLE
Effect of PARP1 inhibition on transcription in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the role of PARP1 in gene transcription in MCF7 cells under non-stress conditions. The hypothesis was that PARP1 activity in MCF7 cells plays a role in gene transcription. The results indicate that PARP1 inhibition does not significantly affect transcription after 6 hours of treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from MCF7 cells that had been treated with ABT-888, PJ34, Olaparib, or DMSO for 6 hours.
