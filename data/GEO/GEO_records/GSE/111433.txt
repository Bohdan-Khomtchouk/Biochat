TITLE
EZH2 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells harboring wildtype or mutant EZH2.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the occupancy and catalysis of wildtype and allosteric activation-decifient mutants of EZH2 in E14 mESC by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Examination of EZH2 and H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin in E14 mESC with different EZH2 genotypes.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
