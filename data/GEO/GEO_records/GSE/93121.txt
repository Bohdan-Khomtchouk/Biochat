TITLE
rs11-07_opine2 - septante soil - Transcriptomic changes induced by opine production in Arabidopsis thaliana grown in natural soil

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs11-07_opine2 - septante soil - Transcriptomic changes induced by opine production in Arabidopsis thaliana grown in natural soil - Arabidopsis thalian Col- line was transformed in order to obtain transgenic lines that produce opine compound (octopine and mannopine). Transgenic lines producing respectively octopine and mannopine and the WT line were grown in greenhouse under long-day condition in pots containing half commercial compost and half soil of la MÃ©rantaise and watered with water. Whole plant aged of one month were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The plants were ground with a mortar an pestls and RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy extraction kit (QIAGEN) with cristal of PVP. The RNA concentration was measured on a NANODrop spectrophotometer.
