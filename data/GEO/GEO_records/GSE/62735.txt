TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of transcription start sites in a ∆set2 strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we quantified the transcription start site usage in a WT strain (BY4741) and a ∆set2 strain associated with the appearence of cryptic transcription start sites.

DESIGN
Transcription start site usage was quantified using the 5’cap sequencing aproach for S. cerevisiae strains. Biological duplicates were included.
