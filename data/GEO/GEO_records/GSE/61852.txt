TITLE
YAP1 exerts its transcriptional control via TEAD-mediated activation of enhancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YAP1 is a major effector of the Hippo pathway and a well-established oncogene. Elevated YAP1 activity due to mutations in Hippo pathway components or YAP1 amplification is observed in several types of human cancers. Here we investigated its genomic binding landscape in YAP1-activated cancer cells, as well as in non-transformed cells. We demonstrate that TEAD transcription factors mediate YAP1 chromatin-binding genome-wide, further explaining their dominant role as primary mediators of YAP1-transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that YAP1 largely exerts its transcriptional control via distal enhancers that are marked by H3K27 acetylation and that YAP1 is necessary for this chromatin mark at bound enhancers and the activity of the associated genes. This work establishes YAP1-mediated transcriptional regulation at distal enhancers and provides an expanded set of target genes resulting in a fundamental source to study YAP1 function in a normal and cancer setting.

DESIGN
Sequencing of ChIP and input samples for YAP1 and TEAD1 transcription factors and H3K27ac histone modification in SF268 glioblastoma cells and for YAP1 transcription factor in NCI-H2052 mesothelioma cells and IMR90 non-transformed lung fibroblast cells.
