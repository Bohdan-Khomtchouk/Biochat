TITLE
oligosaccharide treatment - 24 hpt-Effect of oligosaccharide treatments on gene expression.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra10-03_eliciteur - oligosaccharide treatment - 24 hpt - Do the treatments modify gene expression in a way that can give us a hint as to their use in crop protection? What is the effect of the adjuvant on gene expression? - 6,5-week-old arabidopsis plants grown in short-day photoperiod were spray-treated with water, an adjuvant or oligosaccharides in the adjuvant (10 plants per condition, 4 replicates per condition). 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 48 hrs after the treatment, samples were taken (2 7mm diameter leaf disks per plant, from medium-aged leaves), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and later on total RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
16 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
