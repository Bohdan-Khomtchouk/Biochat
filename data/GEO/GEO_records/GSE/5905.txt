TITLE
E. coli TG1/pBS(Kan)Synhox and pBS(Kan) hydrogen production

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli TG1 with pBS(Kan)Synhox can produce more hydrogen than TG1/pBS(Kan).  To reveal the difference of metabolic activity (gene expression) between these strains in producing hydrogen, the differential gene expression analyses were performed.  All samples cultured in complex medium with fructose containg 5 mM IPTG. Keywords: hydrogen production

DESIGN
Strains: E. coli TG1/pBS(Kan)Synhox and TG1/pBS(Kan) Medium: Complex with fructose Hydrogen producing cells Time: 6 hour
