TITLE
Gene expression of attached and suspended Bim-/- Bmf-/- murine kidney epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suspension-induced cell death, or anoikis, is implicated in different stages of breast development as well as tumor progression and metastasis. The pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins BIM and BMF are known positive regulators of anoikis. We examined the gene expression changes that occur in BIM-/- BMF-/- cells during attachment and suspension.  This study is supplemental to our work establishing  a role for JNK in anoikis (Girnius N, Davis RJ. 2017. JNK promotes epithelial cell anoikis by transcriptional and post-translational regulation of BH3-only proteins. (2017) Cell Reports 21: 1910-1921; doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.067)

DESIGN
Bim-/- Bmf-/- murine kidney epithelial cells were cultured in attached or suspended conditions and gene expression was analyzed.  Three independent libraries were analyzed per condition.
