TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MeCP2 deficient zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in mecp2 morphant zebrafish embryos as compared to wild-type strain.

DESIGN
In order to explore the targets of transcription factor Mecp2 in zebrafish, we knockdown Mecp2 using morpholino targeting splice junction. Wild-type and mecp2 morphant embryos were collected and analyzed at 24hpf. Gene expression profiles of Mecp2 morphant embryos were compared to gene expression profiles of wild type embryos using Nimblegen whole transcriptome zebrafish microarrays.
