aCGH study of invasive duct carcinoma (IDC) of the breast without axillary lymph node LN and with sentinel LN metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
22 patients with IDC: 8 without LN metastases (IDC) and 14 with sentinel LN metastases (IDCM).  Sampling was limited to 29 paraffin blocks which could be used up without interference with diagnostic procedures: 8 IDCs, 11 IDCMs and 10 ipsilateral LN metastases [5 to the sentinel LN (first in lymph drainage chain, MS) and 5 to more distal (MD)].  7 IDCMs had samples of their LN metastases (IDCM9,13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19). 3 samples of metastases (MS20, 21, 22) did not have paired primary IDCM samples and 4 IDCMs (IDCM10, 11, 12, 16) did not have samples of their LN metastases. Keywords: Comparative clinical study
