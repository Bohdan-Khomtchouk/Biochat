TITLE
MOTS-c: A Novel Peptide Encoded by a Short Mitochondrial Open Reading Frame Regulates Metabolic Homeostasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mitochondria are known to be functional organelles, but their role as a signaling unit is increasingly being appreciated. The recent identification of a short open reading frame (sORF) in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes a signaling peptide, humanin, suggests the possible existence of additional sORFs in the mtDNA that yield bioactive peptides. Here we report the identification of a sORF within the mitochondrial 12S rRNA encoding a 16-amino-acid peptide named MOTS-c (mitochondrial open-reading-frame of the twelve S rRNA -c) that regulates insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis. MOTS-c is detected in various tissues and in circulation in an age-dependent manner. Its primary target organ appears to be the skeletal muscle and its cellular actions inhibit the folate cycle and its tethered de novo purine biosynthesis, causing a significant accumulation of AICAR levels concomitantly with AMPK activation. MOTS-c treatment in mice prevented age-dependent and high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, as well as diet-induced obesity. These results suggest that mitochondria may be more actively engaged in regulating metabolic homeostasis than previously recognized, through the production of peptides encoded within its genome that act at the cellular and organismal level.

DESIGN
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cell line) were cultured in 10-cm dishes in 7 mL of phenol-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated with water (controls) or the 16-amino-acid peptide mitochondrial open-reading-frame of the twelve S rRNA-c (MOTS-c, 10 uM) for 4 or 72 hours prior to RNA extraction.
