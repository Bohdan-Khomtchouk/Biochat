TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanism by which regulate skeletal development, we attempted to identify transcription factors that were highly expressed in developing cartilage during the embryonic stage.

DESIGN
Col2a1-Venus-Tg mice in which chondrocytes were fluorescently labelled with the GFP-modified Venus gene. We purified total RNA from Venus-negative and Venus-positive cells and performed microarray analysis using an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
