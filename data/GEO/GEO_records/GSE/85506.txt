TITLE
DNA methylation analysis in women with fibromyalgia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FM is a complex syndrome with physiological, genetics and environmental factors involved. It can present changes in functional neuroimaging, in cortical excitability measurements performed by transcranial magnetic stimulation and in grey matter density. Similarly, it has been shown that patients with FM have abnormal autonomic control, inflammatory profile and dysfunctional hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis leading to disruptive sleep and fatigue. We characterized clinical and neurophysiological parameters and peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of patients with FM and compared them to sex and age matched healthy controls. We hypothesized that these exploratory analyses could provide mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of FM and possibly contribute to the future development of biological markers of diagnosis.We showed that patients with fibromyalgia have different (mainly hypo-) methylated CpG sites related to genes implicated in immune system and response to external stress pathways and that this methylation profile is related to a dysfunctional connectivity in pain network, adding evidence to consider fibromyalgia as a DOHAD disorder.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 47 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infiniun 450k Human Methylation Beads following manufacture's protocols.
