TITLE
Biased gene expression in early honeybee larval development (sequencing)

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Female larvae of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) develop into either queens or workers depending on nutrition during larval development. This nutritional stimulus triggers different developmental trajectories, resulting in adults that differ in physiology, behaviour and life-span.  To understand how these developmental trajectories are established we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression throughout larval development.

DESIGN
Gene expression of honeybee queen and worker larval samples was analysed at 60 hours with high-throughout sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16097 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Apis mellifera)
