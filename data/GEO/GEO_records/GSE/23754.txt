TITLE
Acute ITP vs. Chronic ITP (Children)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood transcriptional profiling of pediatric idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients comparing self-limited acute ITP patients with chronic ITP patients or progression-to-chronic ITP patients.

DESIGN
Patient samples were collected during 3 different disease states: 8 samples from acute ITP pts (within 6 months of dx, during active disease), 4 samples from progression-to-chronic ITP pts (within 6 months of dx), and 14 samples from chronic ITP (after 6 months of dx).
