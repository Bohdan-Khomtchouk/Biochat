TITLE
hTERT promotes cell adhesion and migration independent of telomerase activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 6 human cell lines stably over-expressed specific gene or empty vector, and searched for differently expressed genes after gene over-expression as compared to empty vector.

DESIGN
mRNA levels were compared as following pairs: U2OS+hTERT vs U2OS+vector; U2OS+hTERTmut vs U2OS+vector; VA-13+hTERT vs VA-13+vector; VA-13+hTERTmut vs VA-13+vector.
