TITLE
mRNA expression data from primary untreated neuroblastoma tumour samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miR-17-92 microRNA cluster is often activated in cancer cells, but the identity of its targets remains largely elusive. Here we examined the effects of activation of the entire miR-17-92 cluster on global protein expression in neuroblastoma cells. In this dataset we deposit global mRNA expression data obtained form primary neuroblastoma tumour cells. This data was used to demonstrate negative correlation between TGFB target gene expression and expression of the miR-17-92 cluster.

DESIGN
Expression of different TGFB target genes was correlated to miR-17-92 expression using Spearman's Rank statistics in 40 tumours. A correlation heatmap was calculated to visualize the inverse relation between miR-17-92 expression and TGFB target gene expression.
