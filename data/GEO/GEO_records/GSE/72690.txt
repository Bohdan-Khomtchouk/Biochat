TITLE
Genome-wide analysis reveals positional-nucleosome-oriented binding pattern of pioneer factor FOXA1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By analysis of ChIP-exo of FOXA1 in LNCaP,  we find that an astonishing genome-wide " well-positioned " configuration prevalently occurs between FOXA1 motif and the dyad of nucleosome. Here we performed ChIP-seq data of eight chromatin remodelers and found a higher occupancy of these remodelers on these well-positioned FOXA1 motif sites. Together, our results support a positional-nucleosome-oriented accessing model, in which FOXA1 can examine each underlying DNA nucleotide and be able to sense all potential motifs regardless if they face inward or outward to histone octamers along the DNA helix axis.

DESIGN
We have performed ChIP-seq of eight chromatin remodeler factors.
