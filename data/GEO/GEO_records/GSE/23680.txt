TITLE
Expression data from hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal liver tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assay of gene expression pattern differences between liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue from the same mouse by microarray in 4 separate mice injected with recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector

DESIGN
4 Mice (M24, M48, M50, M60) were necropsied at 18 months post-injection of AAV-vector, and livers removed.  Tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue were identified and dissected for RNA extraction.
