SUMMARY
Purpose: RNA editing by ADAR1 is essential for hematopoietic development. The goals of this study were firstly, to identify ADAR1-specific RNA-editing sites by indentifying A-to-I (G) mismatches in RNA-seq data compared to mm9 reference genome in wild type mice that were not edited or reduced in editing frequency in ADAR1E861A editing deficient mice. Secondly, to determine the transcriptional consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Fetal liver mRNA profiles of embryonic day 12.5 wild-type (WT) and ADAR1 editing-deficient (ADAR1E861A) mice were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate (biological replicates), using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites were identified as previously described by Ramaswami G. et al., Nature Methods, 2012 using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA). RNA editing sites were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14,484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of > 0.94 between biological triplicates per genotype. Approximately 4.4% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver, with a LogFC≥1.5 and p value < 0.05. A profound upregulation of interferon stimulated genes were found to be massively upregulated (up to 11 logFC) in ADAR1E861A fetal liver compared to WT. 6,012 A-to-I RNA editing sites were identified when assessing mismatches in RNA-seq data of WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of fetal liver transcriptomes and A-to-I RNA editing sites, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. A-to-I RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 and is required to suppress interferon signaling to endogenous RNA.
