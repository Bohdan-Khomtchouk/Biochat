TITLE
Gene expression profiles of CARM1 overexpression in MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify ERalpha-target genes affected by overexpression of the histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 in breast cancer cells. The roles of CARM1 in ERalpha+ breast cancer was not well characterized. Therefore, we created a Dox inducible CARM1 overexpressing MCF7 cell line where CARM1 is overexpressed by 2 fold to determine the created a Dox-inducible CARM1 overexpressing MCF7 cells for evaluation of the global effects of CARM1 on Eralpha-target gene expression.

DESIGN
MCF7-tet-on-CARM1 clone 13 were treated under 4 conditions: DMSO; Dox; E2 (10nM); Dox+E2. In Dox+E2 condition, cells were pre-treated with Dox for 5 days before treating with E2 for 4 hours. 3 biological replicates were included and total of 12 samples were analyzed.
