TITLE
Bortezomib resistance in CCRF-CEM cell line [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used in severel different hematological malignancies. Resistance to this drug is still poorly understood. In order get more insight in the resistance mechanism, we developed several bortezomib resistant subclones of the CCRF-CEM T-ALL cell line. On these subclones comparative Genome hybridization (arrayCGH) for DNA copy number analysis gene expression and micro-RNA expression arrays were performed.

DESIGN
We performed comparative Genome hybridization (arrayCGH) for DNA copy number analysis on four different bortezomib resistant subclones of the CCRF-CEM cell line. The resistant subclones were compared to the parental CCRF-CEM wildtype cell line and reference DNA.
