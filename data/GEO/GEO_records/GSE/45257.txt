TITLE
Gene expression of Alveolar Soft Part Sarcomas [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a soft tissue sarcoma with poor prognosis. We analysed primary and metastatic ASPS samples to elucidate candidate molecular pathways involved in tumor pathogenesis. Differential gene expression analysis revealed the neural origin for ASPS and implication of fusion genes expression in the pathogenesis of ASPS.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted, cleaned up, and eluted using the RNeasy MiniKit and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit, respectively (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The total RNA yield per sample ranged from 191ng to 2ug. cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, ligation, and extension (DASL) expression assay (Illumina) was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions on a panel comprising 24,526 probes for a total of 18,631 genes (Human Ref-8 Expression; BeadChip).
