TITLE
Nef transfection of Jurkat T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Jurkat T cell line was transfected with SIV Nef controlled by an unducible promoter system. Nef was induced by addition of 10 micromolar pronasterone A and gene expression values were determined after 24 hrs. Control Jurkat cells were untransfected and treated with 10 micromolar pronasterone A and gene expressio values were determined after 24 hrs. Keywords: SIV Nef, Jurkat, pronasterone A

DESIGN
Experimental conditions: 24 hr SIV Nef expression at physiological concentrations in T cells. Controls: Non-transfected. 24 hr.
