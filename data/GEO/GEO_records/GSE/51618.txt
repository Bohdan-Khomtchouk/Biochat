TITLE
Gene expression profiling of non-invasion and invasion NFPAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The application of gene expression profiling is to investigate the pathogenesis of aggressive NFPAs. And to identify biomarkers that could play a key role in aggressive behavior of NFPAs

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured among pituitary glands,  non-invasion NFPAs and invasion NFPAs

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
