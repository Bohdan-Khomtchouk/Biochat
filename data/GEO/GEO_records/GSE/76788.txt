TITLE
Comparative Methylome Analyses Identify Epigenetic Regulatory Loci of Human Brain Evolution [methylation]

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis ; Macaca mulatta ; Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens ; Hoolock leuconedys

SUMMARY
We report the application of DNA sequencing technology for high-throughput sequencing of mix bis-PCR products totally 38 based on bisulfate treated DNA from human, chimpanzee, gibbon, macaque and crab eating macaque profrontal cortex tissues.

DESIGN
Mix bisulfate PCR products from 1 tissues, 23 individula humans, 2 individual chimpanzees, 1 individual gibbons, 7  individual rhesus macaques and 5 crab eating macaques were sequenced by using MiSeq
