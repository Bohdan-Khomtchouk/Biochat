TITLE
ChIP-chip of E. coli K-12 MG1655 with antibody against ArgR-8myc, Lrp-8myc, and TrpR-8myc under various conditions.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We integrated transcription factor binding regions and mRNA transcript abundance to elucidate the ArgR, Lrp, and TrpR regulon experimentally. To measure transcription factor binding at a genome scale, we employed a ChIP-chip method to derivative strains of  E. coli K-12 MG1655 harboring ArgR-8myc, Lrp-8myc, or TrpR-8myc under various conditions.

DESIGN
A twelve ChIP-chip study under six separate culture conditions.  The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 371,034 oligonucleotide probes spaced 25 bp apart (25-bp overlap between two probes) across the E. coli genome.
