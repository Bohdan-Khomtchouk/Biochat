TITLE
A receptor protein links plant cell wall surveillance with hormone signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The growth and shape of plants is mainly defined by the properties of their cell walls, which dynamically adapt to internal and external cues. Therefore, the cell wall is under constant surveillance to relay feedback information to the cell interior. However, very little is known about how cell wall signaling is integrated with intracellular growth regulation. Here, we have identified a receptor-like protein, RLP44, which conveys information from the cell wall to the brassinosteroid hormone signaling pathway by interacting with the regulatory receptor-like kinase BAK1. This conditional RLP44-mediated signaling activation is required for normal development and stress responses, requires functional brassinosteroid receptor, but is partially independent of the hormone ligand. We sought to identify transcriptional changes in the PMEIox transformant in which an altered pectin modification leads to an induction of the brassinosteroid signalling pathway. In addition we determined which fraction of these expression changes was reverted in the cnu1 and cnu2 suppressor mutants of PMEIox, respectively. Complete transcriptome analysis was performed on Col-0 wild-type as well as the PMEIox transformant and the cnu1 and cnu2 suppressor mutant seedlings grown in the dark for four days.

DESIGN
3 Biological replicates of etiolated seedlings grown for 4 days in the dark were harvested on successive weeks.
