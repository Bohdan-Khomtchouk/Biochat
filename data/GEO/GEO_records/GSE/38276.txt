TITLE
Global Analysis of Carbohydrates Utilization of the Alkaline Hemicellulytic Bacteria Bacillus sp. N16-5

ORGANISM
Bacillus sp. N16-5

SUMMARY
Alkaline hemicellulytic bacteria Bacillus sp. N16-5 has abroad substrate spectrum and exhibits great growth ability on complex carbohydrates. In order to get insight into its carbohydrate utilization mechanism, global transcriptional profiles were separately determined for growth on glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, galactomannan, xylan, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose by using one-color microarrays.

DESIGN
Substrate induced gene expression was measured when culture was grown on glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, galactomannan, xylan and CMC to mid-logarithmic phase.
