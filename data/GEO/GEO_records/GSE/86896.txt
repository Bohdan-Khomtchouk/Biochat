TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses for the CSC-like properties under monolayer and sphere culture conditions in 293T and MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to verify the CSC-like properties in 3D spheres of 293T cells as compared to monolayer, MCF-7 breast cancer cells under monolayer and sphere culture conditions were used as a control.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of the 293T and MCF-7 cells [monolayer (mMCF-7 and m293T) and sphere (sMCF-7 and s293T) culture conditions] were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
