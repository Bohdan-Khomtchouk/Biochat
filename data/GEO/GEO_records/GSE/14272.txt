TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide on Mycobacterium bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG str. Pasteur 1173P2

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Mycobacterium bovis BCG GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Mycobacterium bovis BCG to hydrogen peroxide, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Transcriptome study

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of hydrogen peroxide. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three hydrogen peroxide-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 10 and 60 min exposures.
