TITLE
Characterizing the wound healing response that drives human epidermal maturation on transcriptome level

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We collected biopsies from patients undergoing split-thickness skin graft harvesting. The first biopsy was collected from the intact skin before wounding and the second and third from the donor site wound on 14th and 21st day post-operatively. A genome-wide microarray was then executed from each sample, and the gene profiles of each time point were compared.

DESIGN
12 samples from 4 patients were analyzed

PLATFORM
