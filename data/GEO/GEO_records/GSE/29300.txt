TITLE
Effect of endoglin loss on embryoid bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic sten cell-derived embryoid bodies following endoglin knock out. Loss of endoglin leads to profound reduction of key hematopoietic regulators including SCL, LMO2, Gata2, and TGF-Î² signaling molecule ALK-1. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying hemangioblast and primitive hematopoietic development.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from differentiated day 3 EBs of endoglin knock out ES cells were compared to wild type E14 control ES cells.
