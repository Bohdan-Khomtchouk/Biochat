TITLE
Genomic comparison of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) clinical isolates of the Beijing family and clinical isolate HN878 dosR::hyg derivatives versus Mtb laboratory strain H37Rv ATCC27294

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Genomic comparisons among different lineages Mtb isolates.

DESIGN
Laboratoy strain Mtb H37Rv was compered to nine Mtb clinical isolates of the Beijing lineage. One, two or three  replicates were performed for each comparison. Laboratory strain Mtb H37Rv was also compared to two laboratory, genetically-modified derivates from Mtb HN878 clinical isolate in which one copy of the dosR gene was inactivated. Two replicates were performed for each comparison.
