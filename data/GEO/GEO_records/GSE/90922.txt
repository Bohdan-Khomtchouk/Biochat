TITLE
Expression data in JDCaP prostate cancer xenograft model before and after expression of AR splice variants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous study using nude rats revealed that the parental JDCaP xenografts predominantly expressed full-length androgen receptor (AR) whereas the relapsed JDCaP xenografts after castration acquired AR splice variants including AR-V7 and ARv567es. To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of AR splice variants in the JDCaP model, we performed microarray analysis using RNA samples of the xenografts without castration (Parent), the relapsed xenografts overexpressing full-length AR and AR-V7 (ARhiV7hi), and the relapsed xenografts expressing ARv567es (ARv567es).

DESIGN
The JDCaP xenografts without castration (Parent), the relapsed JDCaP xenografts after castration which overexpressed full-length AR and AR-V7 (ARhiV7hi), and which expressed ARv567es (ARv567es), were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (n = 3 each). The Parent samples were used as a control.
