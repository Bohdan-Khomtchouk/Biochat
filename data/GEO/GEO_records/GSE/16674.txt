TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in miR-34a overexpressing K562 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-34a is strongly induced upon TPA-induced megakaryocyte differentiation of K562 cells. To investigate the gene networks regulated by this miRNA during the process of differentiation we performed gene microarray analysis in K562 cells overexpressing miR-34a or a control sequence.

DESIGN
K562 cells were transfected by nucleofection (Amaxa) with a miR-34a mimic (Dharmacon) or a control sequence with no homology to human genes. 24 hours post-transfection total RNA was extracted using trizol and hybridized on Affimetrix microarrays for comparing gene expression.
