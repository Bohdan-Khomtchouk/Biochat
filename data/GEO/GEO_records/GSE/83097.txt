TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RNAs isolated from WT and ZIP7-depleted human mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the roles of ZIP7 in hMSCs , we performed a gene expression microarray analysis for the RNAs isolated from WT and ZIP7-depleted hMSCs

DESIGN
Duplicate experiments were performed for WT and ZIP7 knock-down human mesenchymal stem cells. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Qiazol (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocols.
