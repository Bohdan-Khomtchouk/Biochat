TITLE
Expression data from primary mesangial cells stimulated with DNA and RNA ligands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extrarenal viral infections commonly trigger glomerulonephritis mostly in association with immune complex disease. The immunoglobulin component of immune complexes can activate glomerular cell Fc receptors but whether complexed viral nucleic acids contribute to glomerular inflammation remains unknown. Glomerular mesangial cells express TLR3 but lack TLR7-9, hence, it is unclear whether mesangial cells can recognize and respond to viral ssRNA or DNA. Here we studied the immune responses activated by 3P-RNA (5'Triphosphate RNA) and Non-CpG DNA (Double stranded DNA) in primary mesangial cells (PMC). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression that induced by 3P-RNA and Non-CpG DNA. Keywords: diffrent ligands

DESIGN
PMC were stimulated with 3P-RNA and Non-CpG DNA for 6 hours and then total RNA was isolated for hybridization to MOE430_2 arrays.
