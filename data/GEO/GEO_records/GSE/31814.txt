TITLE
c-myc-3'RR/p53+/- mice lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
c-myc-3'RR mice prone to develop Burkitt lymphoma (BL) were crossed with p53+/- mice in order to obtain c-myc-3'RR/p53+/- mice. These mice develop a wider spectrum of lymphoma including BL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and plasma cell lymphoma (PCL). Transcriptoma analysis of these lymphomas is investigated in these arrays.

DESIGN
Four different plasma cell lymphoma (PCL1-4), three different mantle cell lymphoma (MCL1-4) and four different Burkitt lymphoma (BL1-4) were compared.
