TITLE
Global gene profiling of (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-induced neuronal death

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of adult-onset dementia with severe intellectual deterioration and is characterised by the accumulation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and the presence of hyperphosphorylated microtubule- associated protein, tau. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) – a polyphenolic catechin found in green tea leaves, not only acts as a proteasome inhibitor, it is also involved in neuroprotection.

DESIGN
A total of 7 RNA samples were analyzed. Cultured murine primary cortical neurons were treated with 1uM EGCG for 24h (n=3) in addition to the vehicle control (n=4).
