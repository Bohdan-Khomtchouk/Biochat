TITLE
Global MEF2 target gene analysis in cardiac and skeletal muscle reveals novel regulation of DUSP6 by p38MAPKMEF2 signaling [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identfification of MEF2A target genes using ChIP-exo and RNA-seq in skeletal muscle and primary cardiomyocytes. MEF2 plays a profound role in the regulation of transcription in cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages. To define the overlapping and unique MEF2A genomic targets, we utilized ChIP-exo analysis of cardiomyocytes and skeletal myoblasts. Of the 2783 and 1648 MEF2A binding peaks in skeletal myoblasts and cardiomyocytes, respectively, 294 common binding sites were identified. Genomic targets were compared to differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq analysis of MEF2A depleted myogenic cells.

DESIGN
The effect of MEF2A gene silencing on gene expression in myoblasts was assessed at 48 hr DM. Up and downregulated genes were then compared to MEF2A target genes identified in ChIP-exo analysis of  48 hr DM C2C12 myoblasts cells and primary cardiomyocytes.
