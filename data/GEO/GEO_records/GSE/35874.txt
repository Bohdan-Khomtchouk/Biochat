TITLE
Zebrafish Globin Locus (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of  H3K4me3 modifications, Gata1 binding, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in zebrafish adult red blood cells

DESIGN
Zebrafish red cells from 10 adults were isolated for each ChIP-seq reaction. The red cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA fragements bound by specific proteins were enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total Gata1 and  H3K4me3 (Millipore Cat. No. 17-614) as previously described in Lee et al 2006.
