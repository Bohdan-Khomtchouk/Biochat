TITLE
Gene expression profiling in periimplantation mouse uterine luminal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray analysis to determine the differential gene expression profiles in mouse uterine luminal epithelium between preimplantation gestation day 3.5 and postimplantation gestation day 4.5, and investigeate the molecular mechanism of the establishment of uterine receptivity and embryo implantation. Uterine luminal epithelium (LE) is critical for the establishment of uterine receptivity during embryo implantation. Many genes are known to have differential expression in the periimplantation LE  but the global profiling of the altered genes in the periimplantation LE is unknown. To fill in this knowledge gap, microarray analysis was performed in gestation day 3.5 (D3.5, preimplantation) and D4.5 (postimplantation) mouse LE from natural pregnancy. There were 382 significantly upregulated and 245 significantly downregulated genes ( > 2 fold, P < 0.05) in the D4.5 LE.

DESIGN
There are 6 samples. 3 for gestation day 3.5 uterine luminal epithelium, the other 3 for gestation day 4.5 uterine luminal epithelium
