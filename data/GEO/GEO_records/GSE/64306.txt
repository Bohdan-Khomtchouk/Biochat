TITLE
MicroRNA profiling by array of human urinary sediments from IgAN patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed a microRNA expression analysis in urine sediments from 18 IgAN patients, 6 healthy subjects and 8 disease controls(including 4 membranous nephropathy patients and 4 minimal change disease patients). Pathologic diagnosis of all IgAN patients was included in grades I–V by light microscopy according to the grading system of Lee et al. And we have identified a set of deregulated microRNAs with potential diagnostic value to identify patients with IgAN.

DESIGN
Using microarray-based technology, We have performed a microRNA expression analysis in urine sediments from 18 IgAN patients(IgAN Group), 4 membranous nephropathy patients(MN Group), 4 minimal change disease patients(MCD Group) and 6 healthy subjects（HC Group). The IgAN Group was comprised of 6 IgAN I-II Grade patients, 6 IgAN III Grade patients and 6 IgAN IV-V Grade patients according to the grading system of Lee et al. And we have identified a set of deregulated microRNAs with potential diagnostic value to identify patients with IgAN.
