TITLE
Genetic, Molecular and Physiological Basis of Variation in Gut Immunocompetence

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gut immunocompetence involves immune, stress, and regenerative processes. To investigate the determinants underlying inter-individual variation in gut immunocompetence, we perform enteric infection of 140 Drosophila lines with the entomopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila and observe extensive variation in survival. Using genome-wide association analysis, we identify several novel immune modulators. Transcriptional profiling further shows that the intestinal molecular states of resistant and susceptible lines differ, already before infection, with one transcriptional module involving genes linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism contributing to this difference. This genetic and molecular variation is physiologically manifested in lower ROS activity, lower susceptibility to ROS-inducing agent, faster pathogen clearance and higher stem cell activity in resistant versus susceptible lines. This study provides novel insights into the determinants underlying population-level variability in gut immunocompetence, revealing how relatively minor, but systematic genetic and transcriptional variation can mediate overt physiological differences that determine enteric infection susceptibility.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of whole guts of female adults from different lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) was performed under two conditions: fed on sucrose or infected with Pseudomonas entomophila.
