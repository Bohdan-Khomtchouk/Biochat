TITLE
Synthetic Fire Ant Venom Transcriptosome Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media. Solenopsin B added at a concentration equivalent to the IC50, 13 micro Molar.  Triplicate cultures were prepared at two separate time points, 1 and 6 hours. Keywords: Transcriptosome analysis employing DNA/cDNA glass microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, U937 cell and Sol B treated U937 cells at two time points: 1 and 6 hours post exposure.  Biological replicates: 3, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL3494 UHN Human 19K EST array
