TITLE
Mouse Spontaneous C3H/HeJ AA Skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to develop a transcriptomic description of affected alopecic skin from aged C3H/HeJ mice.  Affected skin from 3 mice was compared to skin from similarly aged but unaffected C3H/HeJ mice.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates from 3 separate affected mice compared with 3 biological replicate controls from 3 unaffected mice
