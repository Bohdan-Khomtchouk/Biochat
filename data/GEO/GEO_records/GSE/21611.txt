TITLE
Oscillating gene expression determines competence for periodic branching in the Arabidopsis root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Oscillation Zone (OZ) of unsynchronized roots was disected and divided into an upper (OZ2) and lower (OZ1) half . Samples were ordered according to DR5:GUS expression as analyzed by real time PCR to find periodic expression patterns

DESIGN
Seedlings were grown for 5 days. 39 individual roots were dissected for RNA extraction. These microarray samples profile a specific region of the root tip designated as the Oscillation zone. Arrangement of the samples in the following order: OZ1-1, OZ1-4, OZ1-23, OZ1-14, OZ1-17, OZ1-2, OZ1-6, OZ1-13, OZ1-15, OZ1-16, OZ1-10, OZ1-32, OZ1-3, OZ1-31, OZ1-22, OZ1-35, OZ1-19, OZ1-9, OZ1-33, OZ1-20, OZ2-4, OZ2-23, OZ2-14, OZ2-6, OZ2-13, OZ2-15, OZ2-10, OZ2-32, OZ2-22, OZ2-35, OZ2-19, OZ2-9, OZ2-20, OZ2-36, OZ2-39, OZ2-21, OZ2-40, OZ2-38, OZ2-1, was used to identify periodic expression patterns.
