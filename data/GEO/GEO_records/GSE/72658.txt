TITLE
Effect of muscle-specific ATF4 gene knockout (ATF4 mKO) on skeletal muscle mRNA levels in aged mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For additional details see Ebert et al, Identification and Small Molecule Inhibition of an ATF4-dependent Pathway to Age-related Skeletal Muscle Weakness and Atrophy.

DESIGN
Quadriceps femoris muscles were harvested from 22-month-old muscle-specfic ATF4 knockout (ATF4 mKO) mice and littermate controls.  mRNA levels in ATF4 mKO muscles were normalized to levels in littermate control muscles.
