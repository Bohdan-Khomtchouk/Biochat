TITLE
H. hepaticus infection and liver cancer

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of mice infected with Helicobacter hepaticus and links to liver cancer We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying H. hepaticus induced liver cancer Keywords: disease model

DESIGN
Mice with tumors were compared to mice with infection only (comparison 2) and mice infected were compared to control mice (comparison 1)
