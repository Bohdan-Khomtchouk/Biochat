TITLE
Identification of target genes of ABI3 [SAP]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ABI3 is a key regulator of seed development in Arabidopsis and other plants.To identify DNA fragments (promoters) bound by ABI3 we performed array based ChIP analysis.

DESIGN
Five ChIP-chip experiments were performed with chromatin of seeds of Arabidopsis and an anti-ABI3 antibody directed against a N-terminal fragment of ABI3, raised in rabbits. Non precipitated chromatin (input) served as control.
