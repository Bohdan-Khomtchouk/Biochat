TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in sublines of DU145 human prostate cancer cells created through in vivo metastatic selection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DU145 human prostate cancer cells were injected into the prostate of nude mice and cells metastasizing to lymph node (LN1) grown and experiment repeated to make LN2-4. DU145 human prostate cancer cells were injected into the tail vein of nude mice and cells metastasizing to lung (ivLU1) grown and experiment repeated to make ivLU2-4.

DESIGN
8 groups representing individual cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL2700 Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip
