TITLE
An In Vitro Versus In Vivo Toxicogenomics Investigation of Pre-natal Exposures to Tobacco Smoke [Dams, Prenatal offspring]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pregnant mice (Dams) were exposed to cigarette smoke or filtered air. Lung tissue and RNA were harvested from the lungs of the Dams and their offspring and underwent transcriptomic analysis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Cigarette smoke vs. filtered air. 3 biological replicates for each condition of Dam female mice and Prenatal offspring mice.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
