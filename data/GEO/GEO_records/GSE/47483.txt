TITLE
H3K27me3 is maintained at a reduced level in Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs express a truncated form of Suz12 fused to Beta-galactosidase. These cells maintain a reduced level of H3K27me3 despite this mutation to a core component of PRC2, unlike Eed-/- ESCs whose H3K27me3 is ablated.

DESIGN
Two ESC lines mutant in genes of core components of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 were assessed for H3K27me3 by ChIP-seq, as compared to a wild type ESC line.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
