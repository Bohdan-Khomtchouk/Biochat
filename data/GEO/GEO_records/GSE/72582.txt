TITLE
High-specificity bioinformatics framework for epigenomic profiling of discordant twins reveals specific and shared markers for ACPA and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Study of changes in DNA Methylation in monozygotic Rheumatoid Arthritis discordant twins and ACPA+/- discordant twins

DESIGN
Five healthy twin pairs discordant for presence of antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA). Secondly, profiling seven twin pairs discordant for ACPA-positive RA.
