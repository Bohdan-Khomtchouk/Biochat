TITLE
Ionizing radiation induced changes of miRNA expression in A549 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs induced by radiation. Human A549 lung cancer cells were irradiated (2Gy/day for consistent 3days) and miRNA signature was identified that distinguished between control and radiation treated samples.Irradiated and un-irradiated A549 cells were harvested after 48 hr of treatment and microarray analysis was performed. Expression of five miRNAs (miR-30a, miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-30d, and miR-30d) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming variability between control and radiation treated A549 cells.

DESIGN
Radiation induces miRNA expression in A549 cell line was measured at 48 hours after exposure to doses of  2Gy for 3days.
