TITLE
Fine mapping of regulatory loci for mammalian gene expression using radiation hybrids II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped regulatory loci for nearly all protein coding genes in the mammalian genome using microarray measurements from a panel of mouse/hamster radiation hybrids. Proof of principle transfection experiment.  Pcdh7 (a gene identified as being a regulator of many genes) is transfected into A23 and HEK cells and compared to A23 and HEK cells transfected with an empty vector.  Upregulated genes predicted by our approach are compared with the transfection experiments Keywords: tranfection, regulation of gene expression
