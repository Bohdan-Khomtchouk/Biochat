TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of miR-1 transfected HeLa and NPC-TW01 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of miR-1 inducing apoptosis, we performed cDNA expression microarray analysis to identify the candidate miR-1 regulating genes that are involved in apoptosis.

DESIGN
NPC-TW01 cells were transfected with miR-1 or miR-negative control for 40 hours, their total RNA were isolated from the cells and hybridized to an Agilent human whole genome oligo 4 x 44 K microarray. HeLa cells were transfected with miR-1 or miR-negative control for 40 hours, their total RNA were isolated from the cells and hybridized to an Agilent human whole genome oligo 4 x 44 K microarray.
