TITLE
A label-retaining but unipotent cell population resides in biliary compartment of mammalian liver.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells with slow proliferation kinetics that retain the nuclear label over long time periods – the label-retaining cells (LRCs) – represent multipotent stem cells in a number of adult tissues. Since the identity of liver LRCs (LLRCs) had remained elusive we utilized a genetic approach to reveal LLRCs in normal non-injured livers and characterized their regenerative properties in vivo and in culture. We found that LLRCs were located in biliary vessels and participated in the regeneration of biliary but not hepatocyte injury. In culture experiments the sorted LLRCs displayed an enhanced self-renewal capacity but a unipotent biliary differentiation potential. Transcriptome analysis revealed a unique set of tumorigenesis- and nervous system-related genes upregulated in LLRCs when compared to non-LRC cholangiocytes. We conclude that the LLRCs established during the normal morphogenesis of the liver do not represent a multipotent primitive somatic stem cell population but act as unipotent biliary progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptome comparison of label-retaining biliary epithelial cells and non-label-retaining biliary epithelial cells (cells with GFP expression were compared to the cells without GFP). Illumina HiSeq 2000 was used to analyze 8 RNA samples from 4 mice.
