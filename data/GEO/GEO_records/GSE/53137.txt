TITLE
lncRNAs expression signatures of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are an important class if pervasive genes involved in a variety of biological functions. LncRNAs have been recently implicated as having oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles. To further investigate the function of lncRNA in gastric cancer, we use lncRNA microarray to describe LncRNAs profiles in 6 pairs of human gastric adenocarcinoma and the corresponding adjacent nontumorous tissues.

DESIGN
The experimental samples  are divided into two groups(normal and tumor) to compare lncRNA expression profiling of those
