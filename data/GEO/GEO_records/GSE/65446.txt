TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and cardiac-specific Bmi1 deletion [human]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the primary cause of Dilated Cardiomyopathy in heart samples from DCM-diagnosed patients who had undergone heart transplant (hDCM), we set out to identify differentially expressed genes by massively parallel sequencing of heart samples.

DESIGN
Methods: Heart mRNA profiles from DCM-diagnosed patients who had undergone heart transplant (hDCM) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
