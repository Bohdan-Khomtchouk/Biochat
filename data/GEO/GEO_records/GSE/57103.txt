TITLE
Molecular and Histological Characterization of Age Spots

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we used immunohistochemical analysis and microarray analysis to investigate the mechanism underlying the development of age spots, focusing on the expression of specific markers associated with the functions and proliferation of melanocytes and keratinocytes

DESIGN
10 subjects of phototypes I or II (all female, age = 53-70) with various sizes and colors of age spots on their forearms were recruited for the study. Four mm whole skin punch biopsies were taken from age spots on the forearm of each subject and from a perilesional control area in the vicinity of each age spot.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
