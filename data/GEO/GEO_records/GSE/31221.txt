SUMMARY
A critical problem in biology is understanding how cells choose between self-renewal and differentiation. To generate a comprehensive view of the mechanisms controlling early hematopoietic precursor self-renewal and differentiation, we used systems-based approaches and murine EML multipotential hematopoietic precursor cells as a primary model.  EML cells give rise to a mixture of self-renewing Lin-SCA+CD34+ cells and partially differentiated non-renewing Lin-SCA-CD34- cells in a cell autonomous fashion. We identified and validated the HMG box protein TCF7 as a key regulator in this self-renewal/differentiation switch, and it operates in the absence of canonical Wnt signaling. We found that TCF7 is the most downregulated transcription factor when CD34+ cells switch into CD34- cells using RNA-Seq. We subsequently identified the target genes bound by TCF7 using ChIP-Seq. We show that TCF7 binds to Runx1 (Aml1) promoter region, and RUNX1 and TCF7 co-regulate. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggests that TCF7 primarily acts as a positive regulator of genes preferentially expressed in CD34+ cells. Consistent with this possibility, knocking-down TCF7 represses many up-regulated genes in Lin-CD34+ cells. Finally a network of up-regulated transcription factors of CD34+ cells which defines the self-renewing state was constructed. These studies in EML cells demonstrate fundamental cell-intrinsic properties of the switch between self-renewal and differentiation, and yield valuable insights for manipulating HSCs and other differentiating systems.
