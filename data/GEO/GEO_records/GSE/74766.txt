TITLE
Optimizing sgRNA structure to improve CRISPR-Cas9 knockout efficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current commonly used single-guide RNA (sgRNA) structure has a shortened duplex compared with the native bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA)â€“transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) duplex. Here we show that modifying the sgRNA structure by extending the duplex length and mutating the fourth T of the continuous sequence of Ts (which is the pause signal for RNA polymerase III [pol III]) to C or G significantly, and sometimes dramatically, improves knockout efficiency in cells. In addition, the new sgRNA structure also significantly increases the efficiency of more challenging genome-editing procedures, such as gene deletion, which is important for inducing a loss-of-function in non-coding genes.

DESIGN
Gene editing efficiency of different sgRNA design in TZM-bl cells
