TITLE
Comparison of BRG1 reexpression, TSA treatment and 5dAzaC treatment on gene expression in human NCI-H522 NSCLC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription was assessed in the human H522 NSCLC cell line after reexpression of BRG1, one of the mutually exclusive subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, by adenovirus infection, after treatment with 5 micromolar 5-deAzacytidine or after treatment with 100nM Trichostatin A.  Control treatments included infection with adenovirus expressing GFP and treatment with DMSO4 (vehicle control).  The goal of the experiment was to identify target genes of the SWI/SNF complex and compart them to changes induced by DNA methylation and histone acetylation modifiers.

DESIGN
One biological replicate of each treatment; 4 technical replicates of each treatment.
