TITLE
Gene expression signature predictive of rapid response to imatinib mesylate in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays performed on tumor samples obtained before and after imatinib mesylate (IM) therapy.  Rapid responding (to IM) samples were compared to non-responding/stable disease samples as measured by CT scan measurements to identify a gene signature that can predict rapid response to IM.

DESIGN
54 samples, 29 pre-treatment biopsy samples, 25 post-treatment/post-surgery tumor samples from Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
