TITLE
Profiling of mouse muscle stem cells aging and activation upon skeletal muscle injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Utilizing glycerol intramuscular injections in M. musculus provide a models of skeletal muscle damage followed by skeletal muscle regeneration. In particular, glycerol-induced muscle injury triggers accute activation of skeletal muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. However, aging dramatically impairs the regenerative capacity of satellite cells. We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of young and old satellite cells in the non-proliferative and activated state, freshly isolated to non-injured or damaged muscles, respectively. Our goal was to uncover new regulatory signaling specific to satellite cells entry into the activation and myogenic program that are affected with age.

DESIGN
Satellite cells were isolated in either quiescent / non-proliferative or activated state from uninjured or 3 days after glycerol-induced injury of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and quadriceps, respectively. Young (2-4 months old) and old (20-24 months old) wildtype C57BL/6J male were used, with five to six biological replicates per group.
