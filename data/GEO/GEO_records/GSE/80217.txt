TITLE
The TfoX regulon of Vibrio cholerae

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the TfoX regulon of V. cholerae WT strain A1552 compared to a ΔhapR and ΔqstR strain using RNA-seq to better understand the protein's function.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of a V. cholerae strain A1552-TntfoX without (-ara) and with arabinose (+ara) induction and of strains A1552ΔhapR-TntfoX (+ara) and A1552ΔqstR-TntfoX (+ara). 3 independent biological replicates are provided for each bacterial strain. The bacteria were grown to high cell density and in the absence or presence of arabinose (to induce TfoX).
