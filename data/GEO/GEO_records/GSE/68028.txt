TITLE
The alteration of DNA methylation driven by HIV infection based on a pair of monozygotic twins (MeDIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the relationship between genome-wide DNA methylation pattern and HIV infection using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation - microarray method. A pair of monozygotic twins was recruited: one of the twins was infected with HIV while the other was not. The immunoprecipitated CpG-methylated DNA from HIV positive subject (test) and from HIV negative subject (input control) were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3 respectively

DESIGN
The methylated genomic DNA fragments from HIV+ and HIV- twins were hybridized on the same chip since the identical genetic background
