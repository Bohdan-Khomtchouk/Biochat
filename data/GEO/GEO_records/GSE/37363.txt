TITLE
TET2 loss-of-function mutations associate with a DNA hypermethylation signature in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression in TET2 mutant and Wild type patients. We performed an integrated analysis of global DNA methylation and gene expression data to investigate the effects of DNA hypermethylation on gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 4 TET2mut and 5 TET2wt  were isolated using standard RNAeasy kit protocol (Qiagen). Their gene expression profiles were obtained using the[HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix.
