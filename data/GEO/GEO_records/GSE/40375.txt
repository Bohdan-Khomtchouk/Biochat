TITLE
Lack of local vitamin D synthesis accelerates breast cancer development after Cyp27B1 gene ablation in mammary epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ablated Cyp27b1 mice showed no difference in mammary development but tumorigenesis was significantly accelerated. Cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell cycle progression and survival markers were upregulated by Cyp27b1 ablation, a pattern confirmed by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Triplicate samples each of control mice and Cyp27b1 knockout mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
