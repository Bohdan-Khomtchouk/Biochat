TITLE
Microarray analysis of CD14+ CD163high CD160high cells in human intestinal lamina propria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several innate immune cell subsets have recently been identified to maintain gut homeostasis in both human and mice. Among these subsets, CX3CR1high CD11b+ CD11c+ cells contribute to intestinal tolerance through various mechanisms in mice. However, whether tolerogenic innate myeloid cells are present in the human intestine is not clearly defined. In this manuscript, we identified an intestinal myeloid cell subset possessing tolerogenic ability. HLA-DRhigh CD14+ CD163high cells in the human colon were divided into two subsets based on CD160 expression: CD163high CD160high and CD163high CD160low cells. Both cell subsets exhibited high levels of IL-10 production and high phagocytic activities. CD163high CD160high cells suppressed effector CD4+ T cell proliferation by a Foxp3+ Treg cell induction-independent mechanism. We further observed that the number and suppressive activity of these cells were profoundly decreased in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, CD163high CD160high cells in the UC patients showed inflammatory phenotype, such as increased expression of IL6, CD80, and CD86, accompanied with decreased IL10RB expression. Our results highlight that a tolerogenic CD163high CD160high cell subset might be implicated in the prevention of UC development.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of pooled lamina propria cells (LPCs) (n=12) and human blood CD14+ monocytes (n=7) were performed using Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit, 4x44K (G4112F) as one-color experiments.
