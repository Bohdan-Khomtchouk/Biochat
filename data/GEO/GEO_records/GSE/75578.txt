TITLE
Expression data from the kidney tissue of Han:SPRD rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Han:SPRD rats carry a missense mutation in Anks6 (also called Pkdr1), leading to an R823W substitution in SamCystin, a protein that contains ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif (SAM). Han:SPRD Cy/+ rats develop a slowly progressing form of PKD which resembles phenotypically human ADPKD. We used microarrays to examine alterations in the renal gene expression in a rodent model of PKD, namely the Han:SPRD rat.

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression analysis on mRNA transcripts from kidney tissues from ten-week old heterozygous Han:SPRD Cy/+ and wild-type +/+ male rats.
