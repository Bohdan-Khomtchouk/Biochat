TITLE
Neuropilin-1 expressing macrophages exert antitumor activity in HER2 positive breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We reported that NRP-1 expression on CD4+ T cells was probably induced by NRP-1 transfer from macrophages to T cells. In HER2+ BC, NRP-1 expressing TIIs correlated with better clinical outcomes.

DESIGN
Examination of monocytes and monocyte derived macrophages.

PLATFORM
