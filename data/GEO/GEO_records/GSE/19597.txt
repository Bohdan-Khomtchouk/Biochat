TITLE
Deregulated expression programs in the hypomorphic Dnmt3b mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The function of Dnmt3b, of which deregulated activity is linked to several human pathologies, was studied using Dnmt3b hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced catalytic activity. Microarray analysis of deregulated expression programs in the hypomorphic Dnmt3b mutant mice (m3/m24) was combined to an analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in the illegitimate activation of a specific set of genes.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and thymus tissues isolated from 12.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc, respectively, wild-type and hypomorphic embryos (129SvJae x C57BL/6 hybrid genetic background). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN), amplified, labeled, and hybridized following a previously described protocol (Le Brigand et al., Nuc Acid Res, 2006). Total RNA was coupled with Cyanine 3 or 5 and then hybridized in competition with reference RNA composed of a pool of total RNA isolated from wild-type thymus or MEF cells (thymus, n=5; MEF, n=5); two dye-swap were realized leading to the analysis of 18 microarrays for thymus (2 microarrays were excluded for unsufficient quality) and 20 for MEF cells. Arrays were then scanned with Agilent G2565AA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies).
