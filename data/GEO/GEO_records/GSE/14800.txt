TITLE
Lasp1 gene disruption is linked to enhanced cell migration and tumor formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic loss of Lasp1 alters the expression of other genes associated with cell motility/attachment, and/or other cellular functions.  Results provide new information showing that loss of Lasp1 leads to up- and down-regulation of genes involved in cell motility/attachment/growth. Keywords: Genotype comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from  Lasp1-/- MEFs compared to Lasp1+/+ MEFs.
