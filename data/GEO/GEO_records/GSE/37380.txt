TITLE
Stable and inducible expression of Fbxo25  in Flp-In-293 cells: control vs. tetracycline treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of human Flp-In-293-WT-FBXO25 or Flp-In-293-∆F-FBXO25 cells comparing non treated cells vs. tetraciclyne treated for 24 and 48 hours. Flp-In-293-∆F-FBXO25 cells when induced express the non functional protein (without F-box domain).  The objective of the study was to identify genes up or down-regulated when Fbxo25 wild-type or Fbxo25 lacking F-box domain is superexpressed.

DESIGN
Flp-In-293 WT and ∆F cells with and without tetracycline treatment.  Two timepoints, two replicates each.
