TITLE
Global gene expression induced by CP1020 (Cyanopeptolin) in zebrafish eleuthero-embryo (Danio rerio)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Cyanobacteria produce various cyanotoxins, which can cause severe effects to other organisms. Microcystins, one group of such toxins, primarily produced by species of Microcystis, are strong hepatotoxins and inhibit potently protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Microcystin is the most studied cyanotoxin, however, others are not investigated. Eutrophication of water bodies promotes the occurrence of toxic algal blooms and since a anthropogenic caused increase in eutrophication events can be observed, it is becoming increasingly important to study the consequences and to increase the knowledge on toxins associated with algal blooms. Recently a new cyanobacteria toxin from a Microcystis strain, CP1020, was described. CP1020 belongs to the class of cyanopeptolins and its toxicity was shown to be comparable to that of microcystin (Gademann et al., 2009). It is a strong protease inhibitor inhibiting trypsin in the picomolar range (IC50 = 670 pM) and effects survival of the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus (LC50) 8.8 μM (Gademann et al., 2009). Nothing is known, however, about the toxicity of CP1020 to fish. Furthermore, no information is available on the toxic modes of action, in addition to the proteinase activity. Consequently our study has the aim to elucidate the modes of action of CP1020 on zebrafish eleuthero-embryos. By using a microarray technique, we will analyse alterations of global gene expression by CP1020 at two different concentrations. Thereby, we hope to elucidate the whole array of affected biological pathways to elucidate the mechanisms by which CP1020 affect fish.

DESIGN
Gene expression in zebrafish eleuthero-embryos was measured after exposure for 96h to 100 ug/L and 1000 ug/L CP1020 or to the respective controls. A total of 12 arrays (Agilent 4 × 44 K Zebrafish microarray) were used, including four for the solvent control group, four for the 100 μg/L and four for the 1000 μg/L CP1020 dose group.
