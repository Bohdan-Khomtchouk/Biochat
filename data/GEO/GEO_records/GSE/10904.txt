TITLE
Expression data from wildtype and alb/cre liver-conditional Pdss2 knockout mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Utilizing M. musculus as a model of mitochondrial dysfunction provides insight into cellular adaptations which occur as a consequence of genetic alterations causative of human disease.  We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of liver-conditional knockout mice for Pdss2 compared with loxP controls. Our goal was to detect concordant changes among clusters of genes that comprise defined metabolic pathways utilizing gene set enrichment analysis. Keywords: Wildtype vs mutant comparison as a method for studying contributors to disease processes.

DESIGN
Liver from three biological replicates each of wildtype and coenzyme Q biosynthetic mutant M. musculus were used as sources of total RNA for hybridization to Affymetrix whole-genome microarrays.  Comparison of the data was intended to reveal metabolic pathway alterations downstream of the mutation.
