TITLE
Early gibberellin responses in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim is to identify early gibberellin responsive genes in a gibberellin deficient strain such as ga1-3. Such genes are likely regulated by DELLA proteins which are master gibberellin repressors. DELLA proteins are rapidly degraded after gibberellin treatment, but their direct target genes still need to be elucidated. Keywords: hormone response, gibberellin treatment
