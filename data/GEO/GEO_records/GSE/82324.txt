TITLE
Expression data from yeasts under non-caloric restriction (NR), caloric restriction (CR) and rapamycin treatment (RM)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed microarrays to identify change of gene expression under NR, CR, and RM and found differentially expressed genes between each condition.

DESIGN
We harvested yeast cells under each condition at day 5 after inoculation.  Microarray was performed in biological triplicate on cells under NR, CR and RM.
