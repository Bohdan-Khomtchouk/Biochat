TITLE
Differential expression of skeletal muscle genes between normal and pale, soft and exudative (PSE) turkey meat.

ORGANISM
Meleagris gallopavo

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine differential gene expression of turkey breast muscle regarding development of PSE meat defect. Genetically unimproved, random-bred (RBC2) turkeys representing turkeys from 1966, which are smaller and grow slower than modern turkeys, were raised at the Michigan State University (MSU) Poultry farm and harvested at 22 week of age. Breast meat was collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Percent marinade uptake at 24h post-slaughter of each sample was determined. The highest (n=6) and the lowest (n=6) marinade uptake were classified as normal and PSE, respectively. Differentially expressed genes between normal and PSE was identified using TSMLO microarray and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Forty-one oligos were differentially expressed (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1). Candidate genes and pathways associated with development of PSE in turkey were suggested for further experiment to gain greater comprehension about this meat quality defect.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: normal vs PSE; Biological replicate: n=6 for each condition; Birds were randomly assigned to an array and hybridizations were performed in random order.
