TITLE
Expression data from RA-FLSs with PMPs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelet microparticles (PMPs) are closely related to the activity of rheumatoid arthritis, and promote the migration and invasion of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). In order to identify the possible mechanisms of the promotion effect on migration and invasion of RA-FLS by PMP, we used microarray analysis to detect the gene expressions of RA-FLSs after treatment with PMPs.

DESIGN
RA-FLSs after treated with or without PMPs were selected for RNA extraction and detection on Affymetrix

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
