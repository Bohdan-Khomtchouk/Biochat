TITLE
Intestinal MSI-1 CLIP-CHIP used for pool 2 gene prioritization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
UV-crosslinked mouse intestine was immunoprecipitated for MSI1. Similar CLIP protocol was performed in Park et al. 2015 Journal of Experimental Medicine except RNA was random primed and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays 1.0ST array. Fold enrichment was ranked over IgG.

DESIGN
UV-crosslinked mouse intestine was immunoprecipitated for MSI1. Similar CLIP protocol was performed as in Park et al. 2015 Journal of Experimental Medicine except RNA was random primed and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays 1.0ST array. Fold enrichment was ranked over IgG.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
