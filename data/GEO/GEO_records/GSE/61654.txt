TITLE
miRNA profiling of Macaca mulatta intact duodenum samples following chronic Delta9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) treatment to SIV infected rhesus macaques

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study describes miRNA expression in intact duodenum following chronic delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) administration to SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Chronic Δ9-THC administration to uninfected macaques significantly and positively modulated intestinal miRNA expression by increasing the total number of differentially expressed miRNAs from 14 to 60 days post infection (DPI). At 60DPI, ~28% of miRNAs showed decreased expression in VEH/SIV compared to none in the THC/SIV group. Furthermore, compared to the VEH/SIV group, THC selectively upregulated the expression of miR-10a, miR-24, miR-99b, miR-145, miR-149 and miR-187 previously shown to target proinflammatory molecules. NOX4, a potent reactive oxygen species  generator was confirmed as a direct miR-99b target. A significant increase in NOX4+ crypt epithelial cells was detected in VEH/SIV compared to the THC/SIV group. We speculate that miR-99b-mediated NOX4 downregulation may protect the intestinal epithelium from oxidative stress-induced damage.
