TITLE
miRNA profiling of Macaca mulatta intact duodenum samples following chronic Delta9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) treatment to SIV infected rhesus macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The study describes miRNA expression in intact duodenum following chronic delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) administration to SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Chronic Δ9-THC administration to uninfected macaques significantly and positively modulated intestinal miRNA expression by increasing the total number of differentially expressed miRNAs from 14 to 60 days post infection (DPI). At 60DPI, ~28% of miRNAs showed decreased expression in VEH/SIV compared to none in the THC/SIV group. Furthermore, compared to the VEH/SIV group, THC selectively upregulated the expression of miR-10a, miR-24, miR-99b, miR-145, miR-149 and miR-187 previously shown to target proinflammatory molecules. NOX4, a potent reactive oxygen species  generator was confirmed as a direct miR-99b target. A significant increase in NOX4+ crypt epithelial cells was detected in VEH/SIV compared to the THC/SIV group. We speculate that miR-99b-mediated NOX4 downregulation may protect the intestinal epithelium from oxidative stress-induced damage.

DESIGN
Twelve age and weight matched male Indian rhesus macaques were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 (n=1) received vehicle (1:1:18 of emulphor : alcohol : saline) and no infection. Group 2 (THC only, n=3) animals received twice daily intramuscular injections of Δ9-THC and no infection. Group-3 THC/SIV, (n=4) animals received twice daily injections of vehicle and were infected intravenously with 100TCID50 of SIVmac251. Group-4 (VEH/SIV, n=4) animals received twice daily injections of Δ9-THC similar to group 1 for four weeks prior to SIV infection. Duodenal pinch biopsies were collected before infection and thereafter at 14 and 30 days post infection. All animals were necropsied at 60 days post SIV infection. ~100 ng of total RNA was first reverse transcribed and preamplified according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. microRNA expression profiling was performed using TaqMan ®OpenArray® Human microRNA panels. Data analysis was performed using ExpressionSuite® software. Data was normalized to three endogenous controls (RNU44, RNU48 and snoU6). Delta CT values were calculated by subtracting individual miRNA CT values from an average of all three endogenous controls.  Comparisons were made between preinfection and all three treatment groups at 14, 30 and 60 DPI. To determine the effect of chronic THC treatment during SIV infection, comparisons were also made between VEH/SIV and THC/SIV at all three time points.
