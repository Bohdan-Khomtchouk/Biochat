TITLE
microRNA expressions in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was undertaken to identify microRNAs differently expressed by intestinal type of gastric cancer using miRNA microarray. The miRNA expression in the intestinal type of gastric cancer depending on H. pylori infection suggest that different gastric cancer pathogenesis could be exist between H. pylori-positive and -negative gastric cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cancerous region and non-cancerous regions in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues of intestinal type gastric cancer patients who were H. pylori-positive (n=8) or -negative (n=8).
