TITLE
Modeling tumor subtypes in vivo using lineage restricted transgenic shRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression analysis from two genetically engineered mouse models of osteosarcoma determine the expression profile of mouse osteosarcoma Human osteosarcoma (OS) is comprised of three different subtypes: fibroblastic, chondroblastic and osteoblastic. We previously generated a mouse model of fibroblastic OS by conditional deletion of p53 and Rb in osteoblasts. Here we report an accurate mouse model of the osteoblastic subtype using shRNA-based suppression of p53. Like human OS, tumors frequently present in the long bones and preferentially disseminate to the lungs; features less consistently modeled using Cre:lox approaches. Our approach allowed direct comparison of the in vivo consequences of targeting the same genetic drivers using different technology. This demonstrated that the effects of Cre:lox and shRNA mediated knock-down are qualitatively different, at least in the context of osteosarcoma. Through the use of complementary genetic modification strategies we have established a model of a distinct clinical subtype of OS that was not previously represented and more fully recapitulated the clinical spectrum of this human tumor.

DESIGN
4 primary tumors from Cre:lox OS model; 4 primary tumors from shRNA OS model.
