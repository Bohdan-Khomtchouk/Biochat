TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the diversity of expression states within melanoma tumors, we obtained freshly resected samples, dissagregated the samples, sorted into single cells and profiled them by single-cell RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Tumors were disaggregated, sorted into single cells, and profiled by Smart-seq2. *Raw data files absent for samples GSM1851356 and GSM1851494.* **Submitter declares reads will be made available through dbGaP.** Please note that the processed data file (melanoma_single_cell_revised_v2.txt) contains two additional sample characteristis ( " classification (based on inferred cnvs) " and " cell types for non-malignant cells " ).
