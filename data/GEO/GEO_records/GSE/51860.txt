TITLE
Microarray analysis of Shp2hep-/- and Shp2Floxed/Floxed liver samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of Shp2hep-/- and Shp2Floxed/Floxed liver samples to gain global molecular insights how Shp2 is involved in hepatic metabolism.

DESIGN
Two liver samples from both Shp2hep-/- and Shp2Floxed/Floxed were subjected to microarray using Illumina system, Shp2hep-/- were albumin-cre postitive.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
