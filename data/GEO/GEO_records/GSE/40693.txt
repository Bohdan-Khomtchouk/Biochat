TITLE
Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to cinnamaldehyde

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
Cinnamaldehyde is a natural antimicrobial and has been found to be effective against many foodborne pathogens including Escherichia coli O157:H7. Although its antimicrobial effects have been well investigated, limited information is available on its effects at the molecular level. Sublethal treatment at 200 mg/l cinnamaldehyde inhibited growth of E. coli O157:H7 at 37oC and for ≤ 2 h caused cell elongation, but from 2 to 4 h growth resumed and cells reverted to normal length. To understand this transient behaviour, genome-wide transcriptional analysis of E. coli O157:H7 was performed at 2 and 4 h exposure to cinnamaldehyde. Drastically different gene expression profiles were obtained at 2 and 4 h. At 2 h exposure, cinnamaldehyde induced overexpression of many oxidative stress-related genes, reduced DNA replication, and synthesis of protein, O-antigen and fimbriae. At 4 h, many cinnamaldehyde-induced repressive effects on E. coli O157:H7 gene expressions were reversed and oxidatve stress genes were nolonger differentially expressed.

DESIGN
Duplicate E. coli O157:H7 cultures with or without 200 mg/l cinnamaldehyde were incubated at 37°C for ≤ 4 h. Cinnamaldehyde-induced changes in gene expression profiles were compared at 2 and 4 h using Affymetrix Ginechip 2.0 microarrays.
