TITLE
Transcriptional targets of Shewanella oneidensis HnoC (SO_2540)

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
To identify the transcriptional targets of the DNA-binding response regulator HnoC (SO_2540), mRNA transcript levels in Shewanella oneidensis were measured using whole genome microarray analysis. Transcript levels were compared between WT Shewanella oneidensis and a hnoC deletion strain.

DESIGN
Transcript levels of a WT and hnoC deletion strain were measured after 15 hrs growth, 4 independent replicates were performed for each strain
