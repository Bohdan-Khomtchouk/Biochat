TITLE
Specific, Durable and Accurate Gene Expression Signatures of Radiation Response in Mice and Humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous work has demonstrated the potential for peripheral blood (PB) gene expression profiling for the detection of disease or environmental exposures.    We have sought to determine the impact of several variables on the PB gene expression profile of an environmental exposure, ionizing radiation, and to determine the specificity of the PB signature of radiation versus other genotoxic stresses. Keywords: peripheral blood, gene expression study, radiation reponse

DESIGN
We have sought to determine the impact of several variables on the PB gene expression profile of an environmental exposure, ionizing radiation, and to determine the specificity of the PB signature of radiation versus other genotoxic stresses.  Neither genotype differences nor the time of PB sampling caused any lessening of the accuracy of PB signatures to predict radiation exposure, but sex difference did influence the accuracy of the prediction of radiation exposure at the lowest level (50 cGy).   A PB signature of sepsis was also generated and both the PB signature of radiation and the PB signature of sepsis were found to be 100% specific at distinguishing irradiated from septic animals.  We also identified human PB signatures of radiation exposure and chemotherapy treatment which distinguished irradiated patients and chemotherapy-treated individuals within a heterogeneous population with accuracies of 90% and 81%, respectively. Human and Murine samples used in models Peripheral blood was collected from patients prior to and 6 hrs following total body irradiation with 150 to 200 cGy as part of their pre-transplantation conditioning.  For additional comparison, peripheral blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and an additional cohort of patients prior to and 6 hrs following the initiation of alkylator-based chemotherapy alone (without radiotherapy).
