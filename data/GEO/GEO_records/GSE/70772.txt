TITLE
Expression data from colon cancer cell HCT116 mouse xenograft - Control vs. traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus-treated conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify biomarkers regulated by traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus Fischer Bge. var. mongolicus Bge. Hsiao in colorectal cancer. We have identified several differentially expressed genes including microRNAs using Affymetrix HTA-2.0 array. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from colon cancer cell line HCT116 grafted into nude mice. The mice was treated either water or traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus for 28 days. These data are used to obtain 1425 genes that are differentially expressed in response to Astragalus membranaceus treatment.

DESIGN
16 total samples were analyzed. The data was RMA-normalized and differentially expressed genes were selected using GeneSpring. Genes with a p < 0.05 and a fold-change > 1.5 were selected.
