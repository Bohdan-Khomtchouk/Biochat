TITLE
Pancreatic islet expression profiling in diabetes prone C57BLKS/J mice vs C57BL6/J mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BLKS/J mice are susceptible to diabetes, because of islet dysfunction, whereas C57BL6/J mice are not. Differences in gene expression between the two strains may account for this sensitivity. Furthermore these differences may only be evident in the hyperstimulated (diabetic or hyperglycemic) state. To this end profiling islets from these two strains cultured in both low and high glucose may reveal the underlying mechanism. Keywords: Mouse strain comparison under different culture conditions

DESIGN
In the study presented here, pancreatic islets from 20 mice grown in low and high glucose conditions were assayed for differences in gene expression.  (five C57BLKS/J low glucose, four C57BLKS/J high glucose, six C57BL6/J low glucose, five C57BL6/J high glucose).  Technical replicates are achieved by labeling each sample with both Cy3 and Cy5, and combining the values for each hybridization.
