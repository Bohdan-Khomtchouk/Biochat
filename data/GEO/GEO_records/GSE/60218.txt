TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data of melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B2M losses are seen as an early event, shared by all cell lines presented here

DESIGN
Cell lines were generated from tumor material, differences in T cell recognition were observed and Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on DNA extracted from cell lines SNP analysis of different melanoma cell lines obtained from 2 melanoma patients (3 cell lines from different metastases of one patient with matching germline DNA and 2 cellines from metastases of another patient) show alterations of the B2M gene
