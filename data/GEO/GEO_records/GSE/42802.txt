TITLE
Expression data from IFNbeta-stimulated 293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine which genes are upregulated by IFNbeta stimulation in 293T cells.

DESIGN
We treated 293T cells with recombinant IFNbeta for 12 hrs or left the cells unstimulated.  We then lysed the cells and hybridized the RNA to Affymetrix microarrays.
