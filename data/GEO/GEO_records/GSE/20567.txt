TITLE
Effects of PMA on exon usage of HL60, THP-1, and U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myeloid leukemia cell lines HL60, THP-1, and U937 undergo macrophage-like differentiation after treatment with phorbol ester. To explore genes whose exon usage was altered during macrophage differentiation, we compared exome of PMA-treated (differentated) and vehicle-treated (undifferentiated) myeloid cell lines.

DESIGN
HL60, THP-1, and U937 cells were treated with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA,30nM) or its vehicle (DMSO) for 3 days, and subjected to exome analysis using Affymetrix human exon 1.0ST arrays.
