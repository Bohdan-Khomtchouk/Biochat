TITLE
The role of BPTF in melanoma progression and in response to BRAF-targeted therapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies demonstrate multiple pro-tumorigenic functions for BPTF, and identify it as a novel target for anti-cancer therapy. They also suggest the combination of BPTF targeting with BRAF inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy for melanomas with mutant BRAF.

DESIGN
Parental B16 cells transfected with a control or anti-BPTF shRNAs consitute the comparative arms of this study.Five replicates of each condition was performed.
