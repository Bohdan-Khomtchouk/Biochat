TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of 1M Regions in Glycine max Using Tiling Microarrays

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We report here a transcriptonal analysis in six different organ types of a approximately 1 Mb region in soybean (Glycine max) which is sytenic with legume (Medicago truncatula). We used oligonucleotide tiling microarrays to detecte transcription of over 80% of the predicted genes in both species. We detected differential gene expression in the six examined organ types. Keywords: RNA
