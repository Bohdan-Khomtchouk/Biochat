TITLE
Time-course expression data from HEK293∆RAF1:ER cells stimulated with 4OHT, U0126, CYHX, ActD, EGF, FGF, or IGF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We integrate experimental data and mathematical modelling to unveil how ERK signal duration is relayed to mRNA dynamics.

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected with an inducible form of RAF (∆RAF1:ER) and induced with tamoxifen (4OHT) or stimulated with different growth factors (EGF, FGF, iGF). Effects of RAF signalling were perturbed subsequently or in parallel with MEK inhibtor U0126, translation inhibtor cycloheximide (CYHX) and actinomycin D (ActD).
