TITLE
Whole genome survey of the obesity model lean congenic mice B6.C-D7Mit353

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the differential expression between the obesity model lean congenic B6.C-D7Mit353 (1) and the background C57BL/6J strains, in four different tissues of male mice: Brain, GWAT (Gonadal White Adipose Tissue), liver and muscle (gastrocnemius). From the 32,381 mouse genes covered by the Applied Biosystems AB1700 microarray system, we identified 330 genes passing FDR at 5% and 188 genes passing FDR at 1%, in any one of the four tissues examined. None of the genes that passed FDR testing were in the congenic donor region. 65 genes from the 8 megabases congenic region were assayed; only six genes (Thrsp, Kctd14, Myo7a, Capn5, Dgat2 and Mtap6) passed statistical significance filtering but not FDR filtering.

DESIGN
Brain, GWAT, liver and muscle RNA were extracted from biological triplicates of the congenic B6.C-D7Mit353 (Brain samples: Br353C1b, Br353C4a, Br353C5b; Liver samples: L571, L409, L552; Adipose samples: GWAT407, GWAT409, GWAT571; Muscle samples: Gas409, Gas407, Gas552) and the background C57BL/6J strains (Brain samples: BrB1b, BrB3b, BrB5b; Liver samples: Lb570, Lb572, Lb573, GWAT572; Adipose samples: GWAT615, GWAT411; Muscle samples: Gas408, Gas615, Gas570). Digoxigenin-UTP labeled cRNA was generated and linearly amplified from 1 ug of total RNA. Array hybridization, Chemiluminescence detection, image acquisition and analysis were performed using Applied Biosystems Chemiluminescence Detection Kit and Applied Biosystems 1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocol.
