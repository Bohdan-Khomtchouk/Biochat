TITLE
Gene expression of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the early stationary phase

ORGANISM
Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633

SUMMARY
Naturally bacteria are commonly forced to remain in stationary phase. There is no increase in cell mass, however, cell division keep on. Vibrio (V.) parahaemolyticus is an aquatic bacterium capable of causing foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks all over the world. So far, little is known about whole genomic expression of V. parahaemolyticus in the early stationary phase compared with the phase of exponential growth. Since under starvation cell sizes decrease and endogenous metabolism reduces, genes are considered to be highly repressed in the stationary phase. However, our data shows in total 172 induced genes, while 61 genes were repressed in the early stationary phase compared with exponential phase. In fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism functional category only induced genes were found, whereas in three other metabolic functional groups appeared no significant up-regulated genes (adjusted P-value < 0.05). Genes in two metabolic functional categories remained stable in the early stationary phase. DAVID analyses were carried out exploring the gene regulation. In total, ten functional categories showed a total up-regulation in early stationary phase, while only three metabolic functional categories showed a down-regulation and four categories showed stably in early stationary phase.

DESIGN
Early stationary phase gene expression was detected in total bacterial RNA of V. parahaemolyticus. Two phases (exponential phase and early stationary phase) were used in 8 biological replicates. Gene expression  in exponential phase was used for normalization.
