TITLE
RNA-Seq Versus Oligonucleotide Array Assessment of Dose-Dependent TCDD-elicited Hepatic Gene Expression in Mice [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dose-dependent hepatic gene expression was examined following repeated exposure (every 4 days for 28 days) to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). These data were used to examine the effect of repeated TCDD exposure as well as compare the performance of RNA-Seq and Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays for detection and identificatioin of differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Five biological replicates for each dose (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30) of TCDD and sesame oil vehicle
