TITLE
Kinetics of IFNa response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe finely resolved kinetics of the transcriptional response to IFNa in B cells in vivo.  Temporal changes in expression of the most robustly induced ISGs were analyzed across 23 (15min - 15hrs) timepoints. Most ISGs reach peak induction at approximately 2hrs and generally in a synchronus manner. These analses provide insight into the regulatory network structure of IFN responses.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 10,000U IFNa according to time course profile. Splenic B cells were sorted by FACS directly into TriZol and gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
