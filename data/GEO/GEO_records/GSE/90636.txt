TITLE
Identification of NAD+ capped mRNAs in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the identification of NAD-RNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under two distinct growth mediums.

DESIGN
RNA-seq libraries (in triplicate) were generated from total RNA that was treated with ADP-ribosylcyclase to select for NAD-RNAs and compared to mock-treated samples.Â  After ADPRC treatment, RNA was biotinylated using click chemistry and a pull down using streptavidin beads was performed.

PLATFORM
