TITLE
Transcription factor TWIST-1 overexpression in acute myeloid leukemia cell line U937

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alterations of TWIST-1 expression are often seen in solid tumors and contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, studies concerning its pathogenic role in leukemia are scarce. Here we show that TWIST-1 is a new candidate gene contributing to leukemogenesis of myeloid leukemia. We used array as one tool to determine gene expression profiles of control and TWIST-1-overexpressing U937 cells.

DESIGN
U937 cell line was transduced with TWIST-1 or empty vector. GFP+ cells were sorted. Microarray was performed at GMINIX in Shanghai. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Canada) and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, German), including a DNase digestion treatment. RNA concentrations were determined by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo, America). RNA was labeled using the GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling and Controls Kit combined with the Ambion® WT Expression Kit. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, America).
