TITLE
Tissue damage signals repurpose NF-κB, AP-1 and Smad3 to direct a Rev-erb sensitive wound healing program in macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A complex damage signal promotes co-localization of NFκB and Smad3 at Rev-erb-sensitive enhancers and drives expression of genes characteristic of alternate polarization states in the same cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin mark H3K27Ac, transcription factors PU.1, cFos, SMAD3, and p65 were assessed by ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq was used to measure gene expression in C57BL/6 and ReverbDKO mice and in in-vivo wounds
