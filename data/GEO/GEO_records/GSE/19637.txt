TITLE
Incisional hernia recurrence through genomic profiling: a pilot study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin and intact fascia were collected from 15 normal control (NC) patients with no hernia history and 18 patients presenting for recurrent incisional hernia (RH) repair. Microarray analysis was performed using whole genome microarray chips on NC (n = 8) and RH (n = 9). These samples were further investigated using a pathway-specific PCR array containing fibrosis-related genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from skin and fascia of patients with a history of recurrent ventral hernias and a control group. There were no replicates for the same source material for the same patient.
