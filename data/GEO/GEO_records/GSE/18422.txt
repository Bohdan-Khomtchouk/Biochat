TITLE
Gene expression based, effect of DNA minor groove binding ligand on human cells in response to ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radiation induced DNA damage initiates a complex series of overlapping responses responsible for the maintenance of genome integrity. The data reports the expression analysis in response to DNA minor groove binding ligand with an emphasis on its ability to afford better protection in cells exposed to ionizing radiation.
