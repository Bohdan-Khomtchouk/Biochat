TITLE
MDM2 facilitates adipocyte differentiation through CRTC-mediated activation of STAT3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this setup we have used RNA-seq to define which cAMP-induced genes are dependent on activity of the JAK kinases or MDM2. Also, we mapped binding of the coactivator CRTC2 to DNA upon forskolin stimulation.

DESIGN
Global gene expression analysis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as well as p53-/- and p53-/-;mdm2-/- MEFs treated with JAK inhibitor and/or forskolin. Furthermore, we have performed ChIP on CRTC2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stimulated with forskolin and pretreated with either vehicle or the JAK inhibitor P6.
