TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Populus x canadensis in Response to Drought Stress

ORGANISM
Populus x canadensis

SUMMARY
To investigate the response of poplar hybrids to drought, leaves were collected from plants to which water was suspended for 8 and 13 days. After measuring the respective relative water content, RNAs were isolated from leaves of moderately and severely droughted plants and from control plants, and Illumina RNA sequencing was performed to analyze RNA synthesis in these tissues.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of leaves of poplar plants subjected to 8 or 13 days of water deprivation. Sequence data were generated by deep sequencing, on four replicates (2 per 2 hybrids), using Illumina HiSeq2000.
