TITLE
Effect of Gnas knockout on mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin lesions from adult mice with epidermal conditional deletion of heterotrimeric G protein Galpha s in cytokeratin 14 positive cells, compared with control mouse skin. Epidermal Gnas ablation leads to skin defects, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Results provide insight into role of Galpha s in the regulation of stem cells from the skin.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression following Gnas deletion from the mouse epidermis were analyzed. Skin from four independent mice of each wild type (control) and Gnas epidermal knockout (Gnas eKO) were analyzed.
