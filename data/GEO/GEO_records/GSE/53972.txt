TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the liver of obese AIM+/+ and AIM-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate differential preventive roles of the blood apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM)  protein in fat deposition and hepatocarcinoma development, we have performed microarray analysis to assess putative difference in expression of genes related to carcinnogenesis in the liver of AIM+/+ and AIM-/- fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for various periods.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the liver of AIM+/+ and AIM-/- mice fed an HFD for 0, 6, 12, and 20 weeks, and analyzed by microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
