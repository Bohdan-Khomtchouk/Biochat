TITLE
Comparison of extravillous trophoblast cells derived from human embryonic stem cells and from first trimester human placentas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the present study was to  characterize HLA-G-positive cells derived from human embryonic stem cells treated with BMP4 for five days and compare them to HLA-G positive cells derived from human first trimester placentas

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells were cultured with BMP4 in the absence of FGF2 for 5 days. They were then dispersed and separated into HLA-G+ and HLA-G-, TACSTD2 positive cells by using immunomagnetic bead separation.  First trimester human placental samples from 8-12 weeks gestation were enzymatically separated into single cells, and then also separated into HLA-G+ and HLA-G-/TACSTD2+ cell populations
