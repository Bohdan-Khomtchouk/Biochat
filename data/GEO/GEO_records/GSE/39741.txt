TITLE
Mepazine inhibitor effects DLBCL cell line HBL1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The medicinal active phenothiazine mepazine acts as a small molecule inhibitor of the MALT1 protease. Mepazine selectively inhibits cleavage activity of recombinant and cellular MALT1 by a noncompetitive mechanism. MALT1 activity is required for NF-kappaB signaling and survival of aggressive lymphoma belonging to the ABC-DLBCL (activated B-cell-type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) entity. Gene expression profiling was carried out in the ABC-DLBCL cell line HBL1 after treatment with mepazine (20 microM) for 6, 12, and 24 hr. Mepazine inhibits anti-apoptotic NF-kB signaling and thereby survival of these cells.

DESIGN
Using Agilent 2-color gene expression microarrays (GPL10332) mepazine-treated HBL1 cells were compared with DMSO in the control channels.
