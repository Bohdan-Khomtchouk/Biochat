TITLE
Mixed biofilm - cluster transfer O1 to O139

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
These experiments were performed to show serogroup conversion in Vibrio cholerae from O1 to O139 in a mixed communities / biofilms. For this purpose, V. cholerae O1 El Tor A1552 and VCO139-Kan strain (a MO10 derivative; O139 serogroup) were grown on crab shell fragments to induce natural competence for transformation. Transformants were selected on LB+Kan+Rif plates. O139 positive transformants have undergone a full exchange of the O1 region by the O139 region. This implies an exchange of an at least 32 kb spanning O1 genomic region by more than 42 kb of the O139 region. The transformation experiment was done at least five independent times; data from four experiments are shown; per experiment one to three clones were analysed by CGH with two experimental replicates each. A genotyping experiment design type classifies an individual or group of individuals on the basis of alleles, haplotypes, SNP's. Keywords: all_pairs, array CGH
