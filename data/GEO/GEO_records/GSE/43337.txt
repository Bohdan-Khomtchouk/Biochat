TITLE
Impaired neutrophil recruitment in CXCL5 knockout mice during Mtb infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in WT mice strain C57BL/6 (WT¬ù) and the CXCL5 knockout (KO)

DESIGN
Two color arrays with dye swaps, RNA harvested at day 0 (d00, no infection) and day 21 (d21); 5 mice per experimental group. RNA from each experimental group was pooled. The e0, e8, e9 and eX are internal experimental run/labels of equivalent biological replications of the experiments.
