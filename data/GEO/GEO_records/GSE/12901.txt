TITLE
Expression data from early Bovine embryo

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The process of early development of mammals is subtly and accurately controlled by the regulation networks of embryo cells. Time course expression data measured at different stages during early embryo development process can give us valuable information by revealing the dynamic expression patterns of genes in genome wide scale. In this study, bovine embryo expression data were generated  at oocyte, one cell stage, two cell stage, four cell stage, eight cell stage, sixteen cell stage, morula, and blastocyst. By comparing this data set with data generated with similar process on other species, we can study the trascriptom under a revolutionary scheme. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Bovine embryos were harvested at successive stage from oocyte to blastocyste. Total RNAs were extracted, amplified and hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL2112 [Bovine] Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array
