TITLE
Proteasome machinery is instrumental in a common gain-of-function program of the p53 missense mutants in cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutant p53 proteins, resulting from the missense mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, possess gain-of-function activities and are among the most robust oncoproteins in human tumors. They are potentially important therapeutic targets. No studies to date have distinguished common, therapeutically relevant mutant p53 gain-of-function effects from effects specific to different mutant variants and cell backgrounds. here we performed RNA-seq analysisin MDA-MB-231 (R280K) upon silencing TP53 or the control siRNA.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 (R280K) cell line was transfected with control or p53 siRNA.So The study comprises one experimental cell line,in triplicate.
