TITLE
Gene transcript alterations exhibited in luminal and basal epithelial compartments with impaired Ror2 signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses revealed distinct gene expression alterations in the luminal and basal epithelial compartments in the absence of Ror2 with marked alterations observed in genes associated with actin filament-based processes and the actin cytoskeletal network.

DESIGN
Given that Ror2 expression resides in both basal and luminal epithelial cells, we wanted to identify compartment-specific functions for Ror2 in coordinating development.   Accordingly, luminal and basal epithelial cell populations from shLUC and shRor2 outgrowths were isolated by FACS separation on the basis of CD24 and CD29 surface marker expression and gene expression analysis was subsequently performed using Agilent microarrays.
