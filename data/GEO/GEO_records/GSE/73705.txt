TITLE
OX40L protects against inflammation-driven fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fibrosis is a leading cause of deaths in industrialized countries and has no effective therapy. We demonstrated that blockade of OX40L prevented inflammation-driven fibrosis affecting the skin and the lungs and promotes regression of established dermal fibrosis in different murine models. To characterize the pathways involved in the protection of skin fibrosis and affected by OX40L blocking, we used microarrays and identified distinct genes differentially expressed between ox40l+/+ and ox40l-/- in the bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis mouse model.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from lesional skin samples of 3 ox40l+/+ and 4 ox40l-/- male mice aged 9 weeks treated with bleomycin for 3 weeks, and were hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
