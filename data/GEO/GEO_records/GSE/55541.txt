TITLE
Human ESC-based modeling of pediatric gliomas by K27M mutation in histone H3.3 variant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are an aggressive form of pediatric brain tumors that arise in the pons in young children thus resulting in significant morbidity and very poor survival. Recent data suggest that mutations in the histone H3.3 variant are often found in these tumors, though the mechanism of their contribution to oncogenesis remains to be elucidated. Here we report that the combination of constitutive PDGFRA activation and p53 suppression as well as expression of the K27M mutant form of the histone H3.3 variant leads to neoplastic transformation of hPSC-derived neural precursors. Our study demonstrates that human ES cells represent an excellent platform for the modeling of human tumors in vitro and in vivo, which could potentially lead to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying neoplastic transformation and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Human ES cells were differentiated to NPCs and lentivirally transduced with a combination of constitutively active PDGFRA (D842V), sh-p53, and WT or K27M mutant form of histone H3.3 variant.
