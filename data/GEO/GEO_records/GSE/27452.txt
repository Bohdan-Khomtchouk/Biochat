TITLE
Genome-wide maps of polyadenylation sites in control and PABPN1kd cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied deep-sequencing based technique, 3'-Seq, to obtain comprehansive maps of poly-A sites in human cells. 3'-Seq was applied to two cell lines (U2OS and RPE-1), in control and PABPN1 knockdown cells

DESIGN
Examination of poly-A sites in control and PABPN1kd cells (in two different cell lines)

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens) GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
