TITLE
Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of phytohormone pathway genes and miRNAs in ABA initiated strawberry receptacle ripening

ORGANISM
Fragaria x ananassa

SUMMARY
We used Illumina sequencing to investigate the global transcriptomic expression of hormonal pathway genes in ABA initiated strawberry receptacle ripening. Expression profiles of hormone synthetic and signaling genes further demonstrated the positive roles of ABA and GA, and the negative role of auxin in receptacle ripening. We also evaluated the transcript profiling of ethylene and JA pathway genes, and the results suggested that both ethylene and JA participated in receptacle ripening. Furthermore, two novel miRNAs and three conserved miRNAs were identified and validated to target genes in ABA and auxin pathways, respectively. Our analyses reveal the molecular mechanism of hormonal regulation during strawberry receptacle ripening. The data also provide an abundant of genetic information for molecular manipulation on non-climacteric fruit ripening.

DESIGN
Sample 1: CK0 (Strawberry fruit two weeks after athesis treated with water, set as day 0); Sample 2: CK5 (fruit treated with water on day 5); Sample 3: CK8 (fruit treated with water on day 8); Sample 4: ABA5 (fruit treated with ABA on day 5); Sample 5: ABA8 (fruit treated with ABA on day 5); Sample 6: NDGA5 (fruit treated with water on day 5); Sample 7: NDGA8 (fruit treated with NDGA on day 8).
