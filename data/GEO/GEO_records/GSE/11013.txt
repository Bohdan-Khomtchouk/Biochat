TITLE
Gene expression rates in a mouse model for Potocki-Lupski Syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify gene(s) that are modified in their relative expression levels in the Potocki-Lupski Syndrome mouse model and map to the rearranged region, i.e. possible candidate genes at the source of the PTLS-like phenotypes shown by the PTLS mouse, we comp Keywords: disease model, expression profiling
