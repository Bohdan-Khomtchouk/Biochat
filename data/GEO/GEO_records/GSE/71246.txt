TITLE
Genome wide expression in liver of young adult (D90) and aged (D456) female C57/BL6 mice in F1 and F3 generations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of diet and ageing in the liver at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that dietary energy would be associated positively with the magnitude of age-related changes in the expression of the liver transcriptome and that such effects would accumulate between generations. Results provide insight into the realtionship between diet across generations and ageing.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from livers of D90 or D456 females in the F1 and F3 generation, following a 6 hour fast.
