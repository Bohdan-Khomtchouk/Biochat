TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Nile tilapia hepatopancreas in different salinity

ORGANISM
Oreochromis niloticus

SUMMARY
In this study, RNA-Seq was used to reveal the differences of molecular pathways in hepatopancreas of O. niloticus adapated to water with salinity of 8 or 16 practical salinity (psu), respectively, with fish at  freshwater as the control,. Significantly changed pathways were mainly related to lipid metabolism, glucose utilization, protein consumption, osmotic regulation, signal transduction and immunology. Based on the tendencies from freshwater to 8 or 16 psu, the differentially expressed gene unions were categorized into eight unique models, which were further classified into three categories which were constant-change (either keep increasing or decreasing), change-then-stable and stable-then-change. In constant-change category, steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, fat digestion and absorption, complement and coagulation cascades were extremely significantly affected by ambient salinity (P < 0.01), indicating that these pathways play pivotal roles in molecular response to salinity acclimation from freshwater to saline water in O. niloticus, and should be the main research focus in the future. In change-then-stable category, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption changed significantly with ambient increasing salinity (P < 0.01), showing these pathways were sensitive to environmental salinity variation, but had a response threshold, and would stop changing once salinity exceeds the threshold. In stable-then-change category, protein export, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, tight junction, thyroid hormone synthesis, antigen processing and presentation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis - keratan sulfate were the top changed pathways (P < 0.01), suggesting that these pathways were not sensitive to salinity variation, but these pathways will respond significantly under salinity exceeding a certain level. The pathways and genes reported in this study laid on a solid foundation for future studies in understanding the underlying mechanism for salinity adaptation of freshwater fish.
