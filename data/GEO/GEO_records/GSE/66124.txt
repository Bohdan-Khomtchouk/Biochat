TITLE
Epigenetic modification and antibody-dependent expansion of memory-like NK cells in human cytomegalovirus-infected individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a starting point for exploring potential differences in gene expression between conventional NK and FcRγ-NK cells, and to screen for genes that might contribute to the enhanced CD16 responsiveness of g-NK cells, we performed gene expression profiling studies on sorted samples of NK cells. NKG2C, NCR, and KIR surface receptors were used to separate FcRγ- NK and conventional NK cells.

DESIGN
Indicated subsets of NK cells were sorted from 4 individual donors using a two-way sorter. RNA extracted from the sorted enriched samples were treated with Dnase and analyzed by DNA microarray (Agilent).
