TITLE
MicroRNA Expression in Human RPE Cells in Culture: Control vs Treated with IFN-γ + TNF-α + IL-1β

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells in culture respond to inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ + TNF-α + IL-1β ) by increasing the expression of many cytokines and chemokines. The goal of this study was to delineate the role of miRNA in this process. We employed microarray analysis to study the effect of inflammatory cytokines on the miRNA expression in HRPE cells.

DESIGN
HRPE cells were treated with a mixture of IFN-γ (100 u), TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 16 hours, and the miRNA expression was analyzed using RNA preparations isolated from control and treated cells. The experiment was repeated. Control samples were labeled with Cy3 while the treated samples with Cy5.
