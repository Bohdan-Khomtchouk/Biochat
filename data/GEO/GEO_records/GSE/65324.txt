TITLE
microRNA expression in parotid acinar cells during terminal differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Terminal differentiation in parotid acini relies on sustained changes in gene expression during the first few postnatal weeks. Little is known about what drives these changes. Expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation. We used both microRNA and mRNA expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation.
