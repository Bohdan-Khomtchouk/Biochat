TITLE
microRNA expression in parotid acinar cells during terminal differentiation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Terminal differentiation in parotid acini relies on sustained changes in gene expression during the first few postnatal weeks. Little is known about what drives these changes. Expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation. We used both microRNA and mRNA expression measurements along with knowledgebased network analysis was used to develop a prospective gene regulatory network that drives differentiation.

DESIGN
laser capture microdissection was used to isolate acinar cells from the parotid at four timepoints in triplicate (E20, P5, P15, and P25). RNA was isolated, and used to measure microRNA expression.
