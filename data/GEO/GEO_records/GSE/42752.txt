TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of normal colon epithelium and colon adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained from colon adenocarcinoma samples (22), corresponding normal colon tissue (22) and cancer-unrelated normal colon tissue using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Approximately 485000 CpG sites were measured in every sample.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 63 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
