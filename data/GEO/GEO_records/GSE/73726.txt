TITLE
Proteomic evaluation of the hepatocyte secretome identifies Fetuin B as a factor linking steatosis to impaired glucose metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment examined the changes in gene expression in heptocytes isolated from mice with normal (non-fatty) livers or mice with simple steatosis induced by short-term high-fat feeding (6 weeks)

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of RNA samples from isolated hepatocytes derived from C57Bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) are compared to four biological replicates of RNA samples from isolated hepatocytes of C57Bl/6 mice fed a normal diet (chow)

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
