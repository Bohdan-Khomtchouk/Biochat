TITLE
A Werner syndrome stem cell model unveils heterochromatin alterations as a driver of human aging

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data throw light upon the effect of WRN deficiency on gene expression and epigenomic modification, which indicates aging-associated changes from both genomic and epigenomic level.

DESIGN
It was compared between WRN+/+ and WRN-/- in hESCs and hMSCs that the gene expression landscapes and epigenetic modifications(H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and  5-methylcytosine).
