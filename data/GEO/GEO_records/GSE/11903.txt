SUMMARY
The success of TNF inhibitors for treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases was previously attributed to blockade of innate immunity.  In a clinical trial using etanercept TNF blocking agent to treat psoriasis vulgaris, we used affymetrix gene arrays to analyze broad gene profiles in lesional skin at multiple timepoints during drug treatment (baseline, and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 12) compared to non-lesional skin.  This analysis created a temporal model of TNF-dependent gene regulation that informs molecular mechanisms of TNF-mediated inflammation.  We identified four gene clusters that were differentially down-modulated during etanercept treatment: the cluster down-regulated most rapidly contained mostly dendritic cell activation genes.  Culturing human keratinocytes with TNF, IFNg and IL-17 generated a list of keratinocyte genes regulated by each cytokine.  The IL-17 pathway genes were strongly down-modulated early, whereas IFNg pathway genes were not down-modulated until final disease resolution at week 12.  Finally, we show that TNF blockade rapidly inhibits IL-12/IL-23 p40 subunit expression, and that p40 neutralization inhibits psoriatic dermal émigré-mediated Th17 polarization.  We hypothesize that etanercept inhibits myeloid dendritic cell production of IL-23, a Th17 survival cytokine, resulting in rapid downregulation of IL-17 pathway genes.  This data links effects of TNF blockade on the innate immune system with the adaptive immune system. Keywords: time-course experiment
