TITLE
Analysis of Hybrid Incompatability between C nigoni and C briggsae

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis briggsae ; Caenorhabditis nigoni

SUMMARY
An introgression of C. briggsae onto the X chromosome of C briggsae results in male sterility.  In order to determine the cause, we sequenced small RNAs from this strain and compared to fertile males of the two parent species.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing was carried out from 200 adult males of each species
