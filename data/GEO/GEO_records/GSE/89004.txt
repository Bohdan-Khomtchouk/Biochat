TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomic profiles of Pseudomonas protegens H78 and its (p)ppGpp0 relA/spoT mutant

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas protegens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiles of  Pseudomonas protegens H78 and its (p)ppGpp0 relA/spoT mutant, which were grown to the late exponential phase (OD600 = 5.0 to 6.0) in the KMB media at 28 Â°C, were assessed by deep sequencing (RNA-seq) on Illumina 2500.

DESIGN
Two bacterial strains, Pseudomonas protegens H78 wild type strain and its (p)ppGpp0 mutant strain, each was replicated three times.

PLATFORM
GPL22592 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Pseudomonas protegens)
