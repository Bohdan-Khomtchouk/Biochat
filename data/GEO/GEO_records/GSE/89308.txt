TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of tumor-specific CD8 T cells in murine and solid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATACseq analysis of dysfunctional CD8 T cells in progressing tumors. The overall goal of this study was to elucidate chromatin states associated with functional unresponsiveness in tumor-specific CD8 T cells in the context of mouse and human tumors. As comparison we also investigated chromatin state dynamics associated with CD8 T cells differentiation to functional effector and memory T cells during an acute listeria infection.

DESIGN
CD8 T cells were sorted by flow cytometry and ATAC-seq was performed.
