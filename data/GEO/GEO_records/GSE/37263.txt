TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of altered gene expression in the neocortex of Alzheimer's disease (gene level)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated genome-wide gene alterations in the temporal cortex of a well-characterized cohort of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) patients using Affymetrix exon arrays.

DESIGN
The AD patients and controls are subjects originally recruited into OPTIMA (Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing). Subjects underwent annual clinical and neuropsychological assessments, including the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). Among subjects who died with autopsy consent given by next of kin, 1 cm3 blocks of grey matter from BA22 were dissected from fresh frozen brains of AD subjects. Tissues from elderly controls, followed longitudinally in life and with CAMCOG scores > 80 at the last assessment before death, were collected. Affymetrix exon array was carried out in 8 control and 8 AD samples. The samples processed in each hybridization run were matched for AD vs. control, sex and postmortem interval (PMI) as far as possible. This submission includes the gene-level analysis.
