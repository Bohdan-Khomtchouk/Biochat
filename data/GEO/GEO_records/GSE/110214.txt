TITLE
Genetic determinants and epigenetic effects of pioneer factor binding [WGBS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) are the core drivers of gene regulatory networks that control developmental transitions and a complete understanding of how they access, alter and maintain specific gene expression patterns remains an important goal. To begin a systematic dissection of the molecular components that either enable or constrain TF activity, we investigated the genomic occupancy of two distinct TFs, the pioneer factor FOXA2 and the pluripotency-associated factor OCT4 (POU5F1), in both endogenous and ectopic settings. We find that, while stable binding of FOXA2 is highly cell type specific and similar to what is observed for most TFs including OCT4, pioneer activity can be distinguished by notable sampling of additional loci that are occupied in alternative lineages. In our ectopic system, FOXA2 binding can be selectively stabilized at previously sampled sites by co-expressing the lineage specific regulator GATA4. Alternatively, we observe minimal influence of chromatin state on discrete, stabilized binding choices for FOXA2 but a strong bias towards open chromatin for ectopic OCT4 targets. Finally, we demonstrate that FOXA2 binding and nucleosome remodeling at silent loci can occur when the cell cycle is halted in G1, but surprisingly subsequent changes in DNA methylation require DNA replication. Taken together, our results provide several new molecular insights that contribute to our basic understanding of gene regulation and pave the way for a more rational use of ectopic TFs for cellular reprogramming.
