TITLE
Structure and Function of a Transcriptional Network Activated by Hog1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cells regulate gene expression using a complex network of signaling pathways, transcription factors and promoters.  To gain insight into the structure and function of these networks we analyzed gene expression in single and multiple mutant strains to build a quantitative model of the Hog1 MAPK-dependent osmotic stress response in budding yeast. Our model reveals that the Hog1 and general stress (Msn2/4) pathways interact, at both the signaling and promoter level, to integrate information and create a context-dependent response. Keywords: Stress response network analysis using genetically modified cells
