flagellin experiment in dcl2-dcl3-dcl4 mutant background-Gene profiling upon biotic stress treatment.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - flagellin experiment in dcl2-dcl3-dcl4 mutant background - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - What are the genes (including primary miRNA transcripts) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? 14-day old seedlings (Col-0 and dcl2-dcl3-dcl4) treated with flg22 (flagellin- derived peptide). Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
