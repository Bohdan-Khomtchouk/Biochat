TITLE
EphrinB2 Regulation by PTH and PTHrP Revealed by Molecular Profiling in Differentiating Osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
With the aim of identifying new pathways and genes regulated by PTH(1-34) and PTH-related protein 1-141 [PTHrP(1-141)] in osteoblasts, this study was carried out using a mouse marrow stromal cell line, Kusa 4b10, that acquires features of the osteoblastic phenotype in long-term culture conditions. After the appearance of functional PTH receptor 1 (PTHR1) in Kusa 4b10 cells, they were treated with either PTH(1-34) or PTHrP(1-141), and RNA was subjected to Affymetrix whole mouse genome array.

DESIGN
Timecourse experiment on Kusa4b10 cell lines, treatment with PTH or PTHrP, collection at 1, 6 and 24 hours NOTE: This work has been published in 2008 (PMID 18627264); Since the original normalised data for this project is unavailable,  the data has been re-normalised using a standard method for GEO submission in 2013. Therefore, the re-normalized data represented in this records may differ slightly from the original normalized data in the publication.
