TITLE
Human IFNG+/- Treg and Tconv transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray used to detail the global gene transcription underlying sorted IFNg+ and IFNg- Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127lo) and Tconv (CD4+CD25-CD127+) for fresh (unexpanded) and 14 day expanded cells from human blood.

DESIGN
Treg and Tconv were FACS isolated from five healthy subjects (median age of 26, range 22-30).  Sorted cells were separated into two groups: the first group was stimulated for 4 hours with PMA/ionomycin and labeled with the IFNg cytokine capture kit (Miltenyi Biotech) followed by FACS isolation of IFNg- and IFNg+ populations. The second set was expanded to day 14 prior to reactivation and cytokine cell capture.  For each IFNg sorted population, cells were pelleted and flash frozen before RNA isolation and processing.
