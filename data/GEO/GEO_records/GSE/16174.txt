Reticulocyte 3 timepoints

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse models have proven invaluable for understanding erythropoiesis. Here, we describe an autosomal recessive inherited anemia in the mouse mutant hem6. Hematologic and transplantation analyses revealed a mild, congenital, hypochromic, microcytic anemia intrinsic to the hematopoietic system that is associated with a decreased red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin to heme ratio, indicative of porphyrin insufficiency. Iron uptake experiments showed that hem6 reticulocytes are defective in heme production, but not cellular iron uptake defects. Male hem6 mice are infertile due to defects in sperm structure and motility. Through positional cloning and BAC complementation, we identified the gene responsible for the hem6 anemia. We hypothesized that the relative deficiency in erythroid-specific mRNAs in hem6 reticulocytes might be due to decreased mRNA stability. Indeed, serial microarray analysis of reticulocytes aged in vitro showed that numerous, abundantly expressed erythroid-specific transcripts decayed at faster rates in hem6 reticulocytes compared to control reticulocytes. Furthermore, these mRNAs also have progressively shorter poly (A) tails, suggesting a mechanism for the increased rate of decay. Keywords: serial time points

DESIGN
Reticulocyte rich blood were collected and cultured ex vivo for 24 hours, samples were collected at 0, 12,24 hours for microarray analysis. There are 3 wild type (wt) biological replicates and 5 mutant (mut) biological replicates in each time point.
