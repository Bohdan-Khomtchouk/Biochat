TITLE
Expression data of cartiliage from CBA and STR/ORT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array profiles were generated from acticular cartilage derived from CBA and Str/ort mice at three ages (8W, 18W, 40W), corresponding to stages prior to, at and late after natural osteoarthritis (OA) onset in OA-prone Str/ort mice.

DESIGN
Two strains of mice, three ages, and three to four biological replicates.
