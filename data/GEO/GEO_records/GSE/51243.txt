TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptome of TEL-JAK2- versus activated NOTCH1 (ICN1)-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The TEL-JAK2 fusion oncogene and the ICN1 activated allele of NOTCH1 are the result of specific chromosomal translocations in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Mouse models of these diseases (TEL-JAK2 transgenic mice; Carron C.  et al. Blood (2000); a bone marrow transplantation model for ICN1-induced T-ALL) were used  to compare the transcriptional program specific to each oncoprotein in mouse models of these leukemias. Tumor load was > 50% leukemic cells in all selected organs.

DESIGN
Leukemic cells were collected from the thymus of terminally-ill TEL-JAK2 leukemic mice and bone marrow of terminally-ill ICN1 leukemic mice. RNA was extracted from each sample and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
