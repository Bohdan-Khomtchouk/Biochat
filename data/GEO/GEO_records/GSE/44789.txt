TITLE
CGH: IsoClark vs. Clark

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing in iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) tolerance were genotyped to determine differential genetic introgressions from the donor line T203 into the Clark background. The CGH comparison reveals T203 loci that are differentially introgressed between the IsoClark sub-lines.

DESIGN
Comparison of IsoClark soybean NILs to the recurrent parent Clark; the reported values show the log2 ratio of the normalized IsoClark hybridization signals (Cy3) over the normalized Clark hybridization signal (Cy5)
