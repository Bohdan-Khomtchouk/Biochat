TITLE
Bone marrow macrophage (BMMF) response to IFNgR+FcgRI coincidence detection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different cell types that make an organism use a small number of identical signaling modules to integrate external cues and elicit diverse functions.  How the specificity of functional outcomes is achieved is unclear. It must lie within the context in which the external cue is perceived and integrated by the target cell. Within the innate immune system, we discovered communication between two classes of heterologous receptors designed to integrate external cues into context-specific response. Using IFNgR as an example, we describe the structural and functional collaboration between cytokine receptors and the ITAM signaling module, in this case the Fcg-chain at the plasma membrane of phagocytes. Receptor coupling allowed IFNg to modify FcgRI responses during IgG-mediated phagocytosis and to specify cell autonomous antimicrobial functions.

DESIGN
BMMF were left unstimulated or were stimulated in duplicates for 6 hrs with IFNÎ³, IgG2a-opsonised SRBC or both. cDNA was analyzed using 8-sample Mouse Ref-8 v2.0 Illumina array.  Expressed genes were defined as those with p < 0.05, and their relative expression values were calculated using unstimulated cells as calibrator. IgG2a against SRBC was produced by hybridoma TIB111 from ATCC
