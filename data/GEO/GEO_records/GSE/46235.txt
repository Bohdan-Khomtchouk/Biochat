TITLE
Comparative expression data from HBVP (human brain vascular pericytes) and human MSC (mesenchymal stem cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pericytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are ontogenically related, and in fact no phenotypic differences were observed by flow cytometry using a panel of surface antigen markers. Global gene expression profiles of human pericytes and MSC revealed that 43 genes were expressed more than 10 fold in pericytes as compared to MSC.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in 24-w plates in complete medium for 24h in biological triplicates
