TITLE
Expression data from human CD4 or CD8 T-cells isolated from PBMC cultured at a low cell density (LDC) or high cell density (HDC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Research in human immunobiology is mainly based on working with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, recent investigations have shown that circulating CD4+ T cells are less sensitive to several T-cell activating monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and to recall antigens as compared to tissue-resident cells or cells that were in-vitro cultured at a high cell density of 10^7 cells/mL for 2 days at 37°C and 5% CO2 (RESTORE protocol, Römer et al., Blood 2011, PMID: 21931118). To explain the increase in sensitivity of CD4+ T-cells to mAbs and recall antigens on a molecular level, we performed microarray hybridizations of total RNA from T-cells isolated from PBMC that were cultured at a low or high cell density. To avoid the detection of genes that are up- or down-regulated by the culture process itself, we used low cell density cultured PBMC, instead of freshly prepared PBMC. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences in the cell density of human PBMC and identified genes that are significantly up- or downregulated dependent on the cell density of PBMC.

DESIGN
Human PBMC of one healthy blood donor were cultured at a low cell density (10^6 cells/mL) or at a high cell density (10^7 cells/mL) for 2 days at 37°C and 5% CO2 and CD4 or CD8 T-cells of both cultures were isolated by MACSbeads. Expression profiles from total RNA extracts were generated by hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
