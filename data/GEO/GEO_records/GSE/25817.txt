TITLE
Comparisons of transcriptome of Ciona intestinalis between eggs and 32-cell stage embryos to identify rapidly degrading maternal mRNA

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A genome decoded chordate Ciona intestinalis is one of the suitable animal for analyzing genetic controls in early embryogenesis and zygotically expressed genes are especially intensely studied. However maternally expressed genes are less studied than zygotic ones because of their huge numbers.  These microarray experiments were carried out to screen rapidly degrading mRNA to identify crucial maternal mRNAs for Ciona embryogenesis in relatively a short period before their degradation.

DESIGN
Two samples (unfertilized eggs vs 32-cell stage embryos), two biological replicates, dye Swap design
