SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track was produced as part of the ENCODE project. It reports the percentage of DNA molecules that exhibit cytosine methylation. In general, DNA methylation within a gene's promoter is associated with gene silencing, and DNA methylation within the exons and introns of a gene is associated with gene expression. Proper regulation of DNA methylation is essential during development and aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer. DNA methylation status was assayed with Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS). Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication, end-repaired and then ligated to methylated sequencing adapters. The library fragments were treated with sodium bisulfite and amplified by PCR to convert every unmethylated cytosine to a thymine while leaving methylated cytosines intact. The sequenced fragments were aligned to a bisulfite-converted reference genome. For each assayed cytosine, the number of sequencing reads covering that C and the percentage of those reads that were methylated were reported.
