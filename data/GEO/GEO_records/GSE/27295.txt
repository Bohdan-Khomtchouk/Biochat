TITLE
Ptf1a binding sites in a pancreatic cell line which mimics embryonic day E10.5 pancreas progenitors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic specific transcription factor1a (Ptf1a) immunoprecipitated chromatin from 266.6 cells produced 26 million tags with the Illumina high throughput sequencing technology. Many of the mapped tags were genes which were found to be differentially expressed at E10.5 in the microarray experiments comparing Ptf1a heterozygotes versus null mutant mice (study GSE26816). As Ptf1a is a bHLH transcription factor, it recognizes an E Box on the chromatin CANNTG. Since it belongs to a transcription factor complex, one of which recognizes the binding site TGGGAA,  we also found this sequence one, two or three helical turns of DNA away from the E-box where peaks were detected.

DESIGN
Ptf1a chromatin immunoprecipitation of cross-linked pancreatic cells, 266.6, to compare with the expressed genes in Ptf1a +/- vs -/- E10.5 pancreatic dorsal buds.
