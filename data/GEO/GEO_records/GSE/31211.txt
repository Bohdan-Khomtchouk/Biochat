TITLE
sRNA sequencing from wild-type Arabidopsis (diverse tissue types)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This set consists of small RNAs sequenced from wild-type Arabidopsis samples from multiple tissue types (floral, leaf, seedling, silique). Samples were prepared in two different labs and presumably under different (unknown) growth conditions, hence type A (UEA) and type B (University of Cambridge) samples.

DESIGN
4 biological replicates (7 technical replicates) of Floral A; 3 biological replicates of Floral B; 1 biological replicate of Leaf B; 2 biological replicates of Leaf A; 3 biological replicates of Seedling; 1 biological replicate of Silique. Note that GSM415783, GSM415784 and GSM415785 form part of the 'Floral A' category; GSM415783, GSM415784 are technical replicates.
