TITLE
AKT phosphorylates H3-threonine 45 to facilitate termination of gene transcription in response to DNA damage.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: In this study, we show that DNA damage-activated AKT phosphorylates threonine 45 of core histone H3 (H3-T45) Result: By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, H3-T45 phosphorylation was distributed throughout DNA damage-responsive gene loci, particularly immediately after the transcription termination site Conclusion: AKT-mediated phosphorylation of H3-T45 regulates the processing of the 3â€² end of DNA damage-activated genes to facilitate transcriptional termination

DESIGN
MCF10A cells were ChIPed with anti-phosphorylated H3-T45, anti-phosphorylated RNA Pol II-S2 and S5, and anti-H3-K36me3.
