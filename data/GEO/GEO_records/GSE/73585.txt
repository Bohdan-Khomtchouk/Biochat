TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis in  Peripheral Airway Epithelium of Distinct Lung microbiome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we assessed lower airway microbiome from a cohort of patients to determine whether specific microbiome taxa correlate with with specific metabolic activities. In a subset of 12 patients, transcriptomic expression were analyzed to compare host mucosa immune response

DESIGN
We collected peripheral airway brushings from the 12 subjects whose lung microbiome were analyzed; Total RNA were obtained from the peripheral airway epithelium.
