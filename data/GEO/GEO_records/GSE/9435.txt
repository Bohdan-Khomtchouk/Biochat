TITLE
Expression data from MDCK cells exposed to HGF +/- MAPK inhibitors

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Gene expression in Madin Darby canine kidney cells grown for 7 days to confluence on Transwell filters and exposed to HGF +/- inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (MAPK is one of the pathways activated when HGF binds to the CMET receptor tyrosine kinase). We used microarrays to detail the program of gene expression in MDCK cells and identified genes specifically regulated by HGF via the MAPK pathway. Keywords: signaling pathway analysis
