TITLE
Gene expression response of Medicago truncatula roots treated with Nod-LCOs

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Legumes interact with rhizobia, leading to the development of root nodules. Diffusible rhizobial signals were identified as Nod-LCOs. Applying Nod-LCOs on plantlet roots, we used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to the external application of Nod-LCOs.
