TITLE
Gene expression of MLL/AF9 leukemia cells sorted from mice treated with or without brequinar

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice bearing an MLL/AF9 leukemia were treated with vehicle or brequinar every three days for a total of four doses. Mice were euthanized for collection of the bone marrow cells. The leukemia cells were purified by FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) and total RNA was prepared from the purified leukemia cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed in singlicate by RNA-sequencing.
