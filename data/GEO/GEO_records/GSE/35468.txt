TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of epidermal differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to establish a deeply sequenced transcriptome at multiple timepoints during the differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes from the progenitor state (d0).  These transcriptomes were then assembled in order to discover novel genes and transcriptional events that are dynamically regulated during terminal differentiation of a human somatic tissue.

DESIGN
Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on primary human keratinocytes at three timepoints during calcium-induced epidermal differentiation.
