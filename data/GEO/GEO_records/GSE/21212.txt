TITLE
Expression profiling of Endothelial (EC) and Non-endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of HUVEC (human umbilical vein EC cell; Lonza), HAEC (human aortic EC cells), HCAEC (human coronary artery EC cells), HPAEC (human pulmonary artery EC cells), HMVEC (human microvascular (dermal) , HASMC ( Human Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells), T cells and Bcells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Endothelial cells and Non-endothelial cells in order to identify the genes with preferntial expression to endothelial cells.  The experiments are performed in duplicate on both the HT Human Genome U133A and U133B arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL3921 [HT_HG-U133A] Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133A Array GPL9197 [HT_HG-U133B] Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133B Array
