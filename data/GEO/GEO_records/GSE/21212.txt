TITLE
Expression profiling of Endothelial (EC) and Non-endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of HUVEC (human umbilical vein EC cell; Lonza), HAEC (human aortic EC cells), HCAEC (human coronary artery EC cells), HPAEC (human pulmonary artery EC cells), HMVEC (human microvascular (dermal) , HASMC ( Human Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells), T cells and Bcells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Endothelial cells and Non-endothelial cells in order to identify the genes with preferntial expression to endothelial cells.  The experiments are performed in duplicate on both the HT Human Genome U133A and U133B arrays.
