TITLE
Time Course of Adults Vaccinated with Influenza TIV Vaccine during 2011/12 Flu Season

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systems approaches have been used to describe molecular signatures driving immunity to influenza vaccination in humans. Whether such signatures are similar across multiple seasons, and in diverse populations is unknown. We applied systems approaches to study immune responses in young and, elderly subjects vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine across 5 consecutive seasons.

DESIGN
During the 2011 Influenza season, healthy adults were vaccinated with TIV, and blood samples isolated at days 0, 3, 7 post-vaccination. Microarrays were performed using total RNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of vaccinees.
