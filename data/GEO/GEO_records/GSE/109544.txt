TITLE
Differential gene expression pattern of mouse livers transfected with dual oncogenes (day-7 post-injection data set)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand global gene expression patterns of mouse livers upon dual-oncogene transfection, RNA sequencing and analysis were conducted on liver samples from Shp2F/F or Shp2∆H (Shp2F/F:Alb-cre) mice hydrodynamically injected with the combination of Met/β-Catenin or Met/PIK3CA .

DESIGN
18 mice from 6 experimental groups (n=3 for each group) were included in the experiment. Group1: GFP hydrodynamically injected Shp2F/F control mice; Group2: GFP hydrodynamically injected Shp2ΔH control mice; Group3: Met/β-Catenin hydrodynamically injected Shp2F/F mice;  Group4: Met/β-Catenin hydrodynamically injected Shp2ΔH mice; Group5: Met/PIK3CA hydrodynamically injected Shp2F/F mice; Group6: Met/PIK3CA hydrodynamically injected Shp2ΔH mice. Total RNA was extracted on day-7 post-injection from liver of each mouse.
