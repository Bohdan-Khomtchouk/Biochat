TITLE
Gene expression profile of fresh human acute myeloid leukemia cells exposed ex vivo to AS602868

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study modifications in gene expression profiles induced by the cytotoxic compound AS602868, we employed genome microarray expression profiling on treated and untreated samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated leukemic blasts from AML patients were incubated for 6 hours with 10 ÂµM AS602868. As AS602868 was initially diluted in DMSO, untreated samples were exposed to equivalent volume of DMSO for 6 hours.
