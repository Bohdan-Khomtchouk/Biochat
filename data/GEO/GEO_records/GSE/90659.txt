TITLE
Genetic analysis of Ikaros target genes and tumor suppressor function in BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed in human Ph+ pre-B ALL cells that harbor a deletion of the Ikaros DNA binding domain (Ik6) after doxycycline induction of exogenous expression of wild-type Ikaros (Ik1) or control empty vector over 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Biological replicates (n=2) using independent cultures and inductions were performed.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq from human BCR-ABL+ pre-B ALL xenograft cell-line PDX2 following 24 h of DOX induction of IK1 or empty vector controls
