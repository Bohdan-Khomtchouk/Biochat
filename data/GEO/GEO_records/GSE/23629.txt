TITLE
Expression data from RCC paired tumors to study metastasis progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigates the molecular signatures that drive Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) metastatic conversion using the 16 paired Human tumor samples. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
To identify differences in gene expression associated with increasing metastatic activity, we subjected 16 paired human tumor samples to gene expression profiling.
