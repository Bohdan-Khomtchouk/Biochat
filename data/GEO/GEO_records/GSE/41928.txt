Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in response to bortezomib treatment [mouse cell lines II]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in response to bortezomib treatment(33 nM) in cell lines before and after selection for resistance. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow. While the first-to-market proteasome inhibitor bortezomib/VELCADE has been successfully used to treat myeloma patients, drug resistance remains an emerging problem. In this study, we identify signatures of bortezomib sensitivity and resistance by gene expression profiling (GEP) using pairs of bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines created from the Bcl-XL/Myc double transgenic mouse model of MM. Finally, these data reveal complex heterogeneity within MM and suggest resistance to one drug class reprograms resistant clones to make them more sensitive to a distinct class of drugs. This study represents an important next step in translating pharmacogenomic profiling and may be useful for understanding personalized pharmacotherapy of MM patients.
