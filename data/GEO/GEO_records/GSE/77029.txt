TITLE
Distinct myeloid progenitor differentiation pathways uncovered through single cell RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question.    We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a seperation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

DESIGN
Find unbiased heterogeneity in the preGM hematopoietic progenitor population
