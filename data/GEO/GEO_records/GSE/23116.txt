TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in ATM-deficient MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of interferon-related genes was more enhanced in irradiated ATM-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than in irradiated ATM wild-type MEFs.

DESIGN
Nonirradiated-ATM-WT vs Irradiated-ATM-WT vs  Nonirradaited-ATM-KO vs IrradiatedATM-KO
