TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in ATM-deficient MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of interferon-related genes was more enhanced in irradiated ATM-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than in irradiated ATM wild-type MEFs.

DESIGN
Nonirradiated-ATM-WT vs Irradiated-ATM-WT vs  Nonirradaited-ATM-KO vs IrradiatedATM-KO

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
