TITLE
Cyanothece 51142 grown under high CO2 conditions: 0.03% CO2 vs. 8% CO2

ORGANISM
Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142

SUMMARY
Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photoautotrophs notable for their ability to utilize atmospheric CO2 as the major source of carbon. The prospect of using cyanobacteria in converting solar energy and high concentrations of CO2 (e.g. flue gas from coal power plants) efficiently into biomass and renewable energy sources is of interest to many research fields. In order to guide further advances in this area, a better understanding about the metabolic changes that occur under conditions of high CO2 is important. The objective of this study is to utilize genome-wide microarray expression profiling in the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece 51142 grown in 8% CO2-enriched air and to determined the impact of high CO2 on cyanobacterial cell physiology and growth.

DESIGN
Study of metabolic and cellular adaptations to high CO2 conditions in the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece 51142. Two-condition experiment: 0.03% CO2 vs. 8% CO2. Biological replicates: 2; technical replicates: 3; Spots/ORF: 3 per Chip. Samples were collected at 7 time points over a period of two days, namely, Day1_30minLight (30min), Day1_2hrsLight (2hr), Day1_6hrsLight (6hr), Day1_1hrsDark (13hr), Day1-6hrsDark (18hr), Day2_6hrsLight (30hr) and Day2_6hrsDark (42hr).
