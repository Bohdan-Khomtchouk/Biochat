TITLE
Analysis of gene expression levels between CCl4 induced mouse fibrotic liver tissues and vehicle treated mouse control liver tissues.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the altered gene expression levels in mouse fibrotic liver tissues, C57BL6/J mice were intraperitoneally injected with CCl4 or vehicle twice every week. After 8 weeks, livers were harvested and RNA was extracted by Trizol. The gene expression levels were analyzed and compared between CCl4 treated group and vehicle treated (control) group.

DESIGN
Three CCl4 induced mouse fibrotic liver tissues, three vehicle treated mouse control liver tissues.
