TITLE
Murine KN6-Lig+ and Lig- DN4 Cells compared to DN3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of  KN6 DN4 TCR Tg thymocytes adopting the γδ fate (Lig+) or the  αβ fate (Lig-)

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Lig+ vs. KN6-DN3 and Lig- vs. KN6-DN3 cells. Biological replicates: 4 Lig+ (one dye-swap), 3 Lig- (one dye-swap).

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
