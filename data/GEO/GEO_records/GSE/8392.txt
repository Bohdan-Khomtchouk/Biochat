TITLE
Genome-Wide Expression Profiling of the Arabidopsis Female Gametophyte Identifies Families of Small, Secreted Proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression in wild type ovules to that in dif1 mutant (no embro sac) and myb98 mutant (impaired pollen tube guidance) Keywords: gene expression analysis

DESIGN
12 samples were analyzed, with replicates per genotpye (wild type, dif1, myb98).  Ovules were dissected out of muture ovaries.  Total RNA was isloated by spin column purification, 2 ug were  used as template for reverse transcription, seceond strand synthesis and biotin labeling.
