TITLE
RNA sequencing of brown adipose tissue of lean and obese mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report differential expressed genes in brown adipose tissue of mice fed with a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet.

DESIGN
Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice at age of 6 weeks - 10 weeks fed either a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet.  mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicates, using Illumina NextSeq500 sequencing system.  The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the gene level with DESeq2.
