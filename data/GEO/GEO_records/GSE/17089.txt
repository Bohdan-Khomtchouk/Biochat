TITLE
Identification of direct transcriptional targets of V600EBRAF/MEK in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A375P melanoma cells were treated with 1uM of the MEK inhibitor PD184352 or 0.4uM of the V600EBRAF inhibitor PLX4720 for 2hr, 6hr and 24hrs. DMSO treatment for 2hr, 6hr and 24hrs serves as the negative control

DESIGN
Triplicate experiments were performed for DMSO, PD184352 and PLX4720 treatment at 3 timepoints - 2, 6, 24hrs.

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
