TITLE
Gene expression profile at liver tissue of White Leghorn and four Korean native chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To characterize breed-specific difference among four Korean native chicken breeds and White Leghorn, we measured their transcriptomes at liver tissue using Affymetrix Chicken gene 1.0 ST array platform.

DESIGN
To characterize breed-specific gene expression, we measured global gene expression profiles at liver tissue of male control breed (White Leghorn, WL) and four different male korean native chicken breeds including Yeonsan Ogye (Og), Hyunin Black (Bl), Hwangbong (Hw) and Hoengseong Yakdak (Ya) (n=3 in each breed).
