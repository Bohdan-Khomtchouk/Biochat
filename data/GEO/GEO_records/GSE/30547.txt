TITLE
Expression data from the Arabidopsis root epidermis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The root epidermis of Arabidopsis provides a simple and experimentally useful model for studying the molecular basis of cell fate and differentiation.   The goal of this study was to define the larger gene regulatory network that governs the differentiation of the root hair and non-hair cell types of the Arabidopsis root epidermis.   Transcript levels in the root epidermis of wild-type and mutant lines were assessed by purifying populations of root epidermal cells using fluorescence-based cell-sorting.  Further, the role of the plant hormones auxin and ethylene on root epidermis development was assessed by defining transcript levels in the root epidermis of plants grown on media containing IAA or ACC.  These microarray results were used to construct a comprehensive gene regulatory network that depicts the transcriptional control of root epidermal cell fate and differentiation in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
The cells of the developing root epidermis were obtained by growing plant seedlings expressing the WER::GFP transgene under sterile conditions on MS media, cutting off root tips (including all developmental stages), protoplasting the roots, and purifying cells containing GFP using FACS.   The WER::GFP transgene is expressed throughout the developing cells of the root epidermis and the lateral root cap.   Three biological replicates were analyzed for each of the 25 plant lines examined in this study.
