TITLE
Expression data of 3 colorectal carcinoma cell lines with or without exposure to radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) associated with radiosensitivity in colorectal carcinoma cell lines, expression profiles of Lovo, RKO and SW480 cell lines with different levels of radiosensitivity were investigated on ArrayStar platform. A probe-remapping strategy was applied to aquire the accurate probe annotation. By comparing expression profiles of cells with exposure to radiation with those of control sample (cells without exposure), a list of lncRNAs associated with radiation response was compiled. GSEA was then performed to explore their biological functions.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA collected from three cell lines (Lovo, RKO and SW480) with or without exposure to 2Gy dose of radiation.
