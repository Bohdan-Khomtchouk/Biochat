TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD4+myelin basic protein specific T cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
CNS autoimmunity is induced by autoreactive  T cells reactive against CNS antigen. However how these T cells become able to transgress the blood brain barrier is not CNS autoimmunity is induced by autoreactive  T cells reactive against CNS antigen. Here a gene expression profile of the pathogenic T cells in different functional states was performed. These studies were performed in a classical model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats induced by transfer of CD4+myelin basic protein specific T cells. We found that on their way to the CNS T cells fundamentally reprogram their gene expression profile, by down-regulating their activation program and up-regulating cell locomotion molecules.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from ex vitro myelin specific T cells (blasts and resting state, day 2 and 7 after antigen challenge respectively) or isolated from the spleen (3 days p.t.) was used to perform a genome-wide transcriptional profiling assay (Rat Genome 230, Affymetrix)-
