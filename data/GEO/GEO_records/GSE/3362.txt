TITLE
Genes involved in doxorubicin drug resistance in 143b osteosarcoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was done to identify the differentially expressed genes in response to Doxorubicin drug resistance in the 143B human osteosarcoma cell line, using the Microarray technology. Keywords: drug resistance; dual channel; cell line based; doxorubicin resistance; Human osteosarcoma cell line

DESIGN
A two-dye experiment model, using the wild type 143B osteosarcoma cell line (Control) and the 143B Doxorubicin drug resistant cell line (Test), was done. Using the GPL2869 Platform (70-mer oligo based array), 4 experiments were done, two were regular (GSM76017 and GSM76020) (Wild type = Cy3; drug resistant = Cy5) and two were dye swap (GSM76018 and GSM76019).

PLATFORM
GPL2869 UC Human 22K v2.2 Operon 70-mer oligo array
