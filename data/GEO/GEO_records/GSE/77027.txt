TITLE
Genome-wide identification of snoRNA-guided 2â€™-O-methylation sites [CLIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We combine two experimental high-throughput sequencing methods to identify new 2'-O-methylation sites in human and assign snoRNA guides to sites with previously unknown guides.

DESIGN
CLIP-Seq profiling for snoRNP core protein Fibrillarin in HEK293 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
