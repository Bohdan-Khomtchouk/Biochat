TITLE
Gene expression profiling in LoVo-P compared with LoVo-C cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The differential expression of mRNA in LoVo-P cells compared with LoVo-C cells was successfully detected using the Arraystar Human LncRNA/mRNAArray V4.0, that used for the global profiling of 20730 human mRNA and 40173 long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) transcripts.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, colorectal cancer cell line LoVo expressed low levels of PRL-3, and we selected LoVo cells for constructing PRL-3 overexpression lines. The stable transfection of pAcGFP-PRL-3 (LoVo-P) and pAcGFP (LoVo-C) vectors was achieved, resulting in the over expression of PRL-3 and control vector. LoVo-P and LoVo-C cells was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 20730 human mRNA and 40173 long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) transcripts
