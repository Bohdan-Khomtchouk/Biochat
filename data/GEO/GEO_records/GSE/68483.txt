TITLE
Engineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum for growth and succinate production from levoglucosan as a pyrolytic sugar substrate

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
We deveolped the C. glutamicum strains that is able to utilize levoglucoan as sole carbon and produce succinate. To understand the cellular metabolism in a levoglucosan-utilizing strain, we compared the mRNA profiling of a levoglucosan-utilizing strains grown in either glucose or levoglucosan.

DESIGN
Comparision of the transcriptome from a levoglucosan-utilizing strain & succinate-producing strain (BL-1-LGK) grown in either glucose (as a control) or levoglucosan (as an experiment) at 5 h
