TITLE
Trichostatin A does not correct specific errors of somatic cell nuclear transfer on the transcriptomic level; highlighing the non-random nature of oocyte-mediated reprogramming errors.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Bovine cloned and IVF blastocysts at day 7  were collected and used for comparative transcriptomics.

DESIGN
A potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), was used to understand the effect of assisted epigenetic modification on the transcriptional profile of SCNT blastocysts and to identify specific genes or categories of genes affected in the developing embryos.
