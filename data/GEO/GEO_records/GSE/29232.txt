TITLE
Identification of androgen-regulated genes in RWPE-1-AR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of RWPE-1 cells stably expressing human androgen receptor (as described in Altintas et al., Mol Cell Endocrinol 2011) treated with a non-metabolisable androgen, R1881

DESIGN
RWPE-1-AR cells were treated with R1881 during 3h or 24h and compared to control not treated cells. Three independent cell culture experiments for each treatment condition (vehicle or R1881 for 3h and 24h).
