TITLE
TRIM28 regulates RNA polymerase II promoter proximal pausing and entry into processive elongation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of total PolII and Ser2-phosphorylated PolII genomic occupancy in control-transfected (WT) or Trim28-knockdown (Trim28-KD) embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cells were transfected with luciferase siRNA (WT) or Trim28 siRNA (Trim28 KD) in duplicate experiments. 48 hrs after transfection, cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde, collected, lysed, and chromatin was fragmented with sonication. Total PolII or Ser2-phosphorylated PolII genomic occupancy in WT or Trim28 KD cells were determined by ChIP-seq.
