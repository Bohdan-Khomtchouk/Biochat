TITLE
Extensive genetic diversity and substructuring among zebrafish strains revealed through copy number variant analysis (CGH)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Copy number variants (CNVs) represent a substantial source of genomic variation in vertebrates, but the zebrafish reference genome has no annotated CNV information.  We further analyzed zebrafish CNVs using pooled samples of 10 zebrafish each from three laboratory strains (AB, Tubingen, and WIK) to identify strain specific CNVs between groups.â€ƒ

DESIGN
10 zebrafish from 3 laboratory strains were pooled and run against the other pooled samples resulting in three array combinations.
