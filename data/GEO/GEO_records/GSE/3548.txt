TITLE
Gene expression alteration in human fibroblast cells after folate depletion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular basis linking folate deficiency to certain health conditions and developmental defects is complex and not fully understood.  In this study, we examined the consequences of folate deficiency on global gene expression by microarray analysis and compared transcript levels in normal human fibroblast cells (GM03349) grown in folate deficient and sufficient medium. Keywords: folate depletion, stress response, comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Two biological replicates are analyzed, each in quadruplicate with dye-swaps.
