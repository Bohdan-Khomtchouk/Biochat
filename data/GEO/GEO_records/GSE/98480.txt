TITLE
Gene expression profile of human antigen presenting cells with a tolerogenic phenotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immature dendritic cells (DCs) that are incubated with TLR-ligands during in vitro differentiation develop a tolerogenic phenotype. Especially an early encounter of isolated monocytes with the Toll-like receptor 7/8 ligand R848 mediates a switch of pro-inflammatory to immunosupressive properties. We were strongly interested in the identification of factors that are involved in the differentiation of these tolerogenic cells, thus we performed gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from antigen presenting cells (APCs) treated with different TLR-ligands, namely LPS, R848 and PIC, during differentiation. Immature dendritic cells were adducted as comparison.
