TITLE
Transcriptomic changes in response to different carbon sources in Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Purpose: We explore gene expression changes when Neurospora crassa wild type responds to different carbon sources in Vogel's medium. Method: We obtained mRNA samples of Neurospora crassa WT in Vogel's minimal medium (VMM) with different carbon source and used RNA-seq technique to measure the trancriptome changes. Results: We identified many genes of transcription factors and enzymes that were up regulated or down regulated in response to the different carbon stimulation. Conclusion: Our data represents a systematic transcriptome profiling of filamentous fungi on different carbon source and identify COL-26 as a critical regulator in degradation of starch components.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of cultures of WT after 4 hours of exposure to media of interest were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000. Soluble carbon sources are 2 mM and insoluble carbon source are 2% (w/v).
