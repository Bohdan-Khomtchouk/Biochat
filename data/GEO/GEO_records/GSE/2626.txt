TITLE
Intestine mRNA tagging

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
mRNA tagging in the intestine of C. elegans.  FLAG::PAB-1 was expressed from the intestine-specific promoter for ges-1 and used to immunoprecipitate FLAG::PAB-1/mRNA complexes from the intestine with anti-FLAG antibody on agarose beads.  This mRNA was amplified, cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy5.  Total RNA from the same strain, but without the IP was amplified and cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy3.  These two samples were compared on C. elegans DNA printed arrays from the Stuart Kim lab.  1938 intestine-expressed genes were identified (p < 0.001) after eight repeats of the experiment A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments.
