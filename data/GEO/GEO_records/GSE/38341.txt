TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of lung cancer cells over-expression miR-34a.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Zeb1 transcriptional repressor plays a key role in metastasis through the down-regulation of genes that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem-ness. Here we report that Zeb1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor suppressive microRNAs (miRs). Zeb1 stimulated pro-migratory cytoskeletal processes by down-regulating miR-34a and activated Rho GTPases through Arhgap1, a Cdc42 GTPase activating protein and novel miR-34a target gene. Poor-prognosis human lung adenocarcinomas were highly enriched in a cytoskeletal gene signature activated by miR-34a down-regulation. These findings suggest that Zeb1 regulates a miR network and drives pro-migratory cytoskeletal processes through miR-34a.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from primary tumors from mice injected with 344SQ-vector and -miR-34a cells, and then hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Determination of differentially expressed genes was carried out.
