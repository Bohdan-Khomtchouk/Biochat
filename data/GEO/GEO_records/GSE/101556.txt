TITLE
Genomic binding profiling upon expression of Ubx in S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sought to determine the genomic binding profile of the Drosophila Hox protein Ubx in a homogenous cell system. S2-DRSC cells that have no Hox expression were stably transfected with HA-tagged Ubx under the control of a metallothionein promoter. Upon Ubx expression, we identified high enrichment of Ubx at a large number transcription start sites that colocalises with the GAGA and M1BP.

DESIGN
S2-DRSC cells are stably transfected with HA-tagged Ubx (S2-DRSC:Ubx).S2-Ubx cells are analysed for genomic binding of HA-Ubx
