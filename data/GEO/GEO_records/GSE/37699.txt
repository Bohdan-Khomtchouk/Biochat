TITLE
Aberrant ERK signaling causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clinical efficacy of EGFR kinase inhibitors is limited by the development of drug resistance. The irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor WZ4002 is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation. Here we show that in multiple complementary models harboring EGFR T790M, resistance to WZ4002 develops through aberrant activation of ERK signaling caused by either an amplification of MAPK1 or by downregulation of negative regulators of ERK signaling. Inhibition of MEK or ERK restores sensitivity to WZ4002, and the combination of WZ4002 and a MEK inhibitor prevents the emergence of drug resistance. The WZ4002 resistant MAPK1 amplified cells also demonstrate an increase both in EGFR internalization and a decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy compared to the parental counterparts. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors and highlight rational combination therapies that should be evaluated in clinical trials. Our study identifies ERK signaling as a mediator of resistance to irreversible pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors in EGFR T790M-bearing cancers. We further provide a therapeutic strategy to both treat and prevent the emergence of this resistance mechanism.

DESIGN
To generate drug-resistant NCI-H1975 cell lines, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of WZ4002 similar to previously described methods. Individual clones from WZ4002-resistant (WZR) cells were isolated and confirmed to be drug resistant. Clone #6, designated as WZR6, was used in this study. For expression analysis, samples were prepared in triplicate from parental NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1975 WZR6 cells.
