TITLE
Genome-wide localization of Trf2 and TBP in Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we use ChIP-seq in Drosophila embryos to determine the genome-wide binding pattern of TBP and Trf2 using two different antibodies for each factor.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq using anti-Trf2 and anti-TBP antibodies in Drosophila embryos

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
