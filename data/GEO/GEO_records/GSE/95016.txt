TITLE
Deletion of the thyroid hormone-activating type 2 deiodinase rescues cone photoreceptor degeneration but not deafness in mice lacking type 3 deiodinase

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to get the retinal transcriptome profiles (RNA-seq) for understanding gene regulations during retina development

DESIGN
Retinal mRNA profiles from embryo day 16.5 to postnatal day 28 wild type (WT) mice were generated by NGS sequencing
