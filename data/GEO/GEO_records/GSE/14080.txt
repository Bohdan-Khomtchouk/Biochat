TITLE
GRO analysis of rap1-sil, tpk1 & tpk2.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
GRO (Genomic run-on) experiments with different mutants that affect to the accumulation of non active RNA pol II along the yeast genome. Keywords: Genomic run-on GRO

DESIGN
There are 4 different strains: rap1-sil (without the silencing domain), RAP1(both from Graham I.R. et al 1999) and tpk1 & tpk2 mutants (Euroscarf). For each experiment there are GRO data (Transcription Rate) and gDNA data used for normalizing the GRO signals. The last number of the GRO filters correspond to the number of gDNA filters.There are 3 independent biological replicates of Rap1 and rap1-sil experiments and 2 for the tpk1 & tpk2 experiments.
