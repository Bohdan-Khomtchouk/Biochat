TITLE
Expression data from mouse small intestinal γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors thousands of bacterial species that include symbionts as well as potential pathogens. The immune responses that limit access of these bacteria to underlying tissue remain poorly defined. In this study, we used microarrays to uncover the transcriptional responses that occur in small intestinal γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes following bacterial challenge.
