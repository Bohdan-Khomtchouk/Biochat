TITLE
The splicing regulator Rbfox1 (A2BP1) controls neuronal excitation in the mammalian brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression and alternative splicing data from 1-month-old Rbfox1 KO brain. Rbfox1 regulates the alternative splicing of many transcripts in neurons. We have characterized the Rbfox1-dependent changes in expression and alternative splicing by comparing Rbfox1-KO brain to WT brain. In this dataset, we include the splicing and expression data obtained from dissected WT and Rbfox1 KO mouse brains.
