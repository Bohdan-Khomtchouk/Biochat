TITLE
Knock down effect of Ror2 on gene expression profiling in human osteosarcoma cells (SaOS2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ror2 is a member of the Ror-family of receptor tyrosine kinases acting as a receptor for Wnt5a. Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling activates primarily the ß-catenin-independent pathway, which involves various signal mediators, such as Dishevelled, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), filamin A, c-Src, and Ca2+. Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling has also been shown to inhibit the ß-catenin-dependent pathway. Wnt5a and Ror2 are overexpressed in various types of tumor cells, including osteosarcoma and melanoma cells, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. Constitutively activated Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling has been shown to play important roles in promoting invadopodia formation and invasiveness of tumor cells. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these processes. As an attempt to understand the mechanism by which Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling, activated constitutively in osteosarcoma cells, contributes to their highly invasive properties, we performed DNA microarray analysis using a human osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS2.

DESIGN
Human osteosarcoma cells (SaOS2) have been transfected with control (siCTL) or ROR2 (siROR2)-directed siRNA. Two biological replicate were used for the comparison of siCTL v.s. siROR2.
