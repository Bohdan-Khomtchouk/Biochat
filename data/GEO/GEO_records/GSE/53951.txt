TITLE
Gene expression after type-I interferon treatment in primary neurons, primary fibroblasts and L929 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray expression profilling of mouse primary mixed cortical/hippocampal neurons, primary fibroblasts and L929 cells to compare ISGs signature in disctinct cell types

DESIGN
Primary mixed cortical/hippocampal neurons, primary fibroblasts (MEFs) and L929 cells were mock-treated or treated with 5U/mL of IFN-beta and RNA was harvested after 24 hours. For neurons and fibroblast, 2 samples were analyzed for each condition.
