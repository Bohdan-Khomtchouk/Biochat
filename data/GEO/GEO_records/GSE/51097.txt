TITLE
Effects of MBD3 depletion on nucleosome occupancy in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have identified that MBD3/NuRD localizes at active promoters and enhancers, suggesting an active role of NuRD at open chromatin region. Because NuRD includes nucleosome remodelers, CHD3 and CHD4, we hypothesized that NuRD regulates nucleosome organization at open chromatin region. To test this idea, we performed micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by massively parallel sequencing (MNase-seq) in MBD3 knockdowned MCF-7 cells. We observed the decrease of nucleosome occupancy at promoters and enhancers in MBD3 knockdowned cells. Our results suggest a regulatory role of MBD3/NuRD at open chromatin region.

DESIGN
Mapped nucleosome positioning in control (shLuc) and MBD3 knockdowned MCF-7 cells, in duplicate.
