TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolases, AtNUDX6 and 7, exhibit pyrophosphohydrolase activities toward NADH and contribute to the modulation of various defense responses, such as the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) reaction and salicylic acid (SA)-induced Nonexpresser of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1 (NPR1)-dependent defense pathway, against biotic and abiotic stresses. To identify genes (NRGs) whose expression levels positively and negatively correlated with NADH levels, a transcriptome analysis using KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants, in which intracellular NADH levels increased in a step-wise manner.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants were grown on MS medium in a growth chamber kept at 23°C during 16 h of light (100 µmol/m2/s) and at 22°C during 8 h of darkness. Two-week-old cotyledons were collected as samples for microarray analysis.
