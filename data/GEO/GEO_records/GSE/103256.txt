TITLE
Expression data of A549 cells treated with 2 µM of HCI-2509 for 48 h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inhibition of LSD1 is a novel option for treatment of lung  cancer. Using HCI-2509, a specific inhibitor of LSD1, results in a cell cycle arrest as wel as a shift in global histone 3 lysine 4 and lysine 9 dimethylation pattern. Using microarrays we aim to illucidate the changed transcriptome upon treatement of HCI-2509 in lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with either DMSO as control or 2 µM HCI-2509 for 48 h. RNA was exctraced using the automated isolation kit AS-1280 (Promega) in the Maxwell-16 (Promega) with subsequent microarray hybridization.
