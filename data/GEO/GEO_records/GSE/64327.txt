TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of chromatin occupancy of GATA1 and its short isoform GATA1s (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-Seq data for GATA1 and the leukemia-associated short isoform GATA1s in G1ME cells, a Gata1-null cell line with both erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation potential.  We introduced HA-tagged GATA1 or GATA1s into G1ME cells via retroviral transduction.  The cells were crosslinked at 48h post-transduction, and an HA antibody was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).  ChIP and input samples were sequenced on Illumina GAII or GAIIx high-throughput sequencers.  The data reveal a deficiency of chromatin occupancy by GATA1s, especially at genes involved in erythrocyte differentiation and function.

DESIGN
Examinaton of chromatin occupancy of GATA1 and GATA1s  in G1ME cells cultured in TPO.

PLATFORM
