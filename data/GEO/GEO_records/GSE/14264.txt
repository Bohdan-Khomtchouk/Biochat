TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of the transcriptional program of Myc-dependent transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled Myc binding in a normal breast cell-line (MCF10A) under basal conditions after ectopic expression of Myc. We showed that ectopic Myc expression increases tumour formation in vivo and in vitro. We then profiled genome-wide Myc binding using Agilent promoter arrays in MCF10A cells expressing wild-type and ectopic Myc. We show that Myc binds to a greater number of spots in wild-type than in Myc cells, but that some targets are unique to each condition. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
