TITLE
Gene expression profiling in LSD1 depleted Huh-1 cell line under hypoxic condition.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role for LSD1 under hypoxia condition. we depleted LSD1 gene with siRNA in Huh-1 cell lines under 1% O2 hypoxia condtion, and than perforemed gene expression microarray analysis. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), determined to identify the biological pathway.

DESIGN
Determined the gene expression profile of the LSD konckdown effect under hypoxia condition. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) decided to identify the biological pathways.

PLATFORM
