TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line IMR5-75 upon inducible MYCN-knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inducible MYCN-knockdown, followed by RNA-seq analysis in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line IMR5-75, reveals profound time-dependent transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
For modulation of MYCN levels, stable neuroblastoma cell models were used where MYCN can be  downregulated via vector-based hairpin RNA induction upon addition of 1Âµg/ml tetracycline (IMR5-75-shMYCN. From cells treated either with tetracycline or solvent (ethanol), RNA was isolated at time points 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours. Experiments were done in duplicates. RNA was sequenced.
