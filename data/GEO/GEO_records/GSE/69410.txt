TITLE
Myc-driven medulloblastoma cells treated with Panobinostat (LBH589)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse MycT58A/DNp53 (MP) medulloblastoma cells were treated with DMSO or HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat for 6 or 12 hours in vitro. Gene expression profiling was performed to compare cells treated with panobinostat and DMSO.

DESIGN
Using the mouse model for MYC-driven Group 3 medulloblastoma, we tried to understand the mechanism of HDACi-induced cytotoxicity by comparing the gene expression profiles of cells treated with panobinostat (LBH-589) to cells treated with DMSO control.
