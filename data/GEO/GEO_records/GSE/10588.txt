TITLE
Placental gene expression in severe preeclampsia.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The series is composed of thirty hybridizations for analysis of differentially expressed genes in normal placenta tissues from patients with normal labor and placenta tissues from patients with severe preeclampsia. Patients tissues samples were obtained from (Vasilis. Total RNA extraction was performed by using the MagNa Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). Keywords: Gene expression study, Disease state

DESIGN
Twenty-six out of 50 normal placentas were randomly selected to match with 17 preeclamptic placentas, accounting for parity. Microarrays were performed applying a direct comparison design.
