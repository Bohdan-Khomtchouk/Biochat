TITLE
Comparison of Differences in Gene Expression in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell of 5 Pairs of Rat Lines Selectively Bred for High or Low Alcohol Consumption

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine common innate differences in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens shell among the selectively bred (a) alcohol-preferring (P) vs. alcohol-non-preferring (NP) rats: (b) high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) vs. low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) rats (both replicates); (c) ALKO alcohol (AA) vs. nonalcohol (ANA) rats; and (d) Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) vs. alcohol-nonpreferring (sNP) rats.

DESIGN
Comparison of Differences in Gene Expression in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell of 5 Pairs of Rat Lines Selectively Bred for High or Low Alcohol Consumption.
