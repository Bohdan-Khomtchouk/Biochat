TITLE
Niche-dependent expression profiles of intratumoral heterogenous ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exploring the expression profile of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cancer cell subpopulations- derived tumors grown within a murine and a human cellular tissues.

DESIGN
RNA samples were obtained from laser micro-dissected from two cancer cell subpopulations (CCSPs C12 and C13)- derived tumors that developed within a murine (intratumoral) and a human (intra-teratoma) and from  in vitro grown cells;  a total of 9 RNA samples of CCSP's C12 and 9 RNA samples of CCSP's C13 .
