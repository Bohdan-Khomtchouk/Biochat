TITLE
Differential expression between Sh2b3 knockout and wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To validate the predicted Sh2b3 derived gene regulatory subnetwork using integrative network approach  in human population study, we examined the gene expression levels of whole blood in WT (wild-type) and Sh2b3-/- mice by RNA sequencing, and identified the differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing whole blood samples from 4 WT and 4 Sh2b3-/- mice.

PLATFORM
