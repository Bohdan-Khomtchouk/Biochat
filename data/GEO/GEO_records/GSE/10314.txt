SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms involved in host pathogen interactions at mucosal surfaces needs to be better understood in order to develop immune-mediated methods of protection against pathogens. Cholera toxin (CT) has the rare ability for a protein of inducing robust mucosal immunity in the gut and is therefore an excellent model with which to determine mechanisms of adjuvanticity and immunogenicity at intestinal mucosal surfaces. Jejunal epithelial cells are one of the first sites of antigen encounter. Therefore a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2, was cultured in 6-well transwell plates in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml cholera toxin for up to 8 hours and the cell layer was harvested for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix porcine genome array and real-time PCR analysis. Affymetrix analysis identified, and real-time PCR analysis of 15 genes confirmed, an increase in gene expression for 59 genes and a decrease in gene expression for 14 genes under CT treatment. An 8 hour time course of expression revealed that by 2-4 hours after CT treatment, all 10 upregulated genes were differentially expressed and by 4-6 hours after CT treatment 3 of the 5 downregulated genes were differentially expressed. These data suggest that the potent mucosal adjuvanticity and immunogenicity of CT derives from rapid alterations in gene expression at the site of first antigen encounter with the immune system. Characterization of early immune gene expression may elucidate potential biological mechanisms for mucosal immune induction leading to the development of effective vaccines against enteric pathogens.
