TITLE
Genome-wide binding of SET, SETα and SETβ isoforms in ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified the genome wide binding sites of SET isoforms by ChIP-Seq

DESIGN
Examination of SET binding sites in the mouse ESC genome and genome-wide localization of histone H1 in mouse ESCs by ChIP-Seq.
