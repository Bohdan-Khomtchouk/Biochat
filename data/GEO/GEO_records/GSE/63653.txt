TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify factors that could explain why mice transplanted with Vim deficient  bone marrow display decreased atherosclerosis despite increased inflammation, we performed global gene expression profiling of bone-marrow derived macrophages from vimentin-deficient or wild-type littermates on C57BL/6 background.

DESIGN
We elucidated the role of vimentin in atherogenic low-density receptorâ€“ deficient mice after bone marrow transplantation from vimentin-deficient mice.
