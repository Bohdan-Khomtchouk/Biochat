TITLE
Identification of axonal regeneration-associated genes after spinal cord injury in adult zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Adult zebrafish regenerate about half of cerebrospinal axons by six weeks after a complete spinal cord transection. We isolated the two populations of neurons that successfully regenerated their axons versus those that did not and isolated the total RNA. Cerebrospinal neurons from unlesioned animals were also collected to serve as controls. Whole transcriptome microarray was performed to determine axonal regeneration-associated genes. For each condition (regenerated, non-regenerated and control neurons) we had 3 biological replicates that consisted of neurons pooled from 3 to 9 zebrafish.

DESIGN
A complete spinal cord transection with Fluororuby retrograde tracing was performed at the 8th vertebra level in adult zebrafish. Fluororuby labeled all the neurons in the brain that project their axons to the 8th vertebra. Three weeks later Fluoroemerald was injected 4mm distally from the spinal cord transection site, thereby labeling all neurons that regenerated their axons to this level. The zebrafish were sacrificed 1 week after Fluoroemerald tracing, brain enzymatically dissociated and cells sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorter. After sorting the total RNA was extracted, amplified and labeled with biotin and then hybridized to Affymetrix 3' IVT gene expression microarray. Unlesioned fish were traced with Fluororuby at the 8th vertebra level and labeled neurons isolated 1 week after to serve as control for gene expression microarray.
