TITLE
Chromosome copy number variation in Cryptococcus neoformans influences virulence and occurs in isolates from AIDS patients

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Influence of  copy number changes at several chromosomes to melanin production and virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans

DESIGN
Black(B4) and white(W2) strains were compared to each other. Black variant from white strain (W2BA1) is also compared to the black strain(B4).
