TITLE
Evaluation of chronic sublethal effects effects of the organophosphate flame retardant Tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP) using Daphni magna transcriptomic response

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to measure chronic sublethal effects of the flame retardant Tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP) on gene expression, associated protein activity and life-history endpoints (reproduction, development) in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. We exposed < 24h old D. magna neonates for 21 days to culture medium (control) and to 3 sublethal doses of TBEP: 14.7, 147 and 1470 µg/L. Exposure doses were chosen from 48h acute toxicity testing and represent 1/10000, 1/1000 and 1/100 of the LC50, respectively. Each condition (control and the 3 different doses) were performed on 3 independant biological replicates, with 10 individuals each. We used a custom 15000 sequences D. magna microarray to measure transcriptional effect of each of the TBEP doses in comparison to unexposed controls.

DESIGN
We exposed < 24h old Daphnia magna to culture medium (unexposed controls) and 3 sublethal doses of TBEP (14.7µg/L, 147µg/L and 1470µg/L) for 21 days. We used 3 biological replicates of 10 individuals for each condition.
