TITLE
HIV-1 indcued genes in human monocyte-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 infection of monocyte-derived macrophages does not elicit a detectable type I IFN response in vitro, however, previously published data has shown that blocking STAT1 and STAT3 inhibits HIV-1 replication. Here we test to see if low levels of IFN inducible genes are detectable in human monocyte-derived macrophages that have been infected with HIV-1 in vitro.

DESIGN
Monocytes from 5 healthy human donors were differentiated into macrophages in vitro and infected with HIV-1-AD for 7 days. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression was assessed.
