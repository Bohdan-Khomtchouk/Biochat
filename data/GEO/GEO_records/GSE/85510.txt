TITLE
Major roles of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, nucleotide excision repair and ATR in the alternative splicing response to UV irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) is the main process that amplifies DNA information and is a crucial target of signaling cascades resulting from UV irradiation of human cells. The specific impact of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at the transcriptional and AS levels has not been addressed. By using a CPD photolyase, a flavoenzyme that directly reverts CPDs, we analyze the contribution of this lesion to the expression program in human keratinocytes.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) expressing the CPD photolyase from Potorous tridactylus in three different conditions: 1. Control: Non treated cells and inactive photolyase. 2. UV treated cells: 15 J/m2 (UVC, 254 nm) and inactive photolyase, harvested 6 hours after UV irradiation and 3. Same as before but with an active photolyase due to exposure to white light for 2 hours.
