TITLE
Responses of Pelagibacterales strains to phosphate limitation

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 ; Candidatus Pelagibacter sp. HTCC7211

SUMMARY
Responses of Pelagibacterales strains to phosphate limitation

DESIGN
Batch cultures of two different strains of P. ubique (HTCC1062 and HTCC7211) were grown in a defined artificial seawater media. Biological replicates of each strain were given no phosphate amendment, and three other cultures received an excess concentration of phosphate. Cultures were harvested for microarray analyses over a time course for the purpose of observing differences in gene expression related to phosphate limitation.
