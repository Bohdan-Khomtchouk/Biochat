TITLE
Global transcriptome profile of S aureus treated with celecoxib and ampicillin in combination

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in combination with antibiotic sensitizes S aureus to antibiotic thereby decreasing the MIC of antibiotic. The present study is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism of action of celecoxib on S aureus growth by microarray analysis. The results were analysed and the data clearly shows global change in the expression levels of S aureus genes in presence of celecoxib. Many virulence genes, essential genes and nonessential genes are down-regulated in presence of celecoxib in combination with ampicillin when compared to drug treatment alone.
