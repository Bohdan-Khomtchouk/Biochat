TITLE
Genomic copy number aberrations of 11 gastric cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic copy number aberrations of 11 gastric cancer cell lines were analyzed by 244k CGH array from Agilent Technologies. Based on this results, we separated the 11 cell lines into 2 groups, with and without copy number increase at chromosome 20q13

DESIGN
We performed array comparative genomic hybridization to detect genomic copy number aberrations in 11 gastric cancer cell lines. Microarray images were analyzed by using Feature Extraction and DNA analytics softwares.
