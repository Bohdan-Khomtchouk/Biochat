TITLE
PAHM4 vs PAO1 37C LB

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAHM4

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAHM4 and PAO1 were grown at 37C on LB and RNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix P. aeruginosa chip to compare transcript differences from a BQ isolate to a well characterized wound isolate.

DESIGN
Strains PAHM4 and PAO1 were grown in triplicate.  Total RNA from each sample was pooled and amplified then assayed in triplicate resulting in 6 total samples.  PAO1 is the control strain while PAHM4 is the experimental strain.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
