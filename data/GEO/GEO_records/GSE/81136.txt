TITLE
Expression data from MeGRX232-OE and MeGRX360-OE Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
MeGRX232 and MeGRX360 are drought-inducible CC-type glutaredoxins in cassava. Overexpression of them in Arabidopsis caused different effects on plant growth. We used microarray to identified the different expression genes in MeGRX232-OE and MeGRX360-OE Arabidopsis

DESIGN
Experiments were performed as three biological repeats using cDNAs prepared independently from three individual homozygote lines that have been phenotypic analyzed in plant growth. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carried the pG1300 vector were used as control.
