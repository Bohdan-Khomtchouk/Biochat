TITLE
Distinct signal transduction pathways downstream of the (P)RR revealed by microarray and ChIP-chip analyses [Expt: ChIP-chip]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a set of microarray and chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments using siRNA against the (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR), stable overexpression of PLZF, the PLZF translocation inhibitor genistein and the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin to dissect transcriptional pathways downstream of the (P)RR.

DESIGN
In this dataset, we include the ChIP-chip data obtained from PLZF overexpressing KELLY cells, from PLZF overexpressing HEK293T cells and from KELLY as well as HEK293T cells both stably transfected with an insertless control vector.
