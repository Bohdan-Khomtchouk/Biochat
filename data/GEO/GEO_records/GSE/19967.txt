TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of siRNA Knock-Down of Six1, Six4 and Myogenin in C2C12

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Six1, Six4 and Myogenin are transcription factors that are known to be required for skeletal myogenesis. Currently, very little is known about the genes targeted by Six1 and Six4. Gene expression profiling when one or both transcription factors were knock-down by siRNA was performed to identify genes affected by their absence. We also hypothesized that Six1 and Six4 can work in cooperation with the myogenic regulatory factor (MRFs) family of transcription factors, such as Myogenin. Therefore, we performed the same type of experiment where the myogenin was knocked-down by siRNA to identify genes that are possibly regulated by the Six1 or Six4 in conjunction with Myogenin.

DESIGN
C2C12 Myoblasts were transfected with siRNA against Six1, Six4, Six1 with Six4, Myogenin, or control 24h before start of differentiation. The cells were allowed to differentiate in differentiation medium for 24h and were harvested for gene expression profiling. Four replicates per siRNA were performed.
