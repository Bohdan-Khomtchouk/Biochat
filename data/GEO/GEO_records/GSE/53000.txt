TITLE
Expression data from spatially separated samples of different ccRCC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have sampled several tumour regions from nine clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)  patients to investigate intra-tumour heterogeneity.

DESIGN
We selected 56 tumour samples and 6 normal samples from the 9 patients for expression analysis using microarray data. All samples were fresh frozen upon extraction.
