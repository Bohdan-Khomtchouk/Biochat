TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia and/or paclitaxel or epirubicin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxia protects cancer cells from chemotherapeutic drug-induced cell death. We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression underlying hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in cancer cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 were exposed to paclitaxel or epirubicin under normoxia or hypoxia for 16hours, then RNA was extracted and analyzed by Affymetrix arrays

PLATFORM
