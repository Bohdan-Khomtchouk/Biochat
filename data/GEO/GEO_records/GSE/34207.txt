TITLE
Atypical DNA methylation of genes encoding cysteine-rich peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, transposons and non-protein-coding repeats are epigenetically silenced by CG and non-CG methylation. This pattern of methylation is mediated in part by small RNAs and two specialized RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation.  By contrast, many protein-coding genes transcribed by Pol II contain in their gene bodies exclusively CG methylation that is independent of small RNAs and Pol IV/Pol V activities. It is unclear how the different methylation machineries distinguish between transposons and genes. Here we report on a group of atypical genes that display in their coding region a transposon-like methylation pattern, which is associated with gene silencing in sporophytic tissues.

DESIGN
We performed a methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism analysis to search for targets of RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana and identified several members of a gene family encoding cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs). We also examined small RNA abundance at individual CRP genes in the wild type plant, nrpd1, and rdr2 mutant plants.
