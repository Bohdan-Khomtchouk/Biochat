TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of  gene expression in rat hippocampus exposed to chronic stress and albiforin treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed high-throughput profiling of gene expression in rat hippocampus in response to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and albiflorin treatment.  Total 415 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in rat hippocampus in response to albiflorin treatment compared with CUMS rats treated with saline (CUMS-Sal). We conducted the integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis and found the correction of 16 biochemical pathways by albiflorin such as sphingolipids, phospholipids, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Our study provided deep insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant actions of albiflorin.

DESIGN
Rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 5-weeks. At the last week of the exposure, rats were treated with saline, fluoxetine (7 mg/kg/d) or albiflorin (7 mg/kg/d) for 7 days.  Total 4 groups were set up:  rats without CUMS exposure and with saline treatment (Control-Sal), rats received CUMS and saline (CUMS-Sal), rats received CUMS and fluoxetine (CUMS-Flx) and rats received CUMS and albiflorin (CUMS-Alb). Three replicates were used for each group.
