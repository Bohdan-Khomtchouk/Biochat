TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mouse macrophages stimulated with IL-4 (bone marrow macrophages) (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of alternative activation of macrophages at gene expression level. The study forms part of a wider study where we compare the effects of IL-4 in different human and mouse macrophages. Our results support the notion that in vitro culture conditions greatly affect the macrophage response to IL-4. Total RNA obtained from bone marrow derived macrophages upon exposure to 20 ng/ml of IL-4 for 18 hours.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages were stimulated with the Th2 cytokine IL-4, for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
