TITLE
Targeted DNA methylation analysis of the imprinted loci FAM50B and ZDBF2 in a cohort of small for gestational age born children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this cohort of 52 individuals born small for gestational age we analyzed the DNA methylation of the two imprinted genes ZDBF2 and FAM50B using CpGs from these loci represented on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k Bead Chip.This cohort partly overlaps with an already published cohort analyzed for the potential influence of growth hormone therapy on the DNA methylation (GSE57205). Our analysis revealed one individual with a hypermethylation in ZDBF2.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA of peripheral blood from 52 individuals  born small for gestational age were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k Bead Chip array.
