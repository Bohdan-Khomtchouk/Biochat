TITLE
Epigenome analysis of dnmt target sites [3ABDKO cell line]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of target sites of dnmt3b isoforms in HCT derivative cell line 3ABDKO followed by 5-Aza-CdR treatment. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
