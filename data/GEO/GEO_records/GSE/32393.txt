TITLE
Epigenome analysis of breast tissue from women with and without breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in breast tissues from women with and without breast cancer. Breast tissue samples were drawn from 114 breast cancers and 23 non-neoplastic breast tissues. The breast cancer tissue samples were from women (mean age 59.4) who were diagnosed with breast cancer.  Among the cancers, 33 were at stage 1 and 81 at stage 2/3/4; 34, 59, and 19 were grade 1, 2, and 3 respectively;and 91 were invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancers. The 23 non-neoplastic samples are from healthy woman (mean age 47.6).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 137 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
