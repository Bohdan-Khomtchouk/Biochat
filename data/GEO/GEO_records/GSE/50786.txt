TITLE
Comparison of histone deacetylase 9-1 mutant (SALK_001723) dry seed transcriptome with Col wild-type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of dry hda9-1 mutant seeds with those of Col wild-type seeds, using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. The hda9-1 mutant has reduced primary seed dormancy. We used microarrays to dissect which genes are differentially expressed in the hda9-1 mutant to study the mechanisms how HDA9 affects seed dormancy and germination

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from tagged dry 18-19-DAP siliques of wild-type Col and the hda9-1 mutant following an adapted protocol of the RNAqueous small scale Phenol-free total RNA isolation kit in addition with RNA isolation aid (Ambion, Austing, TX, USA), as described in Liu et al. (2011) PLoS ONE and Van Zanten et al. (2011) PNAS. Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome-Micro hybridization was performed at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne. Three independent hybridizations of independent biological replicates, obtained from several dry siliques of at least five plants per replica, were performed.
