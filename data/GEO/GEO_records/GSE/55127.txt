TITLE
Gene expression signature induced by 8 weeks of cigarette smoke exposure in the lung of BALB/c mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the impact of cigarette smoke on lung gene expression, female BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River at 6-8 weeks of age. Using a whole body exposure system (SIU48, PROMECH LAB AB, Vintrie, Sweden), mice (5 per group) were exposed to room air or the mainstream cigarette smoke of twelve 3R4F reference cigarettes (University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA) with filters removed 5 days per week, twice daily for 50 minutes/exposure for 8 weeks, as previously described. Control animals were exposed to room air only. Lungs were collected and stored in RNALater at -80Â°C prior to RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Impact of an 8 week cigarette smoke exposure on BALB/c mouse lung gene expression was assessed.
