TITLE
Differential gene expression in mice liver following apigenin administration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in mice liver after apigenin administration. Gene expression from control mice were compared with apigenin treated mice at different dose level.

DESIGN
To study differential expression primarily at high stringency and in dose dependent manner was to increase the statistical confidence in the detection of important genes and cellular processes with a probable role in the initiation and propagation of toxicity as well as those possibly involved in regeneration during the early phase of tissue response.
