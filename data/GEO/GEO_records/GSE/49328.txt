TITLE
Gene expression on in vitro activated DCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the effects of IL-27 signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) in the activation and polarization of effector and regulatory T cells, and the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model of multiple sclerosis. In this dataset, we include the results of treating DCs with IL-27.

DESIGN
Primary splenic C57BL/6 DCs were isolated, cultured in vitro +/- IL-27 and RNA was prepared.
