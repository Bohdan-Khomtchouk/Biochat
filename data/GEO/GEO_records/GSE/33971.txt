TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and propolis sensitivity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The main objective was to identify genes regulated after the BY4742 yeast cells were exposed to 0.125% for 5 or 10 min. The experiment was further valited by microbiological assays.

DESIGN
The control for this experiment that used 0.125% propolis as a treatment have 0.68% ethanol for 5 or 10 min (what corresponds to 60% alcoholic extract for 0.125% propolis). For analysis, the cells were exposed to 0.125% for 5 or 10 min were compared to the control.
