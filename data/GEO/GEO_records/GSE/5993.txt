TITLE
mRNA expression profiling of p63-depleted versus wildtype ME180 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional effects of p63 binding by analyzing ME180 cells depleted for all p63 isoforms via expression of a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the p63 oligomerization domain. Keywords: differential expression profiling from transcription factor depletion

DESIGN
Data were collected from three biological replicates for p63-depleted and control cells respectively.
