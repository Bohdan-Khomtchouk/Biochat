TITLE
Transcriptom analyses of Arabidopsis altered meritem program1-32 (amp1-32) mutant as well as wild-type Columbia-0 plants via next-generation sequencing (NGS).

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Purpose:The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome of amp1-32 mutant with that of wild-type Columbia-0 plant and to identify genes whose expression are tightly regualted by AMP1 in Arabidopsis. Methods: mRNA profiles of 3-week-old wild-type Col-0 and amp1-32 mutant plants were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with a method : TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30~53 million sequence reads per sample to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10). From the 2 biological replicates, we detected 135 up-regulated genes, and 36 down-regulated genes, in the amp1-32 mutant plant. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of transcriptome of amp1 mutant plants, with biologic replicates. Our results show that AMP1 protein had weak, but significant, effects on transcription of genes important for plant development and responses to stresses.
