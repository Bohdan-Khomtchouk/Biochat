TITLE
Microarray analysis of Haemophilus parasuis SH0165 genomics induced by tilmicosin

ORGANISM
Haemophilus parasuis SH0165

SUMMARY
To gain an extensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tilmicosin, we can begin by understanding the different regulated responses of bacteria to tilmicosin and studying the physiological activity of bacteria. In this study, we used microarray technology to analyze the variation of the H. parasuis SH0165 transcriptional profile in response to inhibitory and sub-inhibitory concentrations of tilmicosin. Our analysis to identify several genes whose system could be involved in the protection from antibiotic stress targeting the ribosome 50 subunit and help to confer the basal level of H. parasuis responses to antibacterial drugs, such as heat shock protein, ribosome and ribosome related transcription genes, the cell wall biogenesis genes. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of fifteen selected genes.

DESIGN
H. parasuis SH0165 was induced by 0.25µg/ml tilmicosin at OD600 > 0.3 (16 h). The 8µg/ml tilmicosin treatment was 50 mins at OD600 > 0.3 (12 h). The H. parasuis SH0165 control group was normal culture with no tilmicosin at OD600 > 0.3 (12 h). Three independent experiments were performed on each group using a different sample for each experiment.
