TITLE
Whole genome expression in meningioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling of 24 meningioma and two dura controls analyzing 55000 transcripts including 18300 known genes. We compared expression in meningioma vs. dura, expression of low grade (WHO I) vs. higher-grade (WHO II and WHO IIII) tumors and expression of meningothelial and syncytial meningioma vs. fibroblastic meningioma.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analysed in 24 meningioma including eight of each WHO grade and two dura controls analyzing 55000 transcripts including 18300 known genes.
