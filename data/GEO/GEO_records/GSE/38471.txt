TITLE
Enhancing Mammary Differentiation by Overcoming Lineage Specific Epigenetic Modification and Signature Gene Expression of Fibroblast Derived iPSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies showed that Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could hold memory of their origin and exhibit skewed differentiation potential. This finding reveals a severe limit for the application of iPSCs in cell-based therapy in case certain cell types are not available for reprograming from patients. Here we show that under a typical condition for mammary differentiation, iPSCs derived from mouse mammary epithelium cells (ME-iPSCs) exhibit mammary signature gene expression and chromatin epigenetic modification, leading to smooth progress for mammary gland formation. In contrast, iPSCs reprogramed from tail fibroblasts (TF-iPSCs) displayed fibroblast specific signature that is not compatible for mammary differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, when co-culturing with ME-iPSCs or under pregnant condition, the fibroblast specific signature of TF-iPSCs was erased and the cells gained enhanced ability for mammary differentiation. These findings provide new insights into the precise control of differentiation conditions for future personalized cell-based therapy.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of three cell types with three biological replications.
