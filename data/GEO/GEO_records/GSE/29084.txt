TITLE
Expression Data from HNF4a RNAi Knockdown in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HNF4a is an important liver transcription factor that regulates at least a thousand genes in the liver. Here we used expression profiling in HepG2 cells, a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, in which HNF4a was knocked down by RNAi to identify some of those target genes. This dataset accompanies the article in Hepatology 2010 Feb;51(2):642-53.

DESIGN
RNA interference (RNAi) against HNF4a2 was performed in HepG2 cells using small, interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to nucleotides +179 to +197 of human HNF4A (NM_178849, sense siRNA: 5'-UGUGCAGGUGUUGACGAUGdTdT-3', antisense siRNA 5'-CAUCGUCAACACCUGCACAdTdT-3') (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcribed with the Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed in the linear range (see Supporting Table 3B for a list of PCR primers). Expression profiling analysis was performed with Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays (HGU133 Plus 2.0) using RNA from control (PGL3 siRNA) or treated (HNF4a siRNA) HepG2 cells
