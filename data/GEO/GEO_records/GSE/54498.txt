TITLE
Effect of Dot1l deletion on LSKs and GMPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to investigate the effects of Dot1l deletion on gene expression in LSKs and GMPs of C57/BL6 mice Aberrant Hox gene activation is a recurrent feature in several different types of human leukemia, including leukemias with rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. In this study, we demonstrate that Hox gene expression is controlled by higher degree H3K79 methylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that the deposition of progressive H3K79 methylation states at the genomic loci of critical Hox genes is dependent on the interaction of the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1l with Af10, a protein that is found in the Dot1l complex isolated from diverse cell types. Furthermore, abrogation of the Dot1l-Af10 interaction reverses aberrant epigenetic profiles found in the leukemia epigenome and impairs the transforming ability of mechanistically distinct AML oncogenes.

DESIGN
Lineage negative Sca-1 positive Kit positive (LSK) cells and granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) were sorted from Dot1 wt/wt x Mx-Cre mice or Dot1l fl/fl x Mx-Cre mice were injected with PIPC. PIPC injection induced biallelic deletion of the Dot1l allele in the Dot1l fl/fl mice but not the Dot1l wt/wt mice. The Dot1l wt/wt LSKs and GMPs were compared to the Dot1l -/- counterparts by RNA extraction and Microarrays.
