TITLE
Notch ChIPseq in Angptl2 treated CD34 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ANGPTL2 is a protein in the angiopoietin-like protein family and plays a role in hematopoietic and vascular physiology.  This study examined the effects of ANGPTL2 on CD34+ human hematopoetic progenitor cells.

DESIGN
2 samples total; 1 sample from ChIPseq with Notch antibody in Angptl2-stimulated CD34+ cells and the other is the input ChIP DNA

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
