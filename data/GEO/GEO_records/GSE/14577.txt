TITLE
A Gene Signature for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human genome-wide Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were used to compare the levels of gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) of male patients with post-viral chronic fatigue (n=8) and male healthy control subjects (n=7). Patients and healthy subjects differed significantly in the level of expression of 366 genes. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated functional implications in immune modulation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Prototype biomarkers were identified on the basis of differential levels of gene expression and possible biological significance. Differential expression of key genes identified in this study offer an insight into the possible mechanism of chronic fatigue following infection. The representative biomarkers identified in this research appear promising as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Keywords: comparison between two groups of samples

DESIGN
Two groups of patients: Chronic Syndrom Fatigue (CFS) patients (n=8) and control patients (n=7).
