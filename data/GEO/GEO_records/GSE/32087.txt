TITLE
Expression data in an Arabidopsis cytokinin-deficient mutant, ipt1,3,5,7 and its wild type plant (Col-0) under high salinity and control conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of cytokinins (CKs) in salt stress response, we have employed transcriptional profiling of the CK-deficient mutant, ipt1,3,5,7 and wild type plant, Col-0 under high salinity and control conditions to identify genes differentially expressed in ipt1,3,5,7 under salt stress and control conditions. Agilent's Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
10-d-old plants grown on GM medium (22ÂºC, 16-h-light/8-h-dark) were transfered onto 1/2 MS agar plates without sucrose containing either 0 or 200 mM NaCl. Independent biological samples, 10 plants/each biological replicate, were collected after 24 hours. Total RNA was prepared and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments were carried out for each independent biological sample.
