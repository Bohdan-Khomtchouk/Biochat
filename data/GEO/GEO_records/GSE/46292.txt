TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving Interferon-beta therapy [TaqMan(r) Array Human MicroRNA B Cards v2.0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression dynamics of mRNAs and microRNAs in response to subcutaneous IFN-beta-1b treatment (Betaferon, 250 Âµg every other day) in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) or relapsing-remitting type of the disease (RRMS). By using TaqMan Array MicroRNA Cards, we obtained microRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 6 patients within the first month of IFN-beta treatment.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first, second and third IFN-beta injection as well as after 1 month. Total RNA of Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each sample was extracted. Real-time PCR measurements were performed in 384-well plates with TaqMan assay reagents to quantify the microRNA expression levels. This GEO entry provides the data of the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA B Cards v2.0.
