TITLE
Application of a 9k-cDNA microarray for identification of albendazole and artemisinin targeting genes in Echinococcus granulosus larval protoscoleces

ORGANISM
Echinococcus granulosus

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray composed of 9065 uniEST probes was constructed and applied to detect the gene expression profile of protoscoleces of E. granulosus treated with albendazole and artemisinin in vitro, respectively. Compared with the untreated parasite, 7 genes were up-regulated and 38 genes were down-regulated in protoscoleces treated with albendazole and 100 genes were up-regulated and 6 genes were down-regulated in protoscoleces treated with artemisinin. The differential expression genes in protoscoleces induced by albendazole were clustered into energy metabolism, cell cycle and assembly of cell structure. And the differential expression genes affected by artemisinin were clustered into genetic information, the transduction of environmental signals, metabolism. Under transmission electron microscope observation, albendazole intervention damaged the cell structure, and form the heterochromatin in protoscoleces cells was mainly increased in the artemisinin group.

DESIGN
Isolated E. granulosus protoscoleces were treated with albendazole and artemisinin respectively and was extracted of total RNA using the TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-expression profiling was performed for each RNA sample separately on the GeneChip of Echinococcus granulosus Genome Array (Capitalbio) at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).
