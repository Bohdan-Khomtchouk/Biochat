TITLE
Identification of CITED2 target genes in human CB

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CB CD34+ cells were were transduced with control (tNGFR) or CITED2 overexpression lentivectors, or control (shSCR) or shRNA CITED2 lentivectors and mRNA was isolated in order to investigate global gene expression changes upon perturbation of CITED2.

DESIGN
CB CD34+ cells were isolated by Miltenyi miniMACS column. Cells were prestimulated in HPGM with 100 ng/ml KITL, FLT3L and TPO for 12 hrs. Cells were transduced with control (tNGFR) or CITED2 overexpression lentivectors, or control (shSCR) shRNA CITED2 lentivectors, in three rounds over 48 hrs. Transduced cells were sorted after which RNA was isolated for Illumina beadhchip arrays HT12 v4.
