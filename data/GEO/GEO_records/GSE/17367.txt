TITLE
Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns of  PTC1 null mutant in Response to  Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The evaluation of the toxicity of Aflatoxin B1 using yeast gene expressions. Yeast strain; BY4743 PTC1 mutant, was used for this study. SDS was used to raise the penetration of the yeast cell membrane.
