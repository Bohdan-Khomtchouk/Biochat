TITLE
Chronic academic stress increases a group of microRNAs in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined alterations in microRNA (miRNA) profiles in peripheral blood from male medical students two months and two days before the National Examination for Medical Practitioners. Blood obtained one month after the examination were used as baseline controls. Several miRNAs were significantly elevated during the pre-examination period in association with significant down-regulation of their target mRNAs two days before the examination. Thus, a distinct group of miRNAs in periheral blood may participate in the integrated response to chronic academic stress in healthy young men

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from venous blood which was taken from young male medical students. 12 samples from 4 subjects at three time points: two months before, two days before, and one month fater the examination were measured on array platform.
