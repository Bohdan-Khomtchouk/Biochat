TITLE
Transcriptome comparison between WT mESC and Tet1,2,3 TKO mESC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a DNA base created during active DNA demethylation by the recently-discovered Tet enzymes, and plays essential roles in gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that large quantities of 5hmC are found at sites of DNA damage and repair. 5hmC accumulates at damage foci induced by aphidicolin and microirradiation, and colocalizes with major DNA damage response proteins 53BP1 and Î³H2AX, revealing 5hmC as an epigenetic marker of DNA damage. Deficiency for the Tet enzymes eliminates damage-induced 5hmC accumulation, alters DNA repair focus formation, and elicits chromosome segregation defects in response to replication stress. Our results indicate that the Tet enzymes and 5hmC create an epigenetic switch that plays an essential role in ensuring genome integrity via DNA damage response pathways. The purpose of the current dataset is to characterize the transcriptomes of WT and TetTKO cells, to determine the extent to which deficiency for DNA Damage and Repair (DDR) pathway genes contributes to the observed phenotypes in the study; namely, increased chromosomal errors at mitosis in response to 0.2 micromolar aphidicolin treatment.

DESIGN
Three wild-type mESC samples and three Tet1,2,3 TKO samples, all grown at the same time. All steps after RNA extraction performed by DNA Chip, Inc.(dna-chip.co.jp)
