TITLE
Gene expression profile in human orthotopic liver transplantation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have studied the genes activated in human liver transplantation to identify potential target genes for the prevention or treatment of related injuries. In a first protocol, in order to evaluate the effect of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) on gene expression profile, we compared gene expression levels in transplanted-reperfused livers  versus basal values in donor livers, identifying 795 genes significantly modified in human liver after transplantation. Some genes are likely to be completely activated by IRI, as they are not expressed at all in basal livers. In a second protocol, in order to identify gene dysregulations already present in donor livers, which might affect gene expression profile after transplantation, gene expression evaluated in the first study was compared to control livers (espression data retrieved from ArrayExpress database). About 900 genes in donor livers are dysregulated if compared to the control condition. At least 400 of them remain dysregulated or become more and more dysregulated after transplantation.

DESIGN
For the first protocol, two biopsies were collected from each liver: 1 biopsy before explantation from the donor, immediately after opening, before ice was applied, and 1 biopsy about 2-3 hours after liver reperfusion in the recipient organism. Gene expression of 5 transplanted livers was compared to that of 5 donor livers. In the second protocol gene expression both of transplanted and donor livers was compared to gene expression data from 5 control livers retrieved from ArrayExpress repository SAMPLE ID: E-AFMX-11
