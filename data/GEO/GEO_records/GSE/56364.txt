TITLE
Distinct expression pattern of miRNAs in Marekâ€™s disease virus infected-chicken splenic tumors and non-tumorous spleen tissues

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms of the tumorigenesis of MDV, we used microarrays to screen host and viral miRNAs that were sensitive to infection by MDV. Microarray analysis showed significant differential expression of 79 miRNAs,

DESIGN
To determine whether miRNAs were involved in the MDV-induced tumorigenesis, miRNA microarray analysis was performed on GA-infected splenic tumors, GA-infected non-tumorous spleen tissues, and control spleen tissues at 28 dpi.
