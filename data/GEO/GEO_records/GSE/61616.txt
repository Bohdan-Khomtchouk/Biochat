TITLE
The effect of XUESAITONG on gene expression profile after focal cerebral ischemia in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Xuesaitong injection (XST), a standardized patent Chinese medicine of Panax notoginseng roots (Sanqi in Chinese), has long been used for effective prevention and treatment of stroke in China. However, the mechanisms underlying its effects against ischemic stroke are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the polypharmacology of XST against ischemic stroke with a XST-regulated stroke network analysis. Male Sprague Dawley rat model of MCAO and reperfusion were administered XST for 7 days while the control group was not treated.

DESIGN
Three conditions were compared with three replicates each. These are: (1) sham; (2) model (3) XST treatment. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix rat Genome 230 2.0 chips.
