TITLE
Gene expression in rectal epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were recorded from rectal suction specimens of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, carrying the CF-specific D508 mutated CFTR-allele.  These profiles were compared with gene expression profiles from rectal suction specimens of non-CF subjects (control).

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133A microarrays to record the gene expression profile of 16 CF and 13 non-CF individuals. Rectal suction specimens representing rectal mucosal epithelia were collected from CF patients and non-CF individuals. Biopsies were analyzed for residual function using ICM and total RNA was isolation immediately using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol with on column DNA digestion.  About 1-5 Âµg RNA were obtained from each individual. Integrity of total RNA samples was monitored by gel-electrophoresis before cDNA synthesis. Labeled cRNA synthesis and hybridization was performed following standard protocols.
