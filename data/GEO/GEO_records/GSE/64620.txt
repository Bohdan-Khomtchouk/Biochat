TITLE
Detection and Characterization of Gene Expression Differences in Transgenic Glycine max Seeds with RNAseq

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Transformation of Glycine max with seed-targeted expression vectors via Agrobacterium causes measurable unscripted gene expression changes in the seed transcriptome

DESIGN
mRNA was sequenced from three transgenic events expressing three different recombinant proteins in soybean seeds.  Three plants were chosen from each as group replicates, and three seeds from each plant as individual biological replicates.
