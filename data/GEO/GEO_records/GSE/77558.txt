TITLE
Analysis of differentially expressed genes between Huntington’s disease and control iPSCs derived GABA MS-like neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, which manifests itself as a loss of GABAergic medium spiny (GABA MS) neurons in the striatum and caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. There is no cure for HD, existing pharmaceutical can only relieve its symptoms. Here, induced pluripotent stem cells were established from patients with low CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, and were then efficiently differentiated into GABA MS-like neurons under defined culture conditions. Analysis of differentially expressed genes between Huntington’s disease and wild type iPSCs derived GABA MS-like neurons has been performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three pairs of WT and HD neurons differentiated in parrallel from human pluripotent stem cells.
