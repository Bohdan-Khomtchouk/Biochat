TITLE
Adventitial tertiary lymphoid organs in AAA are a potential source of miRNAs as biomarkers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to identify and characterize miRNA expression inATLOs isolated by laser microdissection from human AAA biopsy samples. The aim of this study was to profile (with microarray technology) miRNAs in ATLOs (Adventitial tertiary lymphoid organs), isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM). Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from control non-aneurysmal aortas were the control group according to which data were normalized. ATLOs were microdissected (mean 13.5mm2)  from two different biopsy samples of human abdominal aortic aneurysm. An area enriched in smooth muscle cells was microdissected from two biopsy samples of non aneurysmal abdominal aortas. Each microdissected samples were analyzed independently on microarray.

DESIGN
ATLOs located in human abdominal aneurysmal aortas were each analyzed in duplicate (each isolated from different human donors of abdominal aortic aneurysm). Data were normalized with smooth muscle cells isolated from human abdominal non aneurysmal aortas.
