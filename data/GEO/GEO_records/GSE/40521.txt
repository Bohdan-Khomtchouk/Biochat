TITLE
High Glucose (HG) treated morula vs control glucose (CTL) treated morula

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Early bovine cleavage (day 0 to 3) was treated with high glucose (5mM) or control glucose (0.2mM) then total day 3 embryos were cultured in control condition until day 5 when gene expression was assessed in developping morula by microarray

DESIGN
4 replicates of 10 morulae/rep was produced for high glucose and control treatment. According to a dye swap design, 4 arrays were used, one array for each comparison between HG and control, i.e replicate 1 from HG were compared to replicate 1 from CTL, rep 2 from HG were compared to rep 2 from CTL, rep 3 HG vs rep 3 CTL, rep 4 HG vs rep 4 CTL.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
