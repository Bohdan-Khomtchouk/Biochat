TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse embryonic stem cells (D3-pOCT-mESC) grown in low concentrations of nitric oxide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the genes regulated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) by the effect of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), we analysed the transcriptome of cells treated with NO and compared it to those of cells cultured in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and in the presence of LIF. We used the cell line D3-pOct4, which carries the enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein gene (eGFP) under the control of the Oct-4 promotor. This line is continuously maintained in the undifferentiated state in the presence of LIF, in comparison with the wild type line .
