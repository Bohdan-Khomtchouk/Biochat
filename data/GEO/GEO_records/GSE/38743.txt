TITLE
Acquired resistance of Jurkat cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in various cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. However, in clinical trials administration of recombinant TRAIL or TRAIL death receptor agonists did not show sufficient efficacy for treatment of tested malignant disorders compared to standard chemotherapy. Acquired resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL and to other “death receptor” ligands may explain not only the inability of TRAIL and TRAIL “death receptor” agonists to achieve the clearance of cancer cells in vivo but also the escape of cancer cells from immune cell – mediated killing. Selective pressure of TRAIL on TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells provided several TRAIL resistant Jurkat cell line clones (TR1, TR2, TR3). We showed that acquired TRAIL resistance was associated with complex disruption of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways manifested by acquired multi-drug resistant phenotype of TR1, TR2, and TR3 clones. To identify changes associated with TRAIL resistance of Jurkat cells we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of TRAIL-resistant clones (TR) and compared to WT Jurkat cells. We identified significantly increased expression (1.33-fold change with adjusted p < 0.05) of 73 genes in TR1 clone, 53 genes in TR2 clone and 8 genes in TR3 clone, and significant decrease in expression (0.75-fold change with adjusted p < 0.05) of  174 genes in TR1 clone, 36 genes in TR2 clone and 28 genes in TR3 clone. There was an overlap of only 2 significantly overexpressed (midkine / MDK and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 gene / ZBTB16 / PLZF)   and 4 downregulated genes (YAP1, IGJ, EIF1AY, RPS4Y1) in all three TR clones.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was isolated from biologic duplicates of untreated Jurkat cells (WT) and TRAIL resistant Jurkat cell line subclones (TR1, TR2, TR3) established by selective pressure of TRAIL 1000 ng/mL on Jurkat cells over the period of 12 weeks.
