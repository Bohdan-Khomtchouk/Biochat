TITLE
Gene expression in three independent resynthesized Brassica napus allopolyploid lines and their diploid progenitors

ORGANISM
Brassica napus ; Brassica rapa ; Brassica oleracea ; Brassica sp.

SUMMARY
We anlalyzed gene expession using an Arabidopsis 26K 70mer spotted microarray Differential expression was tested using two ANOVA models: 1) a per-gene variance ANOVA, and 2) a common variance ANOVA

DESIGN
We compared gene expession between the diploid progenitors (Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea), and tested mid-parent expression in the allopolyploids by comparison to a reference sample (composed of a 1:1 mix of parental RNA).  Two biological replicates (composed of pooled leaf tissue) were each analzed with two dye swaps in a randomized complete block design(RCBD).
