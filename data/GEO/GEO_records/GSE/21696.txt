TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of RXRa binding in mouse liver chromatin with ChIP-SEQ.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For the genome-wide analysis using ChIP-Seq on mouse liver cells, a full accounting of all RXRÎ± binding sites and of RXRa related gene regulations is expected to address the main knowledge gap around RXRÎ±.

DESIGN
Liver tissue of wild type and hs-RXRa-del-exon4-/- mice, male and female for each genotype have been ChIP-Seq'ed for RXRa and Pol2.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
