TITLE
RA heat-shock

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Within a GRO experiment, samples for mRNA amount (RA) were taken at 0, 4, 11, 16, 26 and 40 minutes after heat stress (from 25ºC to 37ºC). Analysis was done in filters also used for Transcription rate (TR) analysis of aliquots from the same cultures.

DESIGN
The analysis includes 3 repeats of stress treatment of the W3030-1a strain. The same times were used for sampling in each repeat of the experiment. A single genomic DNA hybridization on every one of the filters is used for normalization between gene probes.
