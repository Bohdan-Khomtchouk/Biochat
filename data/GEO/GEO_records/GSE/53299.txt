TITLE
Expression data from mouse protein iPS cells compared to mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse hepatocyte.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increased genomic integrity an improved protein-based iPS cell method compared to current viral induced strategies We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of protein-based iPS cells

DESIGN
Total RNAs were prepared from mH, mES, miPS cells usingTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and their cDNAs were allowed to hybridize to Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430 containing over 43,000 mouse transcripts at the Harvard Partners Center for Genomics and Genetics.

PLATFORM
