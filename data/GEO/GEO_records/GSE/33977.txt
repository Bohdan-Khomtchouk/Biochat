TITLE
Seasonal differences in expression patterns of LMPC-enriched poplar wood rays

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Ray cells were enriched from wood samples of poplar (Populus x canescens) by LMPC and transcripts monitored by poplar whole genome microarrays. Results provided insight into molecular processes during the transition from dormancy to flowering in early spring in contrast to the active growth phase in summer.

DESIGN
4 samples of summer (July) 4 of early spring (February) from Populus x canescens field-culture

PLATFORM
GPL4359 [Poplar] Affymetrix Poplar Genome Array
