TITLE
Marfan syndrome in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome expression profiles to characterize gene expression during development of thoracic aortic aneurysm in fibrillin-1 hypomorphic mice (Fbn1mgR/mgR).

DESIGN
We compared biological processes identified from transcriptomic analyses of aortic tissue harvested from Fbn1mgR/mgR mice, a validated model of early onset, progressive, severe Marfan syndrome (MFS).

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
