TITLE
Gene expression profile of normal v early MDS v non-MDS anemia bone marrow CD34 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early, low risk IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System) myelodysplasia (MDS) is a heterogeneous disorder where the molecular and cellular haematopoietic defects are poorly understood. To gain insight into this condition, we analyzed gene expression profiles of marrow CD34+ progenitor cells from normal karyotype, low blast count MDS patients, age-matched controls and patients with non-MDS anaemia. The aim of the study was to further understanding of the cellular defect in MDS and to identify biomarkers of disease Keywords: Disease v normal

DESIGN
Bone marrow (BM) CD34 cells were purified from patients with MDS, non-MDS anemia and from normal donors. Total RNA was extracted from Tri-reagent and quality verified on by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent). RNA was amplified by the Affymetrix small sample protocol. cRNA was hybridised to Affymetrix U133A chips under standard conditions. Initial data was analysed in MAS 5.0
