TITLE
Wolbachia mCGH of Five Supergroup A Strains

ORGANISM
Wolbachia pipientis

SUMMARY
Using microarray-based comparative genome hybridizations (mCGH), the genomic content of Wolbachia pipientis wMel from Drosophila melanogaster was compared to the Wolbachia from D. innubila (wInn), D. santomea (wSan), and three strains from D. simulans (wAu, wRi, wSim).
