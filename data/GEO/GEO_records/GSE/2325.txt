c-Myc responsive genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samples are from clones of Erythroleukemia cells C19 (parental) and c-Myc overexpressing cells Cl56 induced for 5days with Hexamethyl-bis acetamide(differentiation triggering agent) were pooled and reverse-transcribed and hybridized. Comparison of both transcriptomes give access to c-Myc responsive genes involved in differentiation. Keywords: other
