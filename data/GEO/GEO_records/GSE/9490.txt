TITLE
The effect of homocysteine on human aortic smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vascular calcification is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis and involves cell-mediated processes similar to the formation of bone (osteogenesis). Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We postulated that hcy can modulate the cells involved in atherosclerosis to promote calcification. Cell experiments were performed to assess the effect of homocysteine on the osteogenic differentiation of aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC). Keywords: dose repsonse comparison
