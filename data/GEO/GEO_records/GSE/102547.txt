TITLE
LncRNA expression profiling for 9 human plasma samples from systemic lupus erythematosus patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs, we performed lncRNA profiling using ArrayStar Human LncRNA Microarray in 24 new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). For the lncRNA microarray screening, total RNA from plasma was isolated from 12 SLE without nephritis, 12 lupus nephritis (LN) and 12 HCs. Four RNA samples were mixed togther as a pool of sample for microarray analysis. Accordingly, there were each three pooled RNA samples from 12 SLE without nephritis, 12 LN and 12 HCs for microarray analysis. Hierarchical clustering showed the plasma levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs differed significantly between 24 new-onset SLE patients and 12 control subjects. With a fold change ≥ 2 and P ≤ 0.05, we identified 1315 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs (743 lncRNAs up-regulated and 572 lncRNAs down-regulated) and 1363 differentially expressed mRNAs (745 mRNAs up-regulated and 618 mRNAs down-regulated) in plasma of SLE patients compared with control samples.
