TITLE
Expression data from IRE1a or XBP1 deficient mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IRE1a and XBP1 are key regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP1 ablation causes profound hypolipidemia in mice, and triggers feedback activation of its upstream enzyme IRE1a, instigating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), an mRNA degradation mechanism dependent on IRE1a's endoribonuclease activity. Comprehensive microarray analysis of XBP1 and/or IRE1a deficient liver identified genes involved in lipogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism as RIDD substrates, which might contribute to the suppression of plasma lipid levels by activated IRE1a.

DESIGN
To identify RIDD substrate mRNAs and direct XBP1 targets in the liver, we performed a comprehensive comparative microarray analysis of three groups of RNA samples: WT and XBP1 deficient mice, WT and IRE1a deficient mice untreated or injected with tunicamycin, and XBP1 deficient mice injected with luciferase or IRE1a siRNA.
