TITLE
Expression data from mouse skin scar after wounding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a TCF reporter mouse which  contain a LacZ gene downstream of a c-fos minimal promoter and three consensus TCF-binding motifs, we wounded skin and harvested the scar tissue one week post wounding. Healing tissue sorted to group of cells :  β-Gal+ cells (R) expression data with β-Gal- cells (L) , an analysis of gene expression was performed using Partek Genotyping Suite and Ingenuity Systems Software.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to  explore the difference in gene expression of B-Gal+ cells compare to Negative cells.Microdissected wound skin tissue was homogenized using a metal tissue smasher which pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen kit according to manufacturer’s manual. For microarray, RNA was extracted as mentioned and the quality of RNA was assessed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cDNA was generated and hybridized onto the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST chips.
