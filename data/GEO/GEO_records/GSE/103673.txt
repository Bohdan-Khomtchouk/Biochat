TITLE
Expression data of E12.5 Slc39a8 knockout (KO) embryo heart and wild type (WT) control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Slc39a8 KO mouse embryo hearts exhibit ventricle noncompaction phenotype which becomes evident at E12.5. The goal of this experiment is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between Slc39a8 KO and WT, which may be underlying the phenotype.

DESIGN
Whole heart was isolated from E12.5 mouse embryo, RNA was extracted and microarray was performed. N=4

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
