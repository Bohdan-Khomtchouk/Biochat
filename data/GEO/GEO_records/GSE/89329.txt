TITLE
The identification of key genes for the internaliztion of peroxiredoixin protein by macrophage-like cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Msr1 and Mafb were identified as essential genes for the internalization of peroxiredoxin protein by this microarray analysis. We found that Msr1 and Mafb were deficient in mutant RAW lines. Overexpression of Msr1 or Mafb in mutant RAW cells regained the activity for the efficient internalization of peroxiredoxin protein.

DESIGN
RAW cell internalized peroxiredoxin protein. Mutant RAW lines were generated by random mutagenesis with ENU treatment, which lost ability to internalize peroxiredoxin. We compared gene expression pattern between parental and mutant RAW cell line.
