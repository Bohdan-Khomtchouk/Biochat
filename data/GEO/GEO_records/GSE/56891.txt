TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of Wild-Type FVB/NJ Mouse Cardiac Small RNA, after 1 week pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides for quantitation of RNA abundances and comparison of RNA abundances within tissues and cells in a manner not possible with previous microarray technologies. 5 female mice were subjected to a sham operation, and 5 female mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). After 1 week, hearts were harvested and small RNAs were profiled using Illumina small RNA TruSeq kits.  Analyzed data have been published in Hu et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2012;109(48):19864-9, PMID: 23150554

DESIGN
10 cardiac small RNA (microRNA) profiles of 9 week-old FVB/NJ wild type (WT) mice (5 female sham, 5 female TAC) were generated on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.
