TITLE
Chip-chip from HepG2 cells with EZH2, SUZ12 and H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins including EZH2, SUZ12 and so on, which specifically catalyze trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and methylated H3K27 can be recognized by other specific binding proteins to compress chromatin structure, leading to the transcriptional repression of the target genes. To completely understand the epigenetic profile and molecular network of PcG in HCC, we performed ChIP-on-chip screens with EZH2, SUZ12 and H3K27me3 antibodies in HepG2 cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of  ChIP-on-chip results from EZH2, SUZ12 and H3K27me3.
