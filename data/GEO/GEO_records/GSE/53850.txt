TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of Human Myeloma Cell Lines Pre- and Post- 5'azacytidine Treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide miRNA expression profiling (MEP) of a panel of four human Myeloma cell lines treated with 5'azacytidine compared to control (DMSO treatment), with the objective of unmasking miRNAs silenced by DNA hypermethylation.

DESIGN
Total RNA, including miRNA, were extracted using Qiagen miRNeasy kit and profiled using Agilent Human MiRNA Array (Release 16.0, 8X60k)

PLATFORM
GPL16770 Agilent-031181 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V16.0_Microarray (miRBase release 16.0 miRNA ID version)
