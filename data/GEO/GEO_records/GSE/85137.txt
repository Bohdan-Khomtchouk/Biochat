TITLE
Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Oenococcus oeni adaptation to wine stress conditions

ORGANISM
Oenococcus oeni

SUMMARY
The correct development of malolactic fermentation depends on the capacity of Oenococcus oeni to survive under harsh wine conditions.  In this study it was characterized the transcriptomic response of O. oeni PSU-1 during the adaptation to wine-like medium (WLM). The period evaluated was from the inoculation into WLM  (12% v/v pH 3.4) until the beginning of malolactic fermentation (8h after inoculation).

DESIGN
Oenococcus oeni PSU-1 was grown in rich medium and after inoculated into wine-like medium (12% v/v, pH 3,4) . Samples were taken at different times after inoculation up to 8 hours (start of malolactic fermentation). Total RNA was analysed using a custom designed expression microarray.
