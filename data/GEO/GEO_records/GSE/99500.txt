TITLE
MiR-471-5p–Dependent Regulation of Phagocytosis/Autophagy-Associated Proteins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells is vital for germ cell development and differentiation. Using a tissue-specific miRNA transgenic mouse model, we show that interaction between miR-471-5p and autophagy member proteins regulates clearance of apoptotic germ cells via LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP).

DESIGN
Ago2 immuno-precipitation profiles of miR-471-5p–transfected Sertoli cells compared to those of scramble-transfected Sertoli cells

PLATFORM
