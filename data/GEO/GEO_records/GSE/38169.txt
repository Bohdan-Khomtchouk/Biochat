TITLE
Genome-wide identification of Ikaros binding sites in pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ikaros DNA binding proteins are important regulators of haematopoiesis and genetic deletion of Ikaros results in severe developmental disturbances, including delayed thymocyte differentiation and an early and complete block in B cell development. Although Ikaros ChIP-seq data are available for mouse thymocytes and human haematopoietic progenitors, it has not been achieved in B cell progenitors. The goal of this study was to identify Ikaros binding sites in pre-B cells to define Ikaros target genes which could explain the essential role of Ikaros proteins in B cell differentiation.

DESIGN
We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) with antibodies to the C-terminus of endogenous Ikaros in B3 cells and with anti-haemagglutinin (HA) in B3 cells transduced with epitope-tagged HA-Ikaros.
