TITLE
CXCL12 and IGF1 select for cancer cell populations with enhanced bone metastasis ability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CXCL12 and IGF1 confer on cancer cells survival advantage. Src potentiates cancer cells' reponse to CXCL12 and IGF1 by strengthening AKT activation. Long-term incubation of CXCL12 and IGF1 select for cancer cells with enhanced Src activity and bone metastasis potential.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated for three weeks in growth medium of reduced  serum concentration (0.2%) with or without CXCL12 (30 ng/ml) and IGF1 (10 ng/ml). Cell populations survive under these condidtions are expanded by regular growth medium with 10% serum. Two biological replicates were profiled for each condition.
