TITLE
Expression data from 5 rhesus tissues at 3 centers

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Novel approaches were used to generate the DNA sequence information for the rhesus GeneChip (2005). The purpose of this experiment was to test its reliability and validity of the rhesus macaque GeneChip across different tissues and centers. Keywords: reliability

DESIGN
To test the reliability of the rhesus GeneChip across different centers, RNA was isolated from five sources:  cerebral cortex, pancreas, thymus, testis, and an immortalized fibroblast cell line.  Aliquots of this RNA were sent to each of three centers:  Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Oregon National Primate Research Center and the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  Each center labeled the samples and hybridized them to two rhesus macaque GeneChips.
