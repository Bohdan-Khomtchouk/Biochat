TITLE
mRNA expression profiling of nasopharyngeal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated epithelial cancer with high prevalence in Southeast Asia. mRNA expression levels were measured for essentially all human genes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue samples and normal nasopharyngeal tissues. Data were analyzed for differential gene expression between tumor and normal tissue.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from laser-captured epithelium from 12 nasopharyngeal carcinomas and 4 normal healthy nasopharyngeal tissue specimens.
