TITLE
Effects of Kielin/Chordin-like Protein (KCP) in Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver RNA was collected from three genotypes:  WT controls, KCP knockout (KCP-KO) mutants, and KCP-Transgenic (KCP-Tg) overexpressing mice. Mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks before liver RNA extraction.

DESIGN
The differential gene expression patterns were noted between all genotypes and diets.
