TITLE
Global expression profiling to study the effect of primisulfuron herbicide treatment on Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarray (Affymetrix ATH1) we studied the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to primisulfuron (Beacon) herbicde that inhibits acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme and thus disrupts branmched chain amino acid biosynthesis. A number of genes related to amino acid, protein metabolism, growth, regulatory networks, respiratory pathways, stress, defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Keywords: Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicide stress response
