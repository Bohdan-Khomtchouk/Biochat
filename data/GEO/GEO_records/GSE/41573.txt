TITLE
Gene expression data in Meg-01 cells following transfection with platelet-enriched microRNA-1225-3p

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelets from sickle cell disease patients have differentially expressed microRNAs as compared to platelets from healthy control subjects. The objective of this study is to overexpress an upregulated miRNA,miR-1225-3p, in MEG01 cells to identify putative targets.

DESIGN
MEG-01 cells were transfected with microRNA-1225-3p mimic for overexpression. Simultaneously, a negative control (scrambled) RNA was transfected for comparison. Gene expression was measured at 24 hours after transfection.  Five independent experiments were performed at the same time in each group: microRNA-1225-3p transfected and scrambled.
