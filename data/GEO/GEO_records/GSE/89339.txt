TITLE
Genome-wide Gene Expression Profiling in DLBCL Cell Lines Treated with CUDC-907

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CUDC-907 is a small-molecule dual-acting inhibitor of HDACs and PI3Ks, which effectively suppresses the growth and survival of MYC-altered DLBCL. To evaluate the effect of CUDC-907 on MYC-associated genes, two DLBCL cell lines were treated with CUDC-907, a total of 948 differentially regulated genes were identified. 24 genes from the CUDC-907–regulated 948-gene set present either in the " HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1” 200-gene set or in the “HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V2” 58-gene set in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). We then computed the correlation coefficients (r) between gene expression levels and MYC protein levels across all samples in the TCGA DLBCL dataset. We found that mRNA expression changes induced by CUDC-907 in the two DLBCL cell lines are negatively correlated with correlation coefficients between expression levels and MYC protein level in the TCGA DLBCL dataset
