TITLE
Lytic Effect of Terpeneless Cold Pressed Valencia Orange Oil on Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus has been recognized as an important cause of human disease for more than 100 years.  Resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics is becoming an increasingly difficult problem in the management of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA) infections. One approach to the MRSA and VISA problem, involves the discovery and development of new natural antimicrobials. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils of plant origin have been recognized for many years. In this study 0.1% of commercial cold pressed terpeneless Valencia orange oil (CPV) showed inhibitory and lytic activity against MRSA and VISA. To identify the mechanisms of action of CPV genomic response of CPV treated MRSA was analyzed by transcriptional profiling. Results showed alteration in the expression of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis associated genes in the CPV treated cells.  Transmission electron microscopic observation of CPV treated MRSA cells exhibited cell wall damage and cell lysis.  Overall results of this study suggest that CPV may be a potential anti-staphylococcal agent for MRSA.
