TITLE
Stump project-- mRNA whole tissue; Volar versus non-volar acral skin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interesed in defining the gene signautre of volar skin.

DESIGN
Whole skin punch biopsies of palms, backs of hand, soles and backs of feet were submitted for Affymetrix Exon arrays. 4 replicates of each site from distinct human donors were included; total of 16 samples analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
