TITLE
Characterization of a novel mutation in O-GlcNAc transferase that segregates with disease in a family with X-linked intellectual disability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An X-chromosome exome sequencing analysis identified a mutation in O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (pL254F) in a family with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Affected patient lymohoblastoids exhibit decreased steady state OGT levels owing to an unstable protein compared to the unaffected, related male controls. Suprisingly, global O-GlcNAc levels remained remained unaltered. This prompted us to check the both protein and mRNA levels of the other cycling enzyme, O-GlcNAcase (OGA) which was also lowered. This implies that a compensation mechanism exists, however imperfect, owing to the disease state of the individuals. We performed glabal transcriptome analysis to assess any other changes in message between patients and controls.

DESIGN
Our study highlights small differences in the global transcriptome of patient lymhoblastoids that have the L254F mutation in O-GlcNAc transferase when compared to familial controls using Illumina sequencing of total RNA
