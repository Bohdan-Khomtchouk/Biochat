TITLE
HU treatment of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus solfataricus

SUMMARY
Hydroxyurea (HU) is toxic to Sulfolobus cells. To address the basis of the HU toxicity, we performed transcriptome analyses on untreated cells and cells following exposure to 5 mM HU for 4 hours.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of S. solfataricus grown for 4 hours +/- 5 mM HU. Three biological replicates pooled per sample.
