TITLE
Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) as a therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Expression, predictive value, and sensitivity to inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) plays a crucial role in the regulation of membrane phospholipid synthesis and has oncogenic properties in vitro. We have analyzed the expression of CHKA in cell lines derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and have found increased CHKA expression and a good correlation between protein expression and sensitivity to MN58b, a CHKA inhibitor that reduced cell growth through the induction of apoptosis. Accordingly, CHKA knockdown led to reduced drug sensitivity. In addition, we found that gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to CHKA inhibition and, in vitro, MN58b had synergistic effects with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, three active drugs in the treatment of PDAC. Using tissue microarrays, CHKA was found to be overexpressed in 90% of pancreatic tumors. While cytoplasmic CHKA did not relate to survival, nuclear CHKA distribution was observed in 43% of samples and was associated with survival, especially among patients with well/moderately differentiated tumors. To identify the mechanisms involved in resistance to CHKA inhibitors, we cultured IMIM-PC-2 cells with continuous incremental concentrations of MN58b and isolated a subline with a 30-fold higher IC50. RNA-Seq analysis identified up-regulation of ABCB1 and ABCB4 multidrug resistance transporters and functional studies confirmed that their up-regulation is the main mechanism involved in resistance. Overall, our findings support the notion that CHKA inhibition merits further attention as a therapeutic option in patients with PDAC.
