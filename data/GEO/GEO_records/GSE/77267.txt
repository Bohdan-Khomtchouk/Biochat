TITLE
Genome-wide map of 4 histone modifications and PolII in iPSC-derived human cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated maps of H3K4me1, H3K27ac (enhancers), H3K4me3, Pol II (promoters) and H3K27me3 (repressed chromatin) in the genome of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes

DESIGN
Differentiation of cardiomyocytes from iPSC followed by ChIP-seq of H3K27ac, H34me1, H327me3, H3K4me3 and PolII

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
