TITLE
Whole genome-wide expression profiles of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in response to drought stress

ORGANISM
Cannabis sativa

SUMMARY
Drought stress is the main environmental factor influencing hemp growth and yield. However, little is known about the response mechanism of hemp to drought stress. A total of 44.10 M tags and 8.91G bases were sequenced in the control hemp (CK) and drought stress hemp (DS) libraries. A total of 1292 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 883 up-regulated genes and 409 down-regulated genes, were identified. These results may contribute toward improving our understanding about the drought stress regulatory mechanism of hemp, and improving its drought tolerance ability.

DESIGN
3' tag-based DGE libraries were generated to exam the differentially expressed gene between drought-stressed and well-watered hemp

PLATFORM
GPL18592 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Cannabis sativa)
