TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Phanerochaete chrysosporium mycelium in presence of oak acetonic extractives

ORGANISM
Phanerochaete chrysosporium

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of  Phanerochaete chrysosporium control mycelium was compared to the transcriptome of mycelium grown on oak acetonic extractives containing medium.   The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, Department of Energy) Phanerochaete chrysosporium genome sequence version 1.   The aim of this study was to determine gene expression changes in  Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on oak extract with a special focus on detoxification systems.

DESIGN
We performed 6 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from control mycelium (3 biological replicates) and mycelium grown on oak acetonic extractives containing medium (3 biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.
