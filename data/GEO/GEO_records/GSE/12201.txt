TITLE
Differential Streptococcus agalactiae gene expression in human blood according to the blood donors

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
In the present investigation, we conducted a bacterial transcriptome dynamics analysis during GBS incubation with human blood. We observed large modification in the expression of numerous genes, but GBS transcriptome was different with the blood of one donor. More genes were up-regulated and less down-regulated in respect to the other donors.

DESIGN
The serotype III GBS reference strain NEM316 was cultivated in Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY) in 5% CO2 at 37°C until OD reached 0.7. Culture was harvested by centrifugation 8 minutes at 4000 x g at 37°C, then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fresh heparinized human blood was obtained from one healthy volunteer in accordance  with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Methodist Hospital Research Institute. The blood was maintained at 37°C no more than one hour prior to use. Bacterial suspension was then incubated with theblood at 37°C and 40°C under slight rotation to avoid sedimentation of blood and bacterial cells. Samples were removed for microarrays analysis immediately after adding bacteria, and after 30 and 90 minutes of incubation. Thus, we obtained results for five time points: immediately after mixing the bacterium with the blood (time 0), after 30 minutes of contact with blood (time 1) at 37°C and 40°C, and after after 90 minutes of contact with blood (time 1) at 37°C and 40°C.
