TITLE
Differential Streptococcus agalactiae gene expression in human blood according to the blood donors

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
In the present investigation, we conducted a bacterial transcriptome dynamics analysis during GBS incubation with human blood. We observed large modification in the expression of numerous genes, but GBS transcriptome was different with the blood of one donor. More genes were up-regulated and less down-regulated in respect to the other donors.
