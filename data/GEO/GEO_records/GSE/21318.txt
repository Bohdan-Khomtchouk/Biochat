SUMMARY
Background: The analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data in pathogen surveillance and discovery assays is a challenging task. Target template concentration, nucleic acid integrity, and host nucleic acid composition can each have a profound effect on signal distribution. Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied.  Results: An examination of both positive predictive value and false positive rates was employed to assess the utility of three well-established nonparametric methods for the analysis of viral array hybridization data: (1) Mann-Whitney U, (2) the Spearman correlation coefficient and (3) the chi-square test. Of the three tests, it was the chi-square that proved most useful.   Conclusions: The acceptance of microarray use for routine clinical diagnostics will require that the technology be accompanied by simple yet reliable analytic methods. We report that our implementation of the chi-square test yielded a combination of low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy.

DESIGN
A set of comprehensive probes covering vertebrate viruses was designed and printed using Agilent in-situ fabrication. Cells in tissue culture were infected with various viruses, then RNA was harvested. RNA was converted to cDNA, then amplified, labeled and hybridized to the array.
