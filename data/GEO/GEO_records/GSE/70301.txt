TITLE
Expression data from oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line Cal27 after lentivirus shIL-1beta transfection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line Cal27 was transfected with lentiviral shIL-1beta or scrambled shRNA. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression during this process.

DESIGN
IL-1beta was identified as one of the key node genes in oral carainogenesis in our preveious in vitro study. This in vivo study was designed to confirm the role of IL-1 beta and explore some more detail about the evolvment of IL-1 in malignant transformation.
