TITLE
miRNA signatures of antigen specific CD8+ T cells at different stages of immune response to LCMV infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs play an important role in regulating CD8+ T cell response. We used the microarray approach to profile the miRNA signatures of naïve, day 5 effector, day 8 effector, and memory CD8+ T cells. We identified a miRNA signature associated with rapidly proliferating effector CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells from P14 TCR transgenic mice were transferred to C57BL6 recipients which were subsequently infected with LCMV Armstrong. Donor P14 CD8+ T cells were sorted on day 5, day 8, or > day 60 post-infection. Naïve P14 CD8+ T cells were sorted directly from naive P14 splenocytes. The total RNA including miRNAs was extracted from sorted samples, labeled, and hybridized to Agilent Mouse miRNA microarray.
