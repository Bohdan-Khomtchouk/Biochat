TITLE
miRNA expression profile of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma LLC1 cell line cultivated in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional cell culture enriched with laminin rich extracellular matrix proteins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The extracellular matrix (ECM), as one of the key components of tumor microenvironment has a high impact on cancer development and highly influences tumor cell features. ECM contribute not only structural support to growing tumor cells, but also affect other cellular functions such as cell differentiation, migration, survival or proliferation. Moreover, gene and protein expression levels are regulated in cell-ECM interaction dependent manner. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key modulators of gene expression in various basic cellular processes where they can decrease protein synthesis through translational repression or RNA degradation. Despite miRNAs have recently emerged as important players involved in regulation of cell-ECM interactions molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. To address this question we explored miRNA expression patterns in mouse Lewis lung carcinoma LLC1 cells growing in laminin rich ECM microenvironment.

DESIGN
Total RNA enriched in small noncoding RNAs was isolated 48h after growing in two different cell culture systems
