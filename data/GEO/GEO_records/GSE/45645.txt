TITLE
cDNA microarray data after ATP treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparative gene expression analysis was performed using cDNA microarray technology in 2B4 and 1E8 cells (subclones derived from PC-3M human prostate carcinoma cell line) to identified the differentially expressed genes between ATP treated and untreated cells

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed. RNA was extracted from 2B4 and 1E8 cells, which further divided as control, ATP treatment for 6h (ATP 6h) and ATP treatment for 12h (ATP 12h), respectively.
