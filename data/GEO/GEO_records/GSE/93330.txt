TITLE
Novel Non-catalytic Substrate-selective p38Î±-specific MAPK Inhibitors with Endothelial-Stabilizing and Anti-inflammatory Activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a novel substrate-selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, UM101, and compared its effects on TNF-induced gene expression by human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECLs) with the prototypical p38 catalytic inhibitor, SB203580

DESIGN
HMVECLs were pretreated with DMSO (vehicle), UM101, or SB203580, then stimulated with TNF for 3h. Total RNA from treated cells and untreated control HMVECLs was isolated, poly(A) mRNA enriched and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform.
