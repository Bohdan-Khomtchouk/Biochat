TITLE
Germination of Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula) Seeds under Constant and Alternating Temperature

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes were investigated for Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) seeds with a focus on the effect of constant and diurnal fluctuating temperature on dormancy and germination. Leafy spurge seeds do not germinate when incubated for 21 days at 20째C constant temperatures, but nearly 30% germinate after 21 days under fluctuating temperatures 20:30째C (16:8 h). Incubation at 20째C for 21 followed by 20:30째C resulted in approximately 63% germination in about 10 days. A cDNA microarray representing approximately 22,000 unique sequences was used to profile transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
Labeled cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Alexa Fluor cDNA labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacture's protocols. Labeled cDNAs were hybridized to a custom made 23 K element microarray that contained 19,808 unigenes from the leafy spurge EST database and an additional 4,129 unigenes from a cassava EST database. A rolling circle dye swap hybridization scheme was used to compare gene expression between samples. There were three biological and two technical replications for each treatment. Microarray hybridization was visualized using a GenPix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and spot intensities and background was quantified using GenPix Pro software. Hybridization intensities were log2 transformed, and arrays were centered and normalized against each other.
