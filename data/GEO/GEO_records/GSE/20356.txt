TITLE
Evaluation of copy number alterations in the Ewing's Sarcoma cell line SKES1 with Affymetrix 500k SNP microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a result of a copy number alterations study (BAC-microarray), the SKES1 cell line was found to harbour a microdeletion in 16q23.2 SNP microarrays were applied in order to accurately delimit this alteration, finding a microdeletion of 1.04 Megabases in size.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from a SKES1 cell culture
