TITLE
Chip-chip from HCT116 cells with YBX1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YBX1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the control of transcription and translation. We identified YBX1 as an target of MEK/ERK signaling in colorectal cancer cell lines. We performed a ChIP-chip analysis of HCT116 cells to identify new potential target genes of YBX1.

DESIGN
Comparison of input DNA fragments with fragments coprecipitated with YBX1 in HCT116 cells.
