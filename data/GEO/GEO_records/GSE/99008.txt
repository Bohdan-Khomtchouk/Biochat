TITLE
AAV(Adeno-associated virus) infected human neural stem cells(hNSCs) gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The safety and efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated virus derivative (rAAVr3.45) were examined to evaluate its potential as a gene carrier for preparing interleukin-10 (IL10)-secreting human neural stem cells (HFT13) that can treat ischemic injuries or neurodegenerative diseases.

DESIGN
Two samples were prepared; One for control group (normal human neural stem cells) and the other for experimental group (human neural stem cells infected by AAV r3.45 with no transgene)

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
