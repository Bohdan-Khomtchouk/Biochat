TITLE
MINC Regulates Pervasive Transcription in Yeast and Mammals

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We want to know whether MINC(Mot1-Ino80C-NC2) suppress pervasive transcription at both euchromatin and heterochromatin Using next generation sequencing we show that Mot1, Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex (Ino80C), and NC2 (MINC) colocalize on chromatin and cooperate to suppress pervasive transcription in S. cerevisiae and murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Conclusion: Our ChIP-Seq and  mRNA-Seq data show that MINC regulates pervasive transcription in yeast and mammals

DESIGN
Here we use ChIP-seq to identify the genome-wide location of Mot1 , Ino80 and Nc2 both in yeast and mouse. Also we use anchor away and knock out in yeast and knock down in mouse to investigate the function of MINC in regulation of pervasive transcription .
