TITLE
Expression data from sorted control and Pygo2-null mouse mammary stem/basal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skin-mammary specific knockout (SSKO) of Pygo2 (K14-cre; Pygo2 flox/-) , a WNT signaling co-activator, results in defective mouse mammary gland development. The FACS sorted mammary stem cell (MaSC)/basal population from Pygo2 SSKO mammary gland displays biased differentiation towards luminal/alveolar lineage in vitro, and reduced regeneration rate of new mammary gland in vivo

DESIGN
To gain the insight into gene expression profiles in control and Pygo2 SSKO mammary epithelial cells (MECs), we sorted the freshly isolated mouse MECs into MaSC/basal (Lin-CD29hiCD24+) and mature luminal population (Lin-CD29lowCD24+CD61-), and extract total RNA for cDNA microarray analysis
