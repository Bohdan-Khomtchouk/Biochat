TITLE
Gene expression profiles from human splenic and circulating neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared to circulating neutrophils (NC cells), splenic neutrophils (NBH cells) have an activated phenotype and enhanced B cell-helper activity. The transcriptome analysis of splenic and circulating neutrophils was performed to verify whether the enhanced B cell-helper activity of splenic neutrophils correlated with a specific gene signature.

DESIGN
Unstimulated neutrophils were FACS sorted from the peripheral blood and spleen of six adult healthy subjects for RNA isolation and Agilent analysis.
