TITLE
Sox4 null mice e12.5 pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to assess global changes in gene expression pattern in the pancreas from Sox4-/- embryos vs. pancreas from Sox4 wild-type embryos at embryonic day 12.5. [Sox4 gene knock-out (Schilham, M. W. et al. (1996) Defects in cardiac outflow tract formation and pro-B-lymphocyte expansion in mice lacking Sox-4. Nature 380, 711-4.)] Embryonic pancreases from homozygous mutants and their wild-type littermates were harvested. Total RNA was isolated amplified using a linear amplification kit and used to prepare the hybridization samples through indirect labeling. Keywords = Pancreas Sox4 null e12.5 Keywords: parallel sample
