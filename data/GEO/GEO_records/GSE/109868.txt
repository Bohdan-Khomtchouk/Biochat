TITLE
Expression data of plasma microRNA from the healthy children and children who diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
According to the status of children acute lymphoblastic leukemia,we collected samples from the new dignosed, complete remmission and relapsed.

DESIGN
Twelve plasma samples from healthy children (H) and pediatric ALL were collected, including 3 samples from the healthy children, 3 pairedof samples from newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR), and relapsed (RE) patinets , respectively. The miRNA expression profiles were detected by Taqman miRNA Array. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed based on the expression of miRNAs toidentify differentially expressed miRNAs among the groups
