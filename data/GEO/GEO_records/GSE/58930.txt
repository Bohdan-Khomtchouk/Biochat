TITLE
Differential Gene Expression of Phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein (PBLD) in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our objective was to elucidate patterns of gene expression underlying the PBLD overexpression in HepG2 cells. The transcript profiles of PBLD overexpressed HepG2 cells were compared to the gene expression profiles of HepG2 cells control.

DESIGN
Gene expression is compared at a global level using total RNA from PBLD overexpressed HepG2 cells  and controls using the Illumina microarray platform.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
