TITLE
Expression data from Arid4b knockdown cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High Arid4b promotes mammary tumor growth and metastasis in mouse model systems, and is associated with poor metastasis-free survival in human breast cancer patients. Through shRNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrated that loss of Arid4b significantly inhibits the ability of mouse breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lungs. We performed microarray expression and subsequent network analysis to identify genes diferentially regulated as a consequence of Arid4b knockdown.

DESIGN
The highly metastatic mouse breast cancer cell line 6DT1 was transduced with lentiviral shRNAs targeting Arid4b (RMM4534-NM_194262, Open Biosystems) or scrambled control in the same pLKO.1 vector backbone. Stably transduced cells were selected with puromycin, then total RNA was isolated from pooled clones.
