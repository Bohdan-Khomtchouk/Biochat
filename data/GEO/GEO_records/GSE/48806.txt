TITLE
Differentially expressed genes associated with hepatic steatosis in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Expression microarray of livers from adult zebrafish: control, overfed, and ahcy+/- Comparison of expression from livers obtained from ahcy+/+, overfed ahcy+/+, ahcy+/- control and ahcy+/- overfed.

DESIGN
Adult zebrafish, ahcy+/+ and +/-, were given a regular diet or were overfed for a month. Livers were removed, RNA isolated, and expression microarray was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL1319 [Zebrafish] Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array
