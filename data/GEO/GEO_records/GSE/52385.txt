TITLE
Next generation sequencing of the transcriptome in MCF-7 cells with/without SRA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed next generation sequencing to examine whether knocking down the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) gene significantly affect the expression levels of certain genes in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were transfected with either a pool of four non-target control siRNAs or a pool of four SRA siRNAs for 32 hrs. 157 million reads were generated from triplicate samples of the control group; 151 million reads were generated from triplicate samples of the SRA knockdown group. Six genes were identified as significantly changed in the expression levels with the cutoff of q value ≤ 0.05, fold change ≤ 0.5 or ≥ 2, and reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) ≥ 1. However, except for SRA itself, the other five genes were shown by real-time PCR to be only affected by one siRNA in the SRA siRNA pool. Further analysis of this dataset with different cuttoff setting may reveal true SRA-regulated genes in MCF-7.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM Glutamax-1, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool for human SRA (Thermo Scientific, L-027192-00-0005) was used to knockdown SRA (siSRA) and ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool Thermo Scientific, D-001810-10-05) was used as a negative control (siCtrl). A total of 25 nM siRNA was transfected in 6-well dishes using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX Reagent (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Polyadenylated RNA was purified from the cells 32 hrs after transfection. cDNA libraries were prepared and double-stranded cDNA was fragmented using DNase I according to Illumina specifications, prior to adaptor ligation. Sequencing libraries were amplified and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.
