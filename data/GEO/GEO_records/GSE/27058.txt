SUMMARY
Dr. Panjwani's laboratory is focusing on the mechanism by which galectins-3 and 7 mediate corneal epithelial cell migration. We are currently performing studies to: (i) identify and characterize the corneal epithelial cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules which serve as counterreceptors of galectin-3 and -7, to establish whether the lectins modulate corneal epithelial cell migration by binding to well known integrins, growth factor receptors, and/or ECM molecules and (ii) determine whether galectin-3 mediates corneal epithelial cell migration indirectly by modulating the expression of key adhesion and/or signal transduction molecules by using small interfering RNA, cDNA microarrays and glycogene arrays.
