TITLE
Emory_Pediatric_Strains_1

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Array CGH analysis of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from a North American cohort of symptomatic pediatric patients. Keywords: genotyping_design

DESIGN
A genotyping experiment design type classifies an individual or group of individuals on the basis of alleles, haplotypes, SNP's. Patients enrolled under Benjamin Gold's Emory IRB protocol. Initial strain isolation from antral biopsies performed at Emory and culture sweeps sent to FHCRC (Seattle) for analysis. Single colony isolates (4) from each patient antral biopsy were isolated and profiled using RAPD. A single clone of each RAPD type detected in each patient (1-2) were analyzed on duplicate arrays. For analysis 500 ng of genomic DNA of each test strain was labeled with Cy5 and 500 ng of genomic DNA of a reference sample (equimolar mix of 26695 and J99) was labeled with Cy3. Strains identified as Em-patient#-clone#.
