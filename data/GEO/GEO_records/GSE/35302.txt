TITLE
Total Gene expression analysis of H3f3b null and WT MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total gene expression analysis was performed on constitutive H3f3b KO E12.5 MEFs relative to WT littermates. Intent was to analyze the role of H3f3b in overall gene expression.

DESIGN
Constitutive KO mice were obtained by mating H3f3b Fl/Fl mice to Zp3Cre mice. Heterozygous offspring were time mated and embryos were isolated 12.5 days after. MEFs were cultured transduced with a stable pBabe puro vector and total RNA was isolated from H3f3b KO and WT MEFs.
