TITLE
Expression analysis in parthenogenetic cells through different potency stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parthenogenetic stem cells were derived from parthenotes, then differentiated to mesenchymal stem cells. These were further reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells, which were finally differentiated to secondary mesenchymal stem cells. Transcriptional analysis was performed at all 4 states of potency to indetify changes in expression stability of partehnogenetic cells.

DESIGN
4 samples for each stage of potency were analyzed, controls were biparental embryonic stem cells and their mesenchymal derivate, as well as biparental induced pluripotent stem cells
