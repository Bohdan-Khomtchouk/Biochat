TITLE
Detection of Treatment-Induced Changes in Signaling Pathways in GI Stromal Tumors using Transcriptomic Data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time series data from the GIST-T1 imatinib responsive cell line treated with imatinib mesylate for 0 - 48 hours.  The goal of this study was the development of methods to deduce global changes in cell signaling during treatment with targeted therapeutics.

DESIGN
26 samples, triplicate measurements at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 48 hrs of 10 microM IM treatment of GIST-T1 cells, duplicate measurements at 24 hr

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
