TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of tomato bZIP genes in various tissues

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We used Bio-Rad laboratories, lnc. PCR assay panel to analyze expression levels of bZIP genes in various tissues or organs. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. Suhong 2003 were reared in growth chambers at 24 ± 1 °C with a photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h dark and light intensity of 200 μE m2 s-1. The roots, stem,leaves,  flower, and fruits were collected from flowering plants for tissue expression analysis.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to gain insight into the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of 59 bZIP genes in tomato.
