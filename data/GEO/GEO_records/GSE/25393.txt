TITLE
Characterization of whole blood gene expression profiles of healthy miniature pigs with increasing age

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Studying the causes and correlations of individual or age variation in gene expression is necessary for securing  the reliability of the experimental animal. Feature of the blood gene expression of miniature pigs of fetus, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of age was examined.

DESIGN
Gene expression in male and female miniature pigs was measured at fetus, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of age.
