TITLE
Expression data from embryonic stem cells following siRNA transfection of UPS members [Differentiation_ES]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While transcriptional regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation has been extensively studied, only a small number of studies have addressed the roles for post-translational modifications in these processes.  A key mechanism of post-translational modification is ubiquitination by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Using UPS-targeted RNAi screens, we identify novel regulators of pluripotency and differentiation. We focus on two of these proteins, the deubiquitinating enzyme, Psmd14, and the E3 ligase, Fbxw7, and characterize their importance in ES cell pluripotency and cellular reprogramming.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cells were reverse transfected with siRNA, and differentiated for 48hrs in conditions with retinoic acid, 48 hrs post transfection cells were isloated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
