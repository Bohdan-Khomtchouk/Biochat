TITLE
Expression data of HepG2C3A treated by acetaminophen during 72 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of acetaminophen treatment on Hepatic cell line cultivated in conventionnal method and in a new cell culture device (microfluidic biochip) The aim of this study is to understand the transcriptomic responses of cells cultivated in a microsystem by comparison to conventionnal culture method. As a pharmacological example, we choose to used a well known hepatotoxicant : acetaminophen to illustrate the potential of our microsystem.

DESIGN
12 samples were analysed corresponding of 4 conditions : 3 replicates cell control in microsystem, 3 replicates cell treated in microsystem, 3 replicates cell control in Petri, 3 replicates cell treated in Petri cultivated during 96 hours including 72 hours of treatment

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
