TITLE
Global Transcriptome Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus Response to Hydrogen Peroxide

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, which involved initial growth inhibition and subsequent recovery. Keywords: Time course
