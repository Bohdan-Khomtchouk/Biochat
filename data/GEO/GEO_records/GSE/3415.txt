TITLE
Global Transcriptome Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus Response to Hydrogen Peroxide

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, which involved initial growth inhibition and subsequent recovery. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of hydrogen peroxide. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three hydrogen peroxide-treated (experimental) cultures for 10 and 20 min exposures.
