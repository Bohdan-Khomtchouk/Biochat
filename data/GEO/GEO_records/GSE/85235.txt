TITLE
Effects of black currant extract on gene expression on MCF10A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate new health functions by blackcurrant extract (BCE), we compare altered of the genes expression before and after BCE (50μg/ml) treatment in MCF10A.

DESIGN
MCF10A cells were seeded in culture dish and maintain to confluent. Then medium replace with  mammary epithelial cell growth medium kit with or without BCE (50μg/ml). After the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C 5% CO2.
