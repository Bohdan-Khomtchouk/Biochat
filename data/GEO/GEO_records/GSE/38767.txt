TITLE
Gene expression profiles in mouse common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and leukemia cells expressing full-length MN1 or truncated versions of MN1 protein

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to characterize gene expression profiles that were perturbed in common myeloid progenitor (CMP) cells due to enforced expression of full-length or truncated forms of MN1. Expression profiles of MN1-induced leukemias arising from whole bone marrow transduction were also compared with the profiles obtained from the CMP cells.

DESIGN
Lineage negative mouse bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing full-length or truncated MN1 proteins. After 2 days in culture, cells were FACS-sorted for GFP expression and cultured for a further 3 days in growth media. After 5 days total, RNA was isolated and processed for microarray analysis. RNA was also prepared for microarray analysis from leukemias arising in mice following whole bone marrow transduction with full-lenght MN1.
