TITLE
Identification of isobutanol response network of E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Isobutanol has emerged as a potential biofuel due to recent metabolic engineering efforts. Here we used gene expression and transcription factor(TF)-gene interaction data, genetic knockouts, and Network Component Analysis (NCA) to map the isobutanol response network of Escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. A transcriptional response network consisting of 2004 genes/TFs and 2600 interactions was identified. Through further investigation ArcA, Fur, and PhoB were demonstrated to be important mediators of this response. In addition, the ethanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol response networks were compared in order to identify common and distinct toxicity features associated with these three alcohol based biofuels.
