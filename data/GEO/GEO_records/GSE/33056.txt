TITLE
Expression data from polycystic kidney disease susceptible and resistant rat strains

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To facilitate the search for genetic modifiers that modulate ARPKD disease progression and severity, we sought to generate a congenic rat model that carries the PCK Pkhd1 mutation but is resistant to the development of ARPKD. We transferred the Pkhd1 mutation from the PCK rat onto the genetic background of the FHH (Fawn-Hooded Hypertensive) rat. This newly developed strain, called FHH.Pkhd1, showed significant amelioration of renal disease, and delayed onset of biliary abnormalities. To initiate the exploration for genes and pathways that modulate susceptibility to renal cystogenesis, we investigated transcriptional changes in kidneys from PCK, SD, FHH and FHH.Pkhd1 rats by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Both kidneys were harvested from 6 animals for each strain; SD, FHH, PCK, FHH.Pkhd1 (FHH.PCK-(D9Rat35-D9Rat70)/Mcwi, RGD ID 5147594) at 30 days of age.  The kidneys were bisected and stored in RNAlater at 4C for 24hrs. RNA was extracted using the Trizol (Invitrogen) method according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. RNA from each strain was pooled together, reverse transcribed, and hybridized to three Affymetrix Rat 230 arrays (Affymetrix).
