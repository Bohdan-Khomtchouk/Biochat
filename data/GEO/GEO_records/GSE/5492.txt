TITLE
Gene expression in the duodenum of sheep genetically resistant or susceptible to nematodes

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
This experiment compared gene expression in the duodenum of [1] weaned genetically resistant sheep and weaned genetically susceptible sheep (84 days old) [2] genetically resistant sheep and genetically susceptible sheep that have been naturally challenged once with nematodes (175 days old) and [3] genetically resistant sheep and genetically susceptible sheep that have been naturally challenged twice with nematodes (276 days old). Keywords: resistant v susceptible

DESIGN
At each time point (T = 84, 175, 276 days) a four factorial design was used with four resistant animals and four susceptible animals. Each animal in the resistant group was compared to each animal in the susceptible group incorporating dye swaps. At T = 84 the platform GPL4072 was used. At T = 175 days the platform GPL4076 was used and at T =276 days the platform GPL4077 was used.
