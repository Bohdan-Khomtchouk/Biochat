TITLE
HOTAIR transfected Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells were infected by retroviral expression with either VECTOR or HOTAIR.  To test the role of polycomb in HOTAIR mediated gene expression, MDA-MB-231 HOTAIR cells were infected with short hairpin retroviral vectors targeting SUZ12 or EZH2. A genetic modification design type is where an organism(s) has had genetic material removed, rearranged, mutagenized or added, such as knock out.
