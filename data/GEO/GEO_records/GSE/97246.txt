TITLE
Porcine oocytes maturation in vitro

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The proper mammalian oocytes maturation is recognized as reaching MII stage and accumulation of mRNA and proteins in cell cytoplasm following fertilization. The proper course of folliculogenesis and oogenesis is orchestrated with morphogenesis significantly influencing further zygote formation and embryos growth. This study was aimed to determinate new transcriptomic markers of porcine oocytes morphogenesis associated with cell maturation capacity. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying changes before and after in vitro maturation of oocytes in sus scrofa

DESIGN
Pig oocytes were aspired from porcine ovaries, selected to two groups by BCB test, subjected to in vitro maturation, RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Only oocytes of grade I with homogeneous ooplasm were considered for the following steps of the experiment, resulting 300 grade I oocytes (3 x n=50 before in vitro maturation, 3 x n=50 after In vitro maturation).
