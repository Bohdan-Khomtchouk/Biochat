TITLE
Interlocking transcriptomics, proteomics and toponomics technologies for brain tissue analysis in murine hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have correlated transciptomics, proteomics and toponomics analyses of hippocampus tissue of inbred C57/BL6 mice to analyse the interrelationship of expressed genes and proteins at different levels of organization. We find that transcriptome and proteome levels of function are highly conserved between different mice, while the topological organization (the toponome) of protein clusters in synapses of the hippocampus is highly individual, with only few interindividual overlaps (0.15 %). In striking contrast, the overall spatial patterns of individual synaptic states, defined by protein clusters, have boundaries within a strict and non-individual spatial frame of the total synaptic network. The findings are the first to provide insight in the systems biology of gene expression on transcriptome, proteome and toponome levels of function in the same brain subregion. The approach may lay the ground for designing studies of neurodegeneration in mouse models and human brains. Keywords: brain proteome, transcriptome, toponome, synapses
