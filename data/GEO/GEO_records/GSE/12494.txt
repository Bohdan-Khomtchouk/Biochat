SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma in advanced stages is among the most intractable pediatric cancers, even with the recent therapeutic advances. Neruroblastoma harbours a variety of genetic changes, including a high frequency of MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity in 1p36 and 11q, and gain of genetic material from 17q, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. However, the scarcity of reliable molecular targets has hampered the development of effective therapeutic agents targeting neuroblastoma. We performed a genome-wide analysis of a large number of neuroblastoma samples, consisting of varying disease stages, permitted us to obtain a comprehensive registry of genomic lesions in neuroblastoma.
