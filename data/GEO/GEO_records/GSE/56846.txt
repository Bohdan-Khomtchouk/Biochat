TITLE
PRPF6 regulated alternative splicing in colon cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PRPF6, an RNA binding component of the pre-mRNA spliceosome, is an essential driver of oncogenesis in colon cancer. PRPF6 is both amplified and overexpressed in colon cancer and cells with high PRPF6 levels are sensitive to its loss.  Here we investigate alternative splicing changes in colon cancer cell lines following PRPF6 silencing by three different siRNA sequences.

DESIGN
Two colon cancer cell lines (SW620 and KM-12), silencing of PRPF6 and control, 3 biological replicate samples for each group.

PLATFORM
