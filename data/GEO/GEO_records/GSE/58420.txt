TITLE
Next generation sequencing identifies differentially localized transcripts in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis oocytes

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis ; Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
RNA-seq technology was used to identify differentially localized transcripts from Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis stage VI oocytes. Besides the discovery of a group of novel animally enriched RNAs, this study revealed a surprisingly low conservation of vegetal RNA localization between the two frog species.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis animal and vegetal oocyte halves were generated by RNA-seq technology. For Xenopus laevis, animal and vegetal oocyte RNA preparations from two different females were generated in duplicates. For Xenopus tropicalis, animal and vegetal oocyte RNA preparations from two different females were analyzed.
