TITLE
Genes induced by partial down-regulation of ARID1A in breast cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of gene expression signatures for partial downreualtion of ARID1A protein.

DESIGN
ARID1A was down-regulated by si-RNA in a breast cancer cell, MDA-MB-157. Subsequently, RNAs was extracted from control siRNA treated cells or partially ARID1A-down regulated cells. cDNAs were synthesized and cRNAs were labeled using low input quick Amp labeling kit (Agilent). Aftere washing and dry, scanned by Agilent Technologies Micorarrray Scanner and calculated using Agilent Feature 10.7.3.1. control siRNA treated MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cells (MOK) and siRNA-midiated ARID1A-downregulated MDA-MB157 breast cancer cells.
