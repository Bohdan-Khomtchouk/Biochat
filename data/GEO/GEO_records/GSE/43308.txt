TITLE
Identification of in vivo, conserved, FUS RNA binding sites and the impact of FUS on the neuronal transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FUS, an RNA binding protein was recently implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. We report the identification of  the conserved neuronal RNA targets of FUS and the assessment of the impact of FUS depletion on the neuronal transcriptome. We identified that FUS regulates splicing of conserved intron containing transcripts. FUS retains or excludes the conserved intron by binding to them.

DESIGN
Identification of FUS neuronal targets using normal human brain samples and mouse neurons
