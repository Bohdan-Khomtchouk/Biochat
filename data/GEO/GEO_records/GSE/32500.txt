TITLE
Whole Genome Expression after Hypoxia and  Reoxygenation in the Newborn Mouse Lung, Brain and Eye

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Perinatal asphyxia is detrimental to the newborn baby and the use of supplemental oxygen during resuscitation may worsen the prognosis of these babies. The mechanism behind hyperoxic injury is not fully understood and our aim was to investigate four oxygen therapies following hypoxia and these effects on transcriptional activity.

DESIGN
A microarray study was performed on 62 C57BL/6 mice randomized into four hypoxia groups (FiO2 0.08, 120 min) reoxygenated with FiO2 0.21, 0.40, 0.60 and 1.0 (30 min), and into two normoxia groups (FiO2 0.21,120 min) reoxygenated with FiO2 0.21 or 1.0, which served as control groups. A 150 min observation time in normoxia followed before animal sacrificing and lung, brain and eye tissue were stored in RNA Later before the microarray analysis were performed.
