TITLE
eqtl-Identification of expression QTL of ABA response in sunflower

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_eqtl_sunflower - eqtl - Abiotic stress and more specifically drought is the major limiting factor for sunflower production. ABA is a key hormone for drought stress response in plants and sunflower. This experiment aims at identifying ABA responsive pathways in order to better understand sunflower responses to drought. The ultimate goal will be improve sunflower breeding through selection of key drought response genes. The experiment consisted of 1 or 2 (and 3 for the sample 209) repeats of 113 recombinant imbred lines and 11 repeats of the population parents SF1935 (INRA code XRQ), 11 SF326 (INRA code: PSC8) and the F1 hybrid 10 INEDI. The genotypes were grown in growth chamber conditions and submitted to a 6-hour-treatment of 0.5 µM absissic acid or not. Growth conditions were 14h light at 23°C and 10h night at 18°C under fluorescent bulbs. Plants were grown in 18 hydroponic boxes (9 for ABA treatment, 9 for control) containing 20 litres of aerated liquid culture medium (as described in Massonneau et al., 2001 Planta). Leaves (not cotyledons) from the 15-day-old-plantlets of sunflower were harvested 6 hours after treatment; the three repeats were pooled for each genotype and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.

DESIGN
236 arrays - SUNFLOWER; treated vs untreated comparison Grp suffixes such as -A, -AA, and bis, are there to differentiate the same replicates.
