TITLE
Prostate cell specific expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Luminal, basal, stromal, and endothelial cells were MACS sorted from whole tissue.  Targets from five biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.  These data represent cell specific transcriptomes. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
5 biological replicates for each sort were analyzed (20 chips)

PLATFORM
