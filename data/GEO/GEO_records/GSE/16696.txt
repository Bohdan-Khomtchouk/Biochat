TITLE
Smoking is Associated with Shortened Airway Cilia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Whereas cilia damage and reduced cilia beat frequency have been implicated as causative of reduced mucociliary clearance in smokers, theoretically mucociliary clearance could also be affected by cilia length. Based on models of mucociliary clearance predicting cilia length must exceed the 6 -7 Î¼m airway surface fluid depth to generate force in the mucus layer, we hypothesized cilia height may be decreased in airway epithelium of normal smokers compared to nonsmokers. Methodology/Principal Findings: Cilia length in normal nonsmokers and smokers was evaluated in aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded endobronchial biopsies, and air-dried and hydrated samples brushed from human airway epithelium via fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In 28 endobronchial biopsies, healthy smoker cilia length was reduced 15% compared to nonsmokers (p < 0.05). In 47 air-dried samples of airway epithelial cells, smoker cilia length was reduced 13% compared to nonsmokers (p < 0.0001). Analysis of the length of individual, detached cilia in 17 samples, smoker cilia length was reduced 9% compared to nonsmokers (p < 0.05). Finally, in 16 fully hydrated, unfixed samples, smoker cilia length was reduced 7% compared to nonsmokers (p < 0.05).

DESIGN
Conclusions/significance: Models predict that a reduction in cilia length would reduce mucociliary clearance, suggesting that smoking-associated shorter airway epithelial cilia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung disease.
