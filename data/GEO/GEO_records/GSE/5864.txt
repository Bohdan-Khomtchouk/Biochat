TITLE
Gene expression profiles in TNBS-induced murine colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the relationship between chronic inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic colitis.  Six weekly Trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) enemas were given to establish colitis and temporal changes in gene expression was elucidated over the next six weeks. Keywords: disease state analysis
