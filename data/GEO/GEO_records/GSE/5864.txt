TITLE
Gene expression profiles in TNBS-induced murine colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the relationship between chronic inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic colitis.  Six weekly Trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) enemas were given to establish colitis and temporal changes in gene expression was elucidated over the next six weeks. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
After the six TNBS enemas, mice were sacrificed at 3 days (termed as TNBS-w6, n=6), 2 weeks (TNBS-w8, n=4), 4 weeks (TNBS-w10, n=5), or 6 weeks (TNBS-w12, n=4). The saline control groups were also sacrificed at week 6 (Saline-w6, n=5), week 8 (n=2) and week 10 (n=2). The last two sets were pooled as Saline-w10 (n=4). Two replicates of saline-w6 were analyzed. We compared Saline-w6 with TNBS-w6, and Saline-w10 with TNBS-w8, TNBS-w10, TNBS-w12, respectively.
