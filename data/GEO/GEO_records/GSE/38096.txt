TITLE
Murine Testes: Germ Cell-Specific Sin3a Knockout vs. Hemizygous vs. Wild Type at Postnatal Day 0

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin modifier Swi-independent 3a (SIN3A), together with associated histone deacetylases, influences gene expression during development and differentiation through multiple transcription factors in a cell-specific manner. Sin3a is essential for the maintenance of inner cell mass cells of mouse blastocysts, embryonic fibroblasts, and myoblasts, but is not required for the survival of trophectoderm or Sertoli cells. To better understand how this transcriptional regulator modulates cells at different developmental stages within a single lineage, we used conditional gene targeting in mice to ablate Sin3a from perinatal quiescent male gonocytes and from postnatal differentiating spermatogonia.

DESIGN
Gene expression in the whole testes of age-matched Ddx4(Vasa/Mvh)-cre mediated conditional Sin3a gene-targeted(VSKO) mice, germ cell-specific Sin3a hemizygous (HEMI) mice, and wild type (WT) mice was measured at postnatal day 0. Two biological replicate animals were used for each condition.
