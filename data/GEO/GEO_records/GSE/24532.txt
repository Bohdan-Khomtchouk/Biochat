TITLE
B-type lamins differentially associate with specific genes during differentiation without directly affecting their expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B-type lamins, the major structural component of the nuclear lamina, is thought to play a repressive role in the expression of many of its bound genes whose silencing are known to be critical for cell differentiation during early development.  Using global mapping of lamin-B-chromatin interaction, we find that the binding to lamin-B indeed correlated with gene silencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and ESC-derived trophectoderm (TE) lineage cells.  To address whether lamin-B directly suppresses the expression of the bound genes, we have derived ESCs from lamin-B-null mouse blastocysts.  Unexpectedly, microarray analyses of ESCs and TE cells show that B-type lamins do not repress the expression of their bound genes.  Furthermore, the knockout mice that do not express any B-type lamins can develop to term but exhibit small body size and perinatal lethality.  Our studies demonstrate that B-type lamins are not required for cell differentiation during early embryonic development.  Instead, they are required for proper late embryonic and perinatal development.  The availability of the null ESCs and mice opens the door to further define the functions of B-type lamins.
