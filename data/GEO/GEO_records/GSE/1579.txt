TITLE
Conditional activation of B-catenin in adult mouse epidermis for 0, 1, or 7 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of deltaNB-cateninER allows the time and duration of B-catenin activation to be controlled precisely through the application of 4OHT.  We have shown that B-catenin activation in adult mouse epidermis stimulates de novo hair follicles and the formation of a new bulge and melanocyte niche.  We utilize Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays to investigate the differential regulation of RNA in skin from 7 week old female deltaNB-cateninER transgenic mice following 0, 1, or 7 days B-catenin activation in the epidermis.  RNA from age and sex matched wild-type littermates was used as a control.
