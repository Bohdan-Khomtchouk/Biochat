TITLE
Directional DNA methylation changes and complex intermediate states accompany lineage specificity in the adult hematopoietic compartment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation has been implicated as an epigenetic component of mechanisms that stabilize cell fate decisions. Here, we have characterized the methylomes of human female hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature cells from the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Hypomethylated regions (HMRs) associated with lineage-specific genes were often methylated in the opposing lineage. In HSPCs, these sites tended to show intermediate, complex patterns that resolve to uniformity upon differentiation, by increased or decreased methylation. Promoter HMRs shared across diverse cell-types typically display a constitutive core that expands and contracts in a lineage-specific manner to fine-tune the expression of associated genes. Many newly identified intergenic HMRs, both constitutive and lineage-specific, were enriched for factor binding sites with an implied role in genome organization and regulation of gene expression, respectively. Overall, our studies represent an important reference dataset and provide insights into directional changes in DNA methylation as cells adopt terminal fates.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from purified human peripheral blood cells was isolated, bisulfite converted and sequenced using the Illumina GA2 paltform
