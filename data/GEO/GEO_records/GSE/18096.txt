TITLE
Identifying the molecular signature of the t(12;14) subgroup of uterine leiomyomata using a paired analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uterine leiomyomata (UL), the most common neoplasm in reproductive age women, have recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities including t(12;14).  To develop a molecular signature, matched t(12;14) and non-t(12;14) tumors identified by FISH or karyotyping from each of 9 women were profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays.  Model analysis demonstrated the necessity for a matched design to eliminate the confounding effect of genotype and environment that underlay patient to patient variation.

DESIGN
Matched myometrium, t(12;14) fibroid tumors and non-t(12;14) fibroid tumors identified by FISH or karyotyping from each of 9 women were profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide gene expression arrays.
