TITLE
RNA Sequencing facilitates the identification of transcriptional targets of Pitx1 in Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The cement gland in Xenopus laevis has long been used as a model to study the interplay of cell signaling and transcription factors during embryogenesis. The homeodomain-containing transcription factor Pitx1 has been linked to cement gland development. However, the downstream transcriptional targets of Pitx1 remain unknown. Here, we utilize RNA Sequencing to identify transcripts whose expression are affected by Pitx1 misexpression in animal cap explants.

DESIGN
mRNA profile of pitx1-injected or control animal cap explants at neurula stages were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500 by Genewiz.

PLATFORM
GPL18936 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Xenopus laevis)
