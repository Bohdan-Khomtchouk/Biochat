TITLE
Gene expression of zebrafish testes after MCLR exposure

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the change of gene in zebrafish testes between the control and MCLR groups. zebraﬁsh were exposed to 20 μg/L MCLR for 6 weeks. Fresh testes tissue samples from 5 individuals were collected as one sample. Expression of three genes (hsp70, fgf1a and tgfβ1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the reliability of microarray analysis.

DESIGN
MCLR-induced gene expression in zebrafish testes was measured after exposure to doses of 20μg/L. for 6 weeks. Two independent experiments were performed at two groups (control and 20μg/L MCLR) for each experiment.
