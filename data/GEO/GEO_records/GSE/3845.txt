Role of NF-kB in aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To address the role of NF-kB in aging in vivo, we utilized a well-characterized system that allows inducible and site-specific inhibition of NF-kB activity in murine skin. The hormone binding domain of the mutant estrogen receptor that is responsive to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) was fused to a mutant of p50 (IDNkB, inducible dominant negative NF-kB) that dimerizes with other NF-kB subunits but is unable to bind DNA, thus dominantly inhibiting NF-kB activity. Expression was driven within the basal layer of murine epidermis by the keratin 14 promoter in transgenic mice. To test whether NF-kB activity is required to maintain age-associated gene expression, we applied topical 4-OHT and ethanol vehicle (EtOH) for two weeks to the right (R) and left (L) dorsal flanks, respectively, of chronologically aged transgenic mice (O, 18-23 months). Young transgenic mice (Y, 1 month) were treated in parallel as control. Skin samples were harvested and analyzed for gene expression using mouse cDNA microarrays containing 35,217 elements, representing 18,880 unique genes.
