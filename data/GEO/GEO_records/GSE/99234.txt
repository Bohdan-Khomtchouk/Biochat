TITLE
Expression data from D2.OR Derivatives

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BORG elicits the metastatic outgrowth of nonmetastatic breast cancer cells by promoting the localization and transcriptional repressive activity of TRIM28, which binds BORG and induces substantial alterations in carcinoma in the proliferation and survival We sought to assess genome-wide transcriptomic profiles governed by BORG in a TRIM28-dependent and -independent manner in latent D2.OR breast cancer cells

DESIGN
We propagated parental, BORG-, and BORG/sgTRIM28-expressing D2.OR cells in 3D-culture for 7 days, at which point total RNA was isolated and subsequently subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array analysis
