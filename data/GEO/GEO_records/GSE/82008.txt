TITLE
The effect of genetic and chemical inhibition of NF-kB subunits on the regulatory T cell (Treg) transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report here the transcriptome analysis on murine total, resting and activated Treg cells after chemical (using the drug pentoxifylline) and genetic (using conditional KO strain) inhibition of NF-kB.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing (30 million reads/sample) on : 1- Foxp3+ WT mouse Treg(treated with H2O or pentoxifylline), and c-Rel deficient Treg. 2-Foxp3+ CD62Lhi CD44lo rTreg and CD62Llo CD44hi aTreg sorted from WT, p65KO and cRelKO spleen+LN, ex vivo processed for RNA extraction. All experiments were performed in duplicates.

PLATFORM
