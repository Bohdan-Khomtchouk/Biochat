TITLE
Genomic mapping of ERG, AR, histone H3 monomethyl-K4, histone H3 trimethyl-K4 binding sites in mouse prostates in WT, ERG overexpression, Pten loss mouse prostates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translocation of ETS transcription factors including ERG and ETV1 occur in half of all prostate cancers. We generated a mouse model of ERG ovexpression (Rosa26-ERG) which when crossed into prostate specific probasin-Cre, expressed ERG specifically in the prostate. We crossed Rosa26-ERG into Pten flox/flox allele to generate compound GEMM mouse. Here, we determined the genomic binding sites of ERG, AR, and the histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 that maps enhancers and promoters respectively in the prostates of these mice.

DESIGN
The prostate of four six month old mice of each genotype were pooled. The chromatin was isolated and ChIP-Seq performed.
