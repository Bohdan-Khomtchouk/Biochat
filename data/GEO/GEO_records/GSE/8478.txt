TITLE
Genome-wide transcript analysis of Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids in soybean root nodules

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Expression data from B. japonicum soybean root nodules including  a nodulation time-course experiment with soybean nodules harvested at 10, 13, 21 and 31 dpi and transcriptome of bacteroids formed by a mutant defective in the RNA polymerase transcription factor sigma 54. Two reference data sets were established using B. japonicum cells grown in PSY medium under either aerobic or micro-aerobic conditions. Keywords: genetic modification, time course, growth conditions
