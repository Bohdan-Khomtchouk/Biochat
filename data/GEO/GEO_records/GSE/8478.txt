TITLE
Genome-wide transcript analysis of Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids in soybean root nodules

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum ; Glycine max

SUMMARY
Expression data from B. japonicum soybean root nodules including  a nodulation time-course experiment with soybean nodules harvested at 10, 13, 21 and 31 dpi and transcriptome of bacteroids formed by a mutant defective in the RNA polymerase transcription factor sigma 54. Two reference data sets were established using B. japonicum cells grown in PSY medium under either aerobic or micro-aerobic conditions. Keywords: genetic modification, time course, growth conditions

DESIGN
B. japonicum transcriptome was determined under free-living and symbiotic conditions including mutant analysis (sigma 54) and nodulation time-course experiments

PLATFORM
GPL3401 Affymetrix custom Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA 110 19K array
