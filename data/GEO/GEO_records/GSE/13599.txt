TITLE
NFkB dependent gene expression in a Mdr2-KO hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model using a IkB-Superrepressor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims on the identification of the NF-kB dependent gene regulatory network during inflammation-associated liver carcinogenesis using the well-established Mdr2 knockout mouse model. We could identify 367 differentially expressed genes comparing expression profiles of tumor samples from Mdr2-KO mice to tumor samples derived from mice with an additional hepatocyte specific expression of an IkB-superrepressor. This IkB-superrepresser is undegradable upon ubiquitinylation initialized by Ikk dependent phosphorylation and therefore impedes NFkB activity. Keywords: NFkB, IkB-superrepressor, inflammation-associated liver carcinogenesis, Mdr2-KO mouse model, hepatocellular carcinoma, gene expression, microarray
