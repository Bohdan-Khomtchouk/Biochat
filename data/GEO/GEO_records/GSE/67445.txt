TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis under arginine conditions

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
In other bacteria, arginine induces the expression of genes involved in arginine catabolism. This study obtained the identification of genes involved in the arginine metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured with arginine or ammonium chloride as sole nitrogen source. In the log phase of growth, RNA was isolated and whole genome expression was determined. The study contains three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7477 HCI Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv 5.5K [MTbH37Rva520456F]
