TITLE
The gene expression profiles in response to fungal infection in hemocytes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The object of the microarray data is to find several genes effected by fungal infection. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
In order to establish the gene expressino levels in response to fungal infection in hemocytes, B.bassiana were injected into the posterior end of third instar larvae using a tungsten needle and incubated for 1h at 25 celcius degree. To compare with non-infected hemocytes, total RNA from infected hemocytes were labeled by Cy5, total RNA from non-infected hemocytes were labeled by Cy3, and hybridized to chip.
