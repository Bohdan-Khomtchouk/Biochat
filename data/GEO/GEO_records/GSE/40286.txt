TITLE
The Mediator MED23 plays opposing roles in directing smooth muscle cell and adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined how MED23 regulates SRF-targeted genes by comparing WT and Med23 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in the presence or absence of serum-stimulation (for 30 and 90 min). To investigate whether MAL antagonizes MED23 in the adipocyte lineage program, we compared the gene expression changes resulting from Mal overexpression (oxMal) and Med23 deficiency (siMed23) in 10T1/2 cell.

DESIGN
In MEF cells, we examined SRF-dependent gene expression in three time points (0, 30, 90min) and two conditions (WT and KO). In 10T1/2 cells, we used three treatment conditions (Mal overexpression, Med23 knockdown, and treatment of both Mal overexpression and Med23 knockdown) with control (no treatment).
