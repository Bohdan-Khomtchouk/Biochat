TITLE
ChIP-Seq of gamma-H2Av bound to third instar salivary gland DNA in WT and SuUR mutant Drosophila; ChIP-Seq of SUUR and Cdc45 bound to egg chamber DNA from early and late stage egg chambers

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed gamma-H2Av ChIP-Seq from hand dissected salivary glands of wandering third instar larvae from wild-type (OrR) or suppressor of under-replication (SuUR) mutant Drosophila. Goals were to determine the DNA damage profile relative to underreplicated domains. We analyzed SUUR and Cdc45 ChIP-Seq from hand dissected early (stage 10) and late (stage 12/13) egg chambers from adult Drosophila ovaries. The goals was to determine the localization of SUUR relative to replication forks.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of gamma-H2Av bound to third instar salivary gland DNA in WT and SuUR mutant Drosophila, analyzed by Illumina sequencing. One replicate is included for each of OrR (WT) or SuUR salivary glands.Rabbit IgG controls are included for OrR (WT). ChIP-Seq of SUUR and Cdc45 bound to egg chamber DNA from early and late stage egg chambers, analyzed by Illumina sequencing. One replicate is included for each ChIP reaction.
