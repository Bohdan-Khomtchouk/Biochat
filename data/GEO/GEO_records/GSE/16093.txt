TITLE
Generation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Direct Delivery of Reprogramming Proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To date, all methods to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells require the use of genetic materials and/or potentially mutagenic chemicals. Here we report the generation of stable human iPS cells from human fibroblasts by directly delivering defined reprogramming proteins. This system eliminates the potential risks associated with genetic and/or chemical manipulation, and could provide a safe and physiologically intact source of cells for regenerative medicine.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were prepared from human fibroblasts, H9, and hiPS lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Expression Array U133 Plus 2.0 analyzing over 47,000 human transcripts at the Harvard Partners Center for Genomics and Genetics.
