TITLE
Gene expression profiling of blood in hidradenitis suppurativa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To acquire a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), we performed mRNA microarray studies to compare whole blood gene expression of HS patients to that of healthy normal subjects. No significant difference was observed in whole blood mRNA expression between HS patients and healthy normal control.

DESIGN
Whole blood samples were collected from patients with hidradenitis (n=16) at baseline and healthy normal subjects (n=10) for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
