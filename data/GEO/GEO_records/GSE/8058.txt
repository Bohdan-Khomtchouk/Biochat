TITLE
Wildtype (N2) C. elegans: Control vs. 10mM LiCl treated for 48hr at 25oC

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adult C. elegans comparing control untreated  with populations exposed to 10mM LiCl.  Populations treated from larval stage L4  for 48hr at 25oC.  10mM LiCl contained in the Nematode Growth Media (NGM) Keywords: Drug treatment

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. 10mM LiCl treated populations. Biological replicates: 6 control, 6 LiCl treated, independently grown and harvested. All samples compared against common reference total RNA from mixed stage wildtype (N2) worms. One replicate per array.
