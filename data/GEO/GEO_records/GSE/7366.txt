TITLE
Validation of gene expression from rice locus (self-hybridization)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcription from 23K TIGR–loci were confirmed by full–length cDNA mapping, but other 33K TIGR–loci were not confirmed. However, it was not natural to think that full–length cDNA libraries was included almost rice genes, because the transcription of 3K CDS–ANE were confirmed by other transcriptome resources in TIGR OSA1. So, for detection of gene expression from FL–locus and TIGR–locus, we designed about 82K 60mer oligo probes based on TIGR Pseudomolecules release 2. However, TIGR–locus was revised according to revised Pseudomolecules and other additional transcriptome resources. Therefore designed 82K probes were re-mapped on TIGR4 ,and 63455 probes were mapped on 43090 locus Keywords: tissue type comparison

DESIGN
organisms = Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (Nipponbare), and indica (IR64) tissues = shoot, root, panicle, callus hybridization = two dye method hybridization = self hybridization replication = two times

PLATFORM
GPL5033 Whole rice locus 44K array 1 GPL5036 Whole rice locus 44K array 2
