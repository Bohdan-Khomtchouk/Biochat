TITLE
expression data from 14 tissues of maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The genes specifically express in some tissue may usually play an important role in the development of the tissue. At vegetative growth stage, some genes may up-regulated to promote the nutrition absorbtion and transportation. However during the reproductive stage, some genes may up-regulated to regulate the flowering and seed development. We used microarrays to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between seed and non-seed tissues.

DESIGN
Different tissues of maize were selected at vegetative growth stage and reproductive stage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between seed and non-seed tissues. To that end, Big trumpet period maize inbred line B73 was use to collect nutritive tissues include root, stem, stem tip and leaf; 10, 15, 20 and 25 DAP (days after pollination) embryo and endosperm; ear and silk before pollination. Each sample has three replications.
