TITLE
Retinoic acid signaling is essential for HSC development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find signaling regulators that modulate transition from endothelial (AA4.1/VEC+CD45-) to hemogenic endothelial (AA4.1/VEC+ CD45+) cell

DESIGN
This microarray was performed between  AA4.1/VEC single +ve or AA4.1/VECCD45+ cells were sorted from E11.5 AGM and Total RNA was extracted.
