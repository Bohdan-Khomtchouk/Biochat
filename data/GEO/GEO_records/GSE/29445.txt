TITLE
Effect of telmisartan on prostate carcinogenesis in TRAP rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We investigate the direct effects of ARBs on prostate cancer growth and progression.

DESIGN
A total of 36 heterozygous male TRAP rats of 3 weeks of age were randomly divided into three groups. Rats in group 1 as a control received basal diet and tap water. The rats in groups 2 and 3 continuously received 2 or 10 mg/kg/day telmisartan in drinking water for 12 weeks, respectively. Total RNAs of both control and telmisartan (10 mg/kg/day) were applied to microarray analysis.
