TITLE
Gene expression profile in melanomas from Pdk1-inactivated BrafV600E::Pten-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed to access the changes in gene expression in melanomas from Pdk1-inactivated Brafv600E::Pten-/- mice.  The expression profiles of the BrafV600E::Pten-/-::Pdk1-/- were compared to the BrafV600E::Pten-/-::Pdk+/+ genotypes.  The analysis has identified several important signaling pathways in Pdk1-dependent melanomagenesis.

DESIGN
Melanoma tumors from the BrafV600E::Pten-/-::Pdk1+/+ and BrafV600E::Pten-/-::Pdk1-/- genotypes were harvested and mRNA from each group was pooled to enable four biologically replicates analysis.
