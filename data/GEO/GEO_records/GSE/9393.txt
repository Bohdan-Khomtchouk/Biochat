TITLE
Looking for mitochondrial associated RNA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the peripheral mitochondrial localization of nuclear-encoded mRNAs (MLR) in various conditions in which translation was inhibited or the mRNA binding protein context altered (Delta puf3). We used cell fractionation protocols together with microarray to assess the distribution of mRNAs between free and mitochondrion-bound polysomes. Keywords: Mitochondrial-associated RNA localization in cells

DESIGN
GSM239122-GSM239127: mitochondrial associated RNA (three biological replicates each in dye swap) GSM239128-GSM239131: mitochondrial associated RNA in presence of 200Âµg/ml cycloheximide (two biological replicates each in dye swap) GSM239132-GSM239135: mitochondrial associated RNA in presence of 2.1mM puromycin (two biological replicates each in dye swap) GSM239136-GSM239139: mitochondrial associated RNA in Delta Puf3 strain (two biological replicates each in dye swap)
