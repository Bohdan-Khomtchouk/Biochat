SUMMARY
Regulation of presenilin genes. Presenilins are intramembrane aspartic proteases. These proteases are critical proteins in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The function of recently identified presenilin-homologous proteases (IMPAS or SPP)s is unknown. Our preliminary data in C.elegans model suggested the role of these proteins in early-development and , perhaps, in pathway related- to cholesterol -regulated signalling (Grigorenko et al, 2004, PNAS). The overall goal is to determine pattern of gene expression alterations in cells with knock-out or knock-down presenilin related proteins (IMPAS). The cultured cells,    C.elegans and mouse models are planned to be used in this study. Initially, we will determine gene expression patterns in human  cells  embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cell line) overexpressing different isoforms of hIMP1 protein. We hypothesize that novel family of presenilin-related proteases is important for cholesterol-regulated intracellular signalling and early  development (including CNS/neuronal development and function). We will examine in HEK 293 cells effect of over expression of 1) hIMP1 wt protein, 2) over expression of dominant negative isoform of hIMP1 protein  and compare their gene expression patterns to 3) HEK 293 cells treated with mock vector. HEK 293 cells were seeded on 10 cm plates and transfected next day using Lipofectamine Plus reagent. 24 hours after cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS buffer and lysed with TRizol reagent directly on plates. Total RNA was extracted, purified according the manufacturer protocol and stored at -800C. We will provide 2 RNA samples for each hIMP1 isoform used in two different transfection experiment to reduce any spurious expression differences resulting from culture condition or transfection efficiency variations.
