TITLE
Identification of transcription factor Srf binding sites and histone 3 actetylated regions in mouse cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the cardiac transcription network driven by the DNA-binding key factor Srf in combination with epigenetic marks of histone 3 acetylation (H3ac). Srf has been shown to play a key role in cardiac cell growth and muscle gene regulation. However, we still have limited understanding of the global transcription network driven by this factor in a direct or indirect manner. Moreover, we lack knowledge to which extent epigenetic marks such as histone modifications interfere with the regulation of direct targets. To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory network two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) samples were profiled. DNA fragments bound to Srf or modified with acetylated histone 3 in mouse cardiomyocytes (HL1-cells) were sequenced using ultra-high throughput DNA sequencing.
