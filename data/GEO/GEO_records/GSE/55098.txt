TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell in patients with type 1 diabetes  compared with normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease mediated by autoimmune attack against pancreatic b  cells.Dys-regualtion of the component of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including T-cells and B-cells, and smaller amounts of NK cells and dendritic cells, have all been implicated in this process This study sought to identify T1D associated differently expressed  genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC).

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear of newly diagnosed type1 diabetes patients and normal controls were purified by LymphoprepTm gradient purification according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) for futher microarray analysis.
