TITLE
A study of Mediator subunit enhancer-promoter binding

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mediator is a transcriptional co-activator recruited to enhancers by DNA-binding activators, and it also interacts with RNA polymerase (Pol) II as part of the preinitiation complex (PIC).  We demonstrate that a single Mediator complex associates with the enhancer and core promoter in vivo, indicating that it can physically bridge these transcriptional elements.  However, the Mediator kinase module associates strongly with the enhancer, but not with the core promoter, and it dissociates from the enhancer upon depletion of the TFIIH kinase.  Severing the kinase module from Mediator by removing the connecting subunit Med13 does not affect Mediator association at the core promoter, but increases occupancy at enhancers.  Thus, Mediator undergoes a compositional change in which the kinase module, recruited via Mediator to the enhancer, dissociates from Mediator to permit association with Pol II and the PIC.  As such, Mediator acts as a dynamic bridge between the enhancer and core promoter.

DESIGN
8 Mediator subunits' genome-wide binding is tested by Chip-seq before and after Kin28 anchor-away.
