TITLE
m1A marks translation initiation sites in human and mouse messenger RNA [Sequencing]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach, m1A-seq, for high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome-wide m1A landscape, based on antibody-mediated capture followed by massively parallel sequencing

DESIGN
Identification of m1A modified sequences in human, mouse and yeast cell lines
