TITLE
5-hydroxymethylcytosine: the sixth DNA base

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a meta analysis of publicly available TET1, 5mC, 5hmC and genome wide bisulfite profiling data mostly from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). Genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) has revealed binding of the TET1 protein at CpG-island (CGI) promoters and at bivalent promoters. We show that TET1 also coincides with DNAseI hypersensitive sites (HS). Presence of TET1 at these THREE locations suggests that it may play a dual role: an active role at CpG-islands and DNAseI hypersensitive sites and a repressive role at bivalent loci. In line with the presence of TET1, significant enrichment of 5hmC but not 5mC is detected at bivalent promoters and DNaseI HS. Surprisingly, 5hmC is not detected or present at very low levels at CGI promoters notwithstanding the presence of TET1 at these loci. Our meta analysis suggest that asymmetric methylation is present at CA- and CT-repeats in the genome of some human ESC.

DESIGN
Examination of the distribution of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells.
