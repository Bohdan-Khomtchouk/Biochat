TITLE
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus attack phase and Host-Independent grown cells

ORGANISM
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus

SUMMARY
Bdellovibrio is a Gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other Gram-negative bacteria, including many pathogens, and as such has potential as a biocontrol agent. Little is known of the molecular and genetic control of Bdellovibrio’s attack upon its prey and of the nature of the HI phenotype. Here, we apply microarray technology to monitor changes of gene expression during the initial stages of prey infection to determine which predatory genes are important in this stage and to gain insight into possible regulatory mechanisms controlling the predation process. Comparison to gene expression during HI growth reveals a “predatosome” of genes specifically upregulated during predation and implicates some of those important in HI growth.

DESIGN
3 replicates of attack phase cells and 3 replicates of Host-Independent grown cells were analysed on individual arrays.
