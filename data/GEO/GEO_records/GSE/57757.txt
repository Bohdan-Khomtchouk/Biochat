TITLE
Expression profiles of sorted murine lung Eosinophils following allergen challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The eosinophil transcriptome analysis indicated a robust transcription change in eosinophils following allergen challenge in the lung.

DESIGN
Eosinophils were FACS-sorted from Saline or OVA challenged lung with high purity and then subjected to genome-wide RNA microarray
