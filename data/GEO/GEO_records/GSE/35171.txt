TITLE
Effect of VEGF on expressions of C2H2 zinc finger proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenic homeostasis is maintained by a balance between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Notch signalling in endothelial cells (ECs). We screened for molecules that might mediate the coupling of VEGF signal transduction with down-regulation of Notch signalling, and identified B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma6-associated zinc finger protein (BAZF). BAZF was induced by VEGF-A in ECs to bind to the Notch signalling factor CBF1, and to promote the degradation of CBF1 through polyubiquitination in a CBF1-cullin3 (CUL3) E3 ligase complex. BAZF disruption in vivo decreased endothelial tip cell number and filopodia protrusion, and markedly abrogated vascular plexus formation in the mouse retina, overlapping the retinal phenotype seen in response to Notch activation. Further, impaired angiogenesis and capillary remodeling were observed in skin-wounded BAZF-/- mice. We therefore propose that BAZF supports angiogenic sprouting via BAZF-CUL3-based polyubiquitination-dependent degradation of CBF1 to down-regulate Notch signalling.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with recombinant human VEGF165 for 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours.
