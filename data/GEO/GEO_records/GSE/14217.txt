TITLE
Synthetic Lethality (SLAM) Project Data

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Synthetic lethality is a type of genetic interaction in which two non-lethal mutations acting together result in a loss of viability. Such interactions are important for the insights they may offer into how gene functions are organized into distinct cellular processes. The datasets in this Series represent an effort to identify synthetic lethal genetic interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a genome-wide scale.
