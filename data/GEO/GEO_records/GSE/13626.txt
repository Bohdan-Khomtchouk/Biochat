TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in melanoma of wild-type and VAP-1 -/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial cell-surface protein. It is also an enzyme posessing semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity (EC.1.4.3.6). VAP-1 is involved in leukocyte traffic. To study the role of VAP-1 in tumor immunity, we compared gene expression profiles in melanomas growing in VAP-1 -/- mice and their wid-type littermates.

DESIGN
The B16-F10-Luc-G5 melanoma cells (Xenogen) were injected subcutaneously into abdominal area of 2 wild-type and 2 VAP-1 -/- mice. Tumors were grown until day 10 when mice were euthanized. Tumors were dissected and total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit.
