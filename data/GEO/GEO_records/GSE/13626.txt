TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in melanoma of wild-type and VAP-1 -/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial cell-surface protein. It is also an enzyme posessing semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity (EC.1.4.3.6). VAP-1 is involved in leukocyte traffic. To study the role of VAP-1 in tumor immunity, we compared gene expression profiles in melanomas growing in VAP-1 -/- mice and their wid-type littermates.
