TITLE
Molecular Profiles Associated with Calcineurin Inhibitor Toxicity Post-Kidney Transplant: Input to Chronic Allograft Dysfunction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular basis of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (CNIT) in kidney transplantation (KT) and its contribution to chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) with interstitial fibrosis (IF) and tubular atrophy (TA) were evaluated. Molecular signatures characterizing CNIT samples were identified.  The recognized CNIT gene signature was most common in patients with decreased graft function and histological evidence of IF/TA.

DESIGN
To test CNIT contribution to CAD progression, kidney biopsies from transplant recipients with histological diagnosis of CNIT (n=14), acute rejection (ACR, n=13), and CAD with IF/TA (n=10), including 18 Normal allografts, were analyzed using gene expression microarrays.
