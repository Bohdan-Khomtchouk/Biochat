TITLE
Effect of NIK overexpression on Foxp3+CD4+ and Foxp3-CD4+ T cell subsets [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously found that NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK) overexpression in T cells via CD4 promoter driven transgene induction caused lethal autoimmunity in mice. Autoimmunity was associated with increased conventional T cell effector function and decreased regulatory T cell (Foxp3+CD4+) suppression. The goal in this study was to elucidate global transcriptional changes in Foxp3+CD4+ and Foxp3-CD4+ T cells intrinsically caused by chronic NIK overexpression in these cell types. Total RNA from FACS-sorted NIKtg and WT Foxp3RFP+CD4+ and Foxp3RFP-CD4+ harvested from NIKtg/CD4Cre/Foxp3RFP + WT/Thy1.1/Foxp3RFP mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, > 8 weeks after bone marrow reconstitution.
