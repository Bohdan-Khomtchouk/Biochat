TITLE
Episomal S/MAR-based replicons do not alter expression profile of host genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methods: mRNA profiles of untransfected HeLa cells (wild-type; wt) were compared with mRNA profiles of HeLa cells stably maintaining an S/MAR-based episome. Results: We here report for the first time that episomally maintained S/MAR-based vectors do not alter gene expression profile of the host cell's genome. No global changes in gene expression in episome maintaining cells, compared to non-transfected cells could be observed. To identify differentially expressed genes, false discovery rate (FDR; q-value) cut off was set to 0.01. Significantly differentially expressed genes with q < 0.01 and an absolute fold-change of 2 were not detected. For verification, we chose five genes with high fold-change and low q-values (q < 0.05) and compared expression levels between untransfected HeLa and HeLa stably maintaining an S/MAR-based within three replicates in qPCR. Conclusions: S/MAR-based replicons used in this study do not code for viral proteins but tend to co-localise with promoter sequences and transcription start sites. Recent observations that cooperatively transcribed promoters can influence each other raise concerns that S/MAR-based replicons have the potential to alter endogenous gene expression. Therefore, we compared the transcriptome of untransfected HeLa cells with HeLa cells stably maintaining an S/MAR-based episome. Setting the FDR to < 0.01, we found no significantly differentially expressed genes. This finding is of utmost importance for potential gene therapeutic application of S/MAR-based replicons.
