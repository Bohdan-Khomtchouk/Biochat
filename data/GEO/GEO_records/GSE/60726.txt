TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in mouse plasma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the mouse plasma after ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the plasma from three mouse after IRI and identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs.
