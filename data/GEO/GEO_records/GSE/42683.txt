TITLE
Expression analysis of genes affected by dehydration-responsive transcription factor Os02g31890 from rice.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Os02g31890 encodes a dehydration-responsive transcription factor (named ´ARID´) from rice (Oryza sativa, cv. Dongjin). Expression profiling was performed 90 min after the start of dehydration stress in roots of Oryza sativa wild-type plants (cv. Dongjin) and a knock-out (i.e. arid) mutant.

DESIGN
Wild-type rice plants and a line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the third exon of the transcription factor gene (arid mutant) were subjected to dehydration stress for 90 min. Well-watered wild-type and T-DNA insertion plants were used as controls. Total RNA was extracted from roots and subjected to expression profiling using rice Affymetrix microarrays.
