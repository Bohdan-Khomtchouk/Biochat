TITLE
The impact of a drug transporter ABCG2 haplotype in molecular response of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients is modulated by imatinib dose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug transporter genes on the molecular response to imatinib, using 857 SNPs covering 94 drug transporter genes on 355 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients.

DESIGN
Samples were analyzed with respect to sex, imatinib daily dose, SOKAL score and the levels of molecular responses. The 'characteristics: molecular response' values represent the ratio BCR-ABL/ABL*100, which is determined by RT-QPCR (real time quantitative PCR). It is the percentage of the number of copies of BCR-ABL transcript on the number of ABL transcript copies.
