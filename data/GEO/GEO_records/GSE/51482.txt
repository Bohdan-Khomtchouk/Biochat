TITLE
NCOA3 upregulates MUC4 and MUC1 transcriptionally and through post-translational stability during pancreatic cancer development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stable knock down of NCOA3 in PC cell lines resulted in significant downregulation of the two most differentially expressed MUCs in PC, MUC4 and MUC1. NCOA3 creates pro-inflammatory conditions by up-regulating chemokines like CXCL1, 2, 5 and CCL20

DESIGN
Stable Knock down of NCOA3 in CD18/HPAF cell line. RNA was isolated from control and stably transfected cells. Each group has three biological replicate.
