TITLE
Comparison of miRNA profile of activated T cells to naive T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cells were activated for 1, 3 or 10 days using plate-bound anti-TCR and anti-CD28. Low molecular weight RNA from conventional T cells and activated T cells was hybridised to microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes corresponding to known miRNA sequences. Keywords: cell state analysis

DESIGN
Five arrays, with T cells having been activated for varying lengths of time, including dye swaps.
