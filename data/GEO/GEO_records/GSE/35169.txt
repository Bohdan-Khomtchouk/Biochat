TITLE
Expression data from U87 glioma cells and U87-2M1 glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An experimental lung metastasis assay was used to derive an invasive subline of U87 that is metastatic in mice. We used microarray analyses to find out over-represented gene ontologies that can explain the observed enhanced invasiveness of U87-2M1 cells.

DESIGN
Early passage U87-2M1 cells and parental U87 glioma cells from ATCC were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on microarray
