TITLE
Dynamic transcriptional response of Microcoleus vaginatus to hydration and dehydration in a desert biological soil crust

ORGANISM
Microcoleus vaginatus PCC 9802

SUMMARY
Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are cyanobacteria-dominated microbial communities that cover extensive portions of the worldâ€™s arid and semi-arid deserts. The infrequent periods of hydration are often too short to allow for dormancy strategies based on sporulation; consequently, survival is based on the unique capabilities of vegetative cells to resuscitate from and re-enter a stress resistant dormant state, one of which is migration within the crust layers in response to hydration. In this study, we sought to characterize the events that govern the emergence of the dominant cyanobacterium from dormancy, its subsequent growth, and the events triggered by re-desiccation and a transition back to dormant state. We performed a 48 hour laboratory wetting experiment of a desert BSC and tracked the response of Microcoleus vaginatus using a whole genome transcriptional time-course including night/day periods. This allowed the identification of genes with a diel expression pattern, genes involved uniquely in the signaling after hydration and those that contribute primarily to desiccation preparation.
