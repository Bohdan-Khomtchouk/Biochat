TITLE
Identification of KAT6B signature on KAT6B deficient SCLC cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To develop our gene expression experiment, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes potentially regulated by the transcriptional coactivator KAT6B. Expression of KAT6B gene was downregulated in two human SCLC cell lines using two different short hairpin RNAs. RNAs from these modified cell lines were hybridized in Agilent platform.

DESIGN
2 different SCLC cell lines transfected with 2 different shRNAs and 2 different Scramble plasmids. All shRNAs and Scramble samples were hybridized in Agilent platform in order to look for differentially expressed genes.

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
