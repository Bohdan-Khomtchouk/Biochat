ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_971 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Kevin White. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: The White Lab is aiming to map the association of the main post-translationally modified histones on the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. One technique that we use for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays. The data generated by ChIP-chip experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested histone modification. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and CHIP-chip
