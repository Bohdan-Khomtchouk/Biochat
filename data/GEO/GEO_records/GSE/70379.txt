TITLE
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) Alters Lipid Metabolism and Depletes Immune Cell Populations in the Jejunum of C57BL/6 Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dose-dependent jejunal epithelial gene expression was examined following repeated exposure (every 4 days for 28 days) to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). These data were used to examine the effect of repeated TCDD exposure on jejunal differential gene expression, in order to investigate the role of the jejunum in TCDD-elicited steatohepatitis in C57BL/6.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for each dose (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30) of TCDD and sesame oil vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
