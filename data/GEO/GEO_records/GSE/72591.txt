TITLE
Time-dependent global gene expression profile of J774A.1 cells treated with ManLAM in the absence or presence of GW9662

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of J7774A.1  cells treated with ManLAM ( 5ug/ml) for 6 h in the absence or presence of GW9662

DESIGN
J774A.1 cells were treated wit ManLAM either in the absence or presence of GW9662 for 6 h followed by total RNA isolation. Total RNA was labelled with Agilentâ€™s quick-Amp labelling kit (p/n: 5190-0444) to generate fluorescent complementary RNA by using T7 promoter based linear amplification. The control sample was labelled with Cy3 while the infected samples were labelled with Cy5 and hybridized to an  Agilent oligo microarray kit.
