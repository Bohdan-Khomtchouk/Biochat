TITLE
Sporadic vs. Post-Chernobyl Papillary vs. Anaplastic Thyroid Cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the gene expression of anaplastic thyroid cancers of Belgian patients. We compared these with the expression profile of a cohort of papillary thyroid tumors both from the Chernobyl Tissues Bank (CTB) and French patients with no history of exposure to radiations, along with their patient-matched healthy adjacent thyroid.

DESIGN
A group of nine anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs), together with twenty papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) paired with their respective adjacent tissues (N), were hybridized onto Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. PTCs were obtained from the Ambroise Paré Hospital (Boulogne, France; sporadic PTC, n=10) and from the Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB, www.chernobyltissuebank.com) (post-Chernobyl PTC, n=10). ATCs were obtained from the Jules Bordet Institute (Brussels) and the Ambroise Paré Hospital (France).
