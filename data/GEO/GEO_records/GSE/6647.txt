Expression analysis of edc3 cell

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to identify transcripts regulated by Edc3p, an activator of mRNA decapping. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Five independent expression profiling experiments were carried out for isogenic wild-type (HFY114) and edc3Î” (SYY14) strains using Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 Arrays.
