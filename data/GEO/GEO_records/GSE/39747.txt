TITLE
Identification of a radiosensitive gene signature in gastric cancer cells using microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prediction of response prior to radiotherapy is future direction of radiotherapy and identification of druggable targets in radiotherapy could overcome resistance. In order to identify a radiosensitive gene signature and elucidate relevant signaling pathways, microarrays using gastric cancer cells were analyzed before radiotherapy

DESIGN
Oligonucleotide microarray was performed using twelve gastric cancer cells and a human oligo chip containing 22,740 oligonucleotide probes before radiation.
