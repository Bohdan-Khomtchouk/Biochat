TITLE
SM015 - Infection with SARS MA15 of C57BL/6J mice and Tnfrsf1a/1b knockouts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing the host response of C57BL/6J mice to Tnfrsf1a/1b knockouts in the same strain of mice.

DESIGN
Groups of 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice or Tnfrsf1a/1b knockout mice were infected with SARS MA15 at a dose of 10^5 PFU or mock infected. Mice were euthanized on days 4 and 7 post-infection to measure virus load and isolate samples for measurement of virus load, lung pathology, transcriptional analysis and proteomics analysis. Mock-infected animals were also harvested at each time point. Mice were weighed every 24 hours to measure general disease progression and any mouse approaching 30% weight loss was euthanized.
