TITLE
The IclR-family regulator BapR controls biofilms formation in B. cenocepacia H111

ORGANISM
Burkholderia cenocepacia H111

SUMMARY
In Burkholderia cenocepacia H111, the large surface protein BapA plays a crucial role in the formation of highly structured communities, known as biofilms. We have recently demonstrated that Quorum sensing (QS) is necessary for the maximal expression of bapA. In this study we identify a protein from the IclR family of transcriptional regulators that, in conjunction with QS, controls biofilm formation by affecting the expression of bapA. We present evidence that, in addition to BapA,  BapR influences the expression of extracellular protease, swimming motility and has a profound impact in the abundance of persister cells, making this regulator an interesting target for persister and biofilm eradication.

DESIGN
Identification of a new regulator BapR controlling biofilm formation
