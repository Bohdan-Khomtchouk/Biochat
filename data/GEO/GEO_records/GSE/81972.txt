TITLE
Determination of the RNA linked to the paraspeckle in the GH4C1 cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the identity of the RNA linked to the paraspeckles in the rat GH4C1 cell line.

DESIGN
GH4C1 cell were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Then nuclei were purified, lysed and sonicated. RNA pull-down was performed using two antisense DNA biotinylated oligonucleotide probes that target the lncRNA Neat1. Streptavidin-magnetic beads were added to hybridization reaction and complexes were captured by magnets. RNA was isolated using NucleoSpinÂ®RNA XS (Macherey-Nagel).
