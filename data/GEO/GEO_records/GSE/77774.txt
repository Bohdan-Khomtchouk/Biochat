TITLE
To analyze the effect of deletion of RTA3 on the transcriptome in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Similar to S. cerevisiae Rta1 (role in 7-aminocholesterol resistance) and Rsb1 (flippase); putative drug-responsive regulatory site; induced by fluphenazine, estradiol, ketoconazole, caspofungin; rat catheter biofilm induced

DESIGN
Agilent Custom  Whole Genome Candida albicans 8x15k Gene Expression  (AMADID: 026377) designed by Genotypic Technology private Limited, Bangalore  , Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442) rta3 mutant samples vs. wt samples; samples were not treated

PLATFORM
GPL21450 Agilent-026377 Candida albicans Custom Gene Expression Microarray 8x15K
