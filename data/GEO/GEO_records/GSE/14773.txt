TITLE
Roles of  EMT regulator in colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Isolation and enrichment of cancer stem cells in colorectal carcinoma to study role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition regilators in tumor malignancy.

DESIGN
Genome-wide comparision in sphere cells and parental control cells revealed potential regulators involved tumor malignancy . Overexpression of these key regulators drafted cellular context toward therapy resistance
