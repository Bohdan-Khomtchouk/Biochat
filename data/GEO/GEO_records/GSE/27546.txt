Effects of HMGN variants on cellular transcription profile

SUMMARY
HMGN (high mobility group N) is a family of intrinsically disordered nuclear proteins that binds to nucleosomes, alters the structure of chromatin and affects transcription. A major unresolved question is the extent of functional specificity, or redundancy, between  the various members of the HMGN protein family. Here we analyze the transcriptional profile of cells in which the expression of various HMGN proteins has been either deleted or doubled. The results reveal an HMGN-variant specific effect on the fidelity of the cellular transcription profile, indicating that functionally, the various HMGN subtypes are not fully redundant.
