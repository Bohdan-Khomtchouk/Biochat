TITLE
Beauveria bassiana multiprotein bridging factor 1 (BbMBF1) regulating genes involved in fungal response to the prolonged thermal stress

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860

SUMMARY
BbMBF1 played crucial roles in mediating response the prolonged thermal stress, a determinant to the environmental fitness of fungal entomopathogens. We characterized for the first time that disruption of BbMBF1 reduced  the mycelial tolerance to the 9-h thermal stress under 40°C. The global transcriptome  involved in the response to the thermal stress was analyzed by using high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our transcriptional profiles revealed that numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which involved in metabolism, cell transport and cell rescue, were significantly involved in fungal response to the themal stress.

DESIGN
1. Total RNA obtained from BbMBF1 disruption mutant were compared to that of wild type strain under control conditin (free of thermal stress); 2. Total RNA obtained from BbMBF1 disruption mutant were compared to that of WT strain under 9-h thermal stress at 40°C.
