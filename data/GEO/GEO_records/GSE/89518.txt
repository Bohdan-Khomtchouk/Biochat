TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to find genomic regions that show differences in DNA methylation status between the MRL/MpJ mouse, which show enhanced regeneration response, and two control mouse strains C57BL/6J and BALB/c.

DESIGN
genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in a collection of tissues (ears, heart, spleens, livers, bone marrows) of C57BL/6J, BALB/c and MRL/MpJ mouse

PLATFORM
GPL15761 NimbleGen mouse DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays
