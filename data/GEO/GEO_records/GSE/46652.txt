TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Rnase H overexpression

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Transcripts up- or down-regulated comparing a strain where Rnase H is ectopically overexpressed versus wild type (empty vector); assessing the effect of DNA:RNA hybrid degradation on the transcriptome.
