TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Rnase H overexpression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcripts up- or down-regulated comparing a strain where Rnase H is ectopically overexpressed versus wild type (empty vector); assessing the effect of DNA:RNA hybrid degradation on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Strains harboring the RNase H1 over-expression plasmid (p425-GPD-RNase H1) or control plasmid (p425-GPD) were grown in SC-Leucine at 30°C. For both sets of microarray experiments, duplicate cultures were analyzed. Total RNA was isolated from 1 unit of A600 mid-log phase cells using a RiboPure Yeast kit (A & B Applied Biosystems), amplified, labeled and fragmented using a Message Apm III RNA Amplification Kit (A & B Applied Biosystems) and hybridized to a GeneChIP Yeast Genome 2.0 array using the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit (Affymetrix). Arrays were scanned by the Gene Chip Scanner 3000 7G and expression data was extracted using Expression Console™ Software (Affymetrix) with the MAS5.0 statistical algorithm.
