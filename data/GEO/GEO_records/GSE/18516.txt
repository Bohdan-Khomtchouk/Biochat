TITLE
Analysis of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules expression in ALL cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells lines JM-1, REH, Nalm-27, and SUP-B15 were analyzed for baseline expression of extacellular matrix and adhesion molecules using a pathway focused cDNA microarray (SABiosciences).

DESIGN
RNA isolated from the ALL cell lines JM-1, REH, Nalm-27, and SUP-B15 was analyzed using the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Molecules Oligo GEArray (SABIosciences).
