TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between Xist KO GS cells and wild type GS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression between Xist KO germ line stem GS cells and wildtype GS cells

DESIGN
The gene expression of GS cells derived from postnatal mouse testis was investigated. RNA from Xist KO-,  wildtype-GS cells, and ES cells were used for this study. 3 independent samples from each cell line were used.
