TITLE
Gene expression-based analysis of neural tube closure for the posterior neuropore of Fkbp8 embryos at E9.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three wildtype and three nullizygous embryonic posterior neural tube tissues were collected at embryonic day 9.5 and the gene expression patterns were profiled on CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays.

DESIGN
Wild type versus nullizygous Fkbp8 embryonic tissues were compared individually and as separate groups to determine classifiers and differences in expression due to the nullizygous mutation.
