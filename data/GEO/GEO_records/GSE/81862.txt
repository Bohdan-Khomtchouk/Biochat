TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone variant H3.3 occupancy in zebrafish cardiomyocytes [H33]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report high-throughput profiling of transgenic histone H3.3 in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. The replacement histone H3.3 is deposited at sites of nucleosome turnover including regions of active chromatin. We profile H3.3 in uninjured cardiomyocytes, those undergoing regeneration 14 days after genetic ablation and those proliferating 7 days after Nrg1 stimulated hyperplasia. This study provides a framework for understanding chromatin transitions during adult models of regeneration.

DESIGN
Examination of H3.3 occupancy in cardiomyocytes under different states of proliferation.
