TITLE
Sicd2 mouse hippocampus exon array analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST arrays to identify potential changes in alternative splicing between a subcongenic interval of the QTL Sicd2 on Chr 15 and their FVB-like littermates.  Results implicate novel candidate genes conferring susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the hippocampus of 8 Sicd2-ISCL4 subcongenic mice and 8 FVB-like littermates.
