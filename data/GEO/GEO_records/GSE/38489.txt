TITLE
Gene expression profiling in senescence leaves from senescence-inducible LEC2 in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The profiling was conducted with the 385K Microarray manufactured at NimbleGen, Inc ( ) designed from 30,386 genes of Arabidopsis (TAIR v.6). RNA samples of leaves of S1 (100% green leaf from 40 days plant) and S3 (more than 50% yellow leaf) senescence stages from senescence-inducible LEC2 transgenic plant, OIL21 were subjected for analysis of Arabidopsis 385K transcriptome. Expression of 3,025 genes were significantly changed with log2 ratios greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 in S1 or S3 stage (p value < 0.05), among which 1491 were up-regulated and 1534 were down regulated. Gene annotation revealed that 7.4% genes, 223 out of 3,025 changed by LEC2 were encoded transcription factors (TF). 106 TFs were up-regulated and 115 TFs were down-regulated.

DESIGN
A total of 9 chips were used for microarray. Total RNAs were extracted from senescence leaves at S1 and S3 stages of wild-type and senescence-inducible LEC2 transgenic Arabidopsis. Experiments were triplicated.
