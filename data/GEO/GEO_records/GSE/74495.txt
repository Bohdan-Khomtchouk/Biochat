TITLE
Expression data from differentiating primary culture of equine satellite cells (ESC) β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate  (HMB)

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate-treated (24h) differentiating equine satellite cells (3rd day of differentiation) compared to control HMB-untreated cells. Goal was to determine the effects of HMB influence on gene expression in equine satellite cells during in vitro myogenesis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, HMB-treated (24h) differentiating equine satellite cells (3rd day of differentiation) vs. differentiating equine satellite cells without HMB treatment (control). Biological replicates: 4 reps of examined condition (Cy5), 4 control replicates (Cy3)

PLATFORM
GPL15189 Agilent-021322 Horse Gene Expression Microarray [Feature Number version]
