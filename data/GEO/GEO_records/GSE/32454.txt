TITLE
Expression data for MCMV-treated compared to Mock-treated Mut3 neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MCMV has been reported to infect neural stem cells in the subventricular zone.  These same cells have been shown to give rise to gliomas.  We wanted to test expression levels of RNA in this cell population after MCMV infection in a mouse model of glioma.

DESIGN
Mut3 mice were either MCMV- or Mock-treated at perinatal day 2.  At 4-weeks-old mice were sacrificed and neurospheres from the subventricular zone were harvested.  After 4-5 passages total RNA was extracted from growing neurospheres.
