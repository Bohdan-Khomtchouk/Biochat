TITLE
Exon-array profiling of Heat-shock stress response in HeLa cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The heat-shock stress response was studied at the level of exons using Affymetrix Exon-array profiling for both sense and anti-sense transcripts. Sense transcript profiling was done as per the protocol of Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array and anti-sense transcript array profiling was done using a modified protocol (Xijin Ge et al., BMC Genomics. 2008 Jan 22;9:27). In short, for profiling antisense transcripts, first cycle cDNA synthesis and IVT step is skipped. This modified protocol starts directly from the second cycle cDNA synthesis step. The labelled target DNA fragments are in reverse orientation of original mRNAs. Thus the hybridization signals will represent transcripts from the same exonic regions but from the opposite DNA strand.

DESIGN
Study was undertaken with 2 biological replicates each for - a) Heat-shock treated Sense b) Heat-shock treated Anti-sense c) Untreated control Sense d) Untreated control Anti-Sense
