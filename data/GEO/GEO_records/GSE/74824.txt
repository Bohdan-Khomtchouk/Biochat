TITLE
Expression data of Cohesin-deficient, human cord blood-derived, hematopoietic CD34 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Decreased levels of Cohesin proteins increases the amount of primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in an in vitro setting. We used microarrays to detail the changes in global transcription programme to understand the underlying mechanisms behind this phenotype. Of note, we discover that hematopoietic stem cell-specific genes are upregulated in cells with decreased Cohesin levels.

DESIGN
CD34 positive cells were isolated from human cord blood (not older than 24h), lentivirally transduced with shRNA targeting different members of the Cohesin complex. In order to focus on immediate changes, transduced cells were sorted 36 hours post transduction and analyzed.
