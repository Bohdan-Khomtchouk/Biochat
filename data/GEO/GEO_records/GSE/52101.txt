TITLE
Transcript abundance comparison between BALB/c ears inoculated with Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania mexicana plus promastigote secretory gel (PSG)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the modulation of gene expression of  Leishmania mexicana(M379)-inoculated BALB/c ears  in the presence of promastigote secretory gel (PSG)

DESIGN
A genome-wide transcriptional analysis was performed by comparing the gene expression profiles of Leishmania mexicana- inoculated BALB/c ears and Leishmania mexicana plus PSG BALB/c ears.  Leishmania mexicana amastigotes were purified from mouse cutaneous lesions and transformed in vitro in metacycic promastigotes (MT). After 6, 24 and 48 hours, ears were collected and processed for RNA extraction. Three Biological replicates per condition were run.
