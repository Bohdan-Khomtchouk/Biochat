TITLE
Direct target gene analyses for TCP20 using a glucocorticoid inducible TCP20 (TCP20-GR)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF1) transcription factors control developmental processes in plants. We identified direct target genes of the Arabidopsis class I TCP20 protein in leaf development based on a glucocorticoid receptor induction assay and genome-wide expression studies. For this, we tagged TCP20 with a glucucorticoid receptor (GR) domain and transformed the resulting TCP20-GR construct into tcp20 knockout plants. Induction of these and wild type controls was done with Dexamethasone and Cycloheximide. Plants were harvested 8 h after induction, uninduced plants were taken as control.

DESIGN
In sum, 8 samples, each pools of 30 seedlings. Wild type and TCP20-GR plants at induction times t=0 and t=8, in two biological replicates.
