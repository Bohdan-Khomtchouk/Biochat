TITLE
Expression data from E161K LMNA mutant heart and control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Over 180 LMNA gene mutations have been identified in human diseases including cardiac and skeletal myopathies, lipodystrophies, and premature aging syndromes.  Postulated mechanisms by which these mutations result in different phenotypes include perturbation of normal nuclear structure and chromosome organization, and gene activity. We investigated whether a cardiomyopathic LMNA mutation, E161K, displayed abnormal gene expression.  We compared the gene expression profile in the E161K LMNA-mutant heart to that of an end stage LMNA-normal heart.
