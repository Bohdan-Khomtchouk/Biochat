TITLE
Gene expression arrays for different dendritic cell subset

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further distinguish the different subset of DCs, changes in gene expression were analyzed using Agilent mouse gene expression 4×44,000 microarrays. BALB/C mouse bone marrow–derived imDCs and maDCs were generated from bone marrow progenitors. Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells cocultured with Sca-1+Lin-CD117- MSCs could differentiate into a novel IL-10-dependent regDC subset-sDCs. The gene expression differentiations of the four groups (imDCs, maDCs, sDCs and neutralizing antibody-IL-10-treated sDCs) were analyzed by GeneChip microarray.

DESIGN
The formed four groups of cells (imDCs, maDCs, sDCs and neutralizing antibody-IL-10-treated sDCs) were purified respectively, and then gene expression in them was measured.
