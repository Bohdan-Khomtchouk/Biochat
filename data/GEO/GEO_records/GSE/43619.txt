TITLE
Activation of beta-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC patients)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CTNNB1 is the most frequently mutated gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its clinical relevance remains controversial. We determined an evolutionarily conserved Î²-catenin signature by comparative analysis of gene expression data from human HCC and a mouse model (GSE43628). We generated gene expression data from the tumors of 88 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection as the primary treatment. We used these gene expression data to develop a new prognostification model for prognosis of HCC after surgery.

DESIGN
We generated gene expression data from the tumors of 88 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection as the primary treatment.
