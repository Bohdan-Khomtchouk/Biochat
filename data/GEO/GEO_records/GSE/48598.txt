TITLE
Gene expression profile in the liver of insulin-deficient mice with icv leptin administration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in the liver of insulin-deficient mice regulated by icv leptin administration. Control group received icv PBS administration. Icv leptin administration ameliorates hyperglycemia in insulin-deficient mice. Our transcriptome data provides important aspects of the leptin’s anti-type 1 diabetes action.

DESIGN
Mice were harvested 10 days after icv leptin administration (25ng/0.11uL/hour). Liver samples were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at –80ºC. RNAs were extracted by Qiagen mRNA extract kits (RNeasy plus). gDNA was eliminated in this procedure by gDNA eliminator column, which is included in Qiagen mRNA extract kits. Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at UT-Southwestern ( ) checked RNA quality with Bioanalyzer Chip and processed the samples for hybridization with Illumina Mouse-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).
