TITLE
miRNA Expression Data from Ovarian Cancer Exosomes and Cells of Origin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix miRNA microarray to identify the oncogenic and tumor-suppressor miRNAs differentially expressed between exosomes and the originating cells.

DESIGN
Exosomes were isolated from 6 different ovarian cancer cell lines and one normal ovarian cell line (HIO180). Following miRNA isolation, samples were used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Contributor: Noncoding RNA Program at the Center for Targeted Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center
