TITLE
MCF10A cells expressing HER2 and HER3 and grown in three-dimensional cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The tyrosine kinase receptors HER2 and HER3 play an important role in breast cancer. The HER2/HER3 heterodimer is a critical oncogenic unit associated with reduced relapse-free and decreased overall survival. We provide gene expression profile of the mammary epithelial cells MCF10A expressing HER2, HER3 or HER2/HER3 and grown in three-dimensional cultures for 15 days in the presence of heregulin, a known HER3-ligand that stabilizes and activates the HER2/HER3 heterodimer.

DESIGN
The mammary epithelial cells MCF10A were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing HER2, HER3 or both. Cells from each group were grown for 15 days in three-dimensional cultures. At the end of the experiment, RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis.
