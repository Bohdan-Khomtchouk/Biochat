TITLE
Genome-wide bisulfite sequencing reveals enhancer as main target of DNA methyltion in neural conversion [Bisulfite-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide bisulfite sequencing and corresponding transcriptome are analyzed together to seek for methylation target during neural differentiation

DESIGN
H1 human embryonic stem cells are able to differentiated into neural stem cells with induction of compound C in 72h. We extracted genomic DNA from 0, 24, 48h samples during induction and measured their DNA methylation level by BS-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
