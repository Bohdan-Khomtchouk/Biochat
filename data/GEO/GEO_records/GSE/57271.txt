TITLE
Novel culture conditions facilitating the induction of naïve pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is now well recognized that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)1 closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs)2-5 exhibiting primed pluripotency unlike mouse ESCs (mESCs) which acquire a naïve pluripotent state4-8. Efforts have been made to trigger naïve pluripotency in hESCs9-11 for subsequent unbiased lineage-specific differentiation, a common conundrum faced by primed pluripotent hESCs due to heterogeneity in gene expression existing within and between hESC lines12. We report here a novel culture medium facilitating rapid induction of naïve pluripotency in established hESCs. Our medium also allows derivation of naïve mESCs from blastocyst stage which has not been shown earlier. The established naïve hESCs could survive long-term single cell passaging, maintain a normal karyotype, exhibit upregulation of naïve pluripotency genes and were dependent on signaling pathways similar to naïve mESCs. Also, they undergo global DNA demethylation, cluster together with previously described naïve hESCs13 and show a distinctive long non-coding RNA profile. Collectively, we demonstrate an alternate route to capture naïve pluripotency in hESCs which is fast, reproducible, can be employed to derive naïve mESCs and can induce efficient differentiation.

DESIGN
Three primed and matching naive human embryonic stem cell lines were profiled in duplo.
