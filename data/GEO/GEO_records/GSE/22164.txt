TITLE
Physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Biofilms Revealed by Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Abstract: Transcriptome analysis was applied to characterize the physiological activities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown for three days in drip-flow biofilm reactors. Conventional applications of transcriptional profiling often compare two paired data sets that differ in a single experimentally controlled variable. In contrast this study obtained the transcriptome of a single biofilm state, ranked transcript signals to make the priorities of the population manifest, and compared rankings for a priori identified physiological marker genes between the biofilm and published data sets.

DESIGN
Two drip flow biofilm conditions with three replicates each:  (1) baseline control at 72hrs, (2) no treatment for 12 hours past baseline. Data from these two conditions were pooled

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
