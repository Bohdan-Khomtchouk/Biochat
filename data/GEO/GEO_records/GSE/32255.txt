TITLE
JmjD2d-dependence of LPS-induced genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In dendritic cells, expression of the H3K9me3 demethylase JmjD2d is upregulated by LPS stimulation.  To identify genes whose induction by LPS depends on JmjD2d activity, we performed a microarray analysis of wild-type and JmjD2d-knockdown dendritic cells, before and after stimulation with LPS.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from three independent cultures of wild-type and JmjD2d-knockdown dendritic cells, before and 4h after stimulation with 100ng/ml LPS.  The unstimulated and stimulated wild-type samples, and the stimulated JmjD2d-knockdown samples, were used for microarray analysis.
