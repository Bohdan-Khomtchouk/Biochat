ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Although many regulatory components of light signaling have been functionally characterized, only a few of them have been reported to cross talk with other signaling cascades. In this study, we have analyzed the expression profiles of Arabidopsis genes in wild-type, atmyc2 mutant, cop1-6 mutant, and atmyc2 cop1-6 double mutant seedlings grown under constant dark, constant blue-light, and constant blue-light along with abscisic acid (ABA) to illustrate the interplay of negative regulators, AtMYC2 and COP1, in light and ABA signaling Keywords: Light and abscisic acid treatment

DESIGN
Expression data for wild-type, atmyc2, cop1-6, and atmyc2 cop1-6 seedlings under constant dark, blue-light and blue-light along with abscisic acid Ten-day-old Arabidopsis (wild-type, atmyc2 mutant, cop1-6 mutant, and atmyc2 cop1-6 double mutant) seedlings grown under constant dark, constant blue-light (35 µmol/sec/m2), and constant blue-light along with ABA (0.5 µm) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two biological replicates of each sample were used for microarray analysis.
