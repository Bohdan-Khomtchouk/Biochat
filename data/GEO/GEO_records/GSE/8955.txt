atmyc2_cop1_mutant_light_ABA_treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Although many regulatory components of light signaling have been functionally characterized, only a few of them have been reported to cross talk with other signaling cascades. In this study, we have analyzed the expression profiles of Arabidopsis genes in wild-type, atmyc2 mutant, cop1-6 mutant, and atmyc2 cop1-6 double mutant seedlings grown under constant dark, constant blue-light, and constant blue-light along with abscisic acid (ABA) to illustrate the interplay of negative regulators, AtMYC2 and COP1, in light and ABA signaling Keywords: Light and abscisic acid treatment
