TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The early-onset breast cancer patients (age ≤40) often display higher incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and poorer five-year survival than the late-onset patients. To identify the genes and molecules associated with poor prognosis of early-onset breast cancer, we examined gene expression profiles from paired breast normal/ tumor tissues, and coupled with Gene Ontology and public data base analysis. Our data showed that the expression of GAS7b gene was lower in the early-onset breast cancer patients as compared to the elder patients. We found that GAS7 was associated with CYFIP1 and WAVE2 complex to suppress breast cancer metastasis via blocking CYFIP1 and Rac1 protein interaction, actin polymerization, and β1-integrin/FAK/Src signaling. We further demonstrated that p53 directly regulated GAS7 gene expression, which was inversely correlated with p53 mutations in breast cancer specimens. Our study uncover a novel regulatory mechanism of p53 in early-onset breast cancer progression through GAS7-CYFIP1 mediated signaling pathways.

DESIGN
The total RNA of 25 sets of normal/ tumor pair of breast tissue specimens was extracted, and analyzed by Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array.
