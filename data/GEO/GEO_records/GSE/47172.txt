TITLE
Expression data from human response to invasive pneumococcal disease.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is differential expression of genes between cases and controls using microarray analysis, and genes that are crucial for host defence responses are significantly up-regulated in cases during pneumococcal infection.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the levels of mRNA between cases and controls and to evaluate whether  this is influenced by underlying HIV cormobidity, and if association with different disease outcomes (death vs. survival) exists.

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
