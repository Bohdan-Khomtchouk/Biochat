TITLE
Transcriptome-wide modulation of splicing by the exon junction complex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that knockdown of EJC core proteins, eIF4A3, Y14, Magoh, causes a transcript-wide changes in alternative splicing, as well as some transcriptional changes. These changes are specific to EJC core proteins, and KD of UPF1 protein caused different sets of alterantive splicing changes. These changes are linked to the rate of transcription.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different knockdown, as well as GFP knockdown in HeLa cells, 2 replicates each condition.

PLATFORM
