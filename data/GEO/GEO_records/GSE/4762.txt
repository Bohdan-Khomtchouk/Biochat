TITLE
Rootstock-dependent gene expression profiling in apple scions

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
The purpose of this project is to examine the effects of rootstocks on the gene expression patterns in scions of  apple trees.  Gene expression patterns were examined in the Gala variety grafted onto seven different, commonly used rootstocks.  These trees were grown in the greenhouse to limit environmental effects.  Also, gene expression profiles were examined in three different varieties (Ambrosia, Melrose,and Gala) grafted onto B.9 rootstocks grown in the field. Keywords: apple, rootstock, graft, scion
