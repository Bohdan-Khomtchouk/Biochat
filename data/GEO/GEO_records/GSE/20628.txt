TITLE
The dikaryon formation (mating) transcriptome of the basidomycete fungus Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus)

ORGANISM
Coprinopsis cinerea

SUMMARY
Mating compatibility in C. cinerea is controlled by two loci, A and B.  Following fusion of undifferentiated hyphal cells, a complex program is initiated which results in the maintenance of one nucleus from each parent in every cell (the dikaryon).  We identified downstream targets of the A locus (A on), the B locus (B on), and both loci (Aon Bon) using strains in which the two pathways are activated separately, and a dikaryotic strain. keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Four biological replicate samples of each experimental strain were taken.  Labelled cDNA was hybridized to arrays in a 2 channel reaction.  The reference sample was an unmated monokaryotic strain.
