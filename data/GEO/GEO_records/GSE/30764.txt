TITLE
RNA sequencing reveals differential expression of mitochondrial and oxidation reduction genes in the long-lived naked mole-rat when compared to mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Heterocephalus glaber

SUMMARY
The goal was to find genes which are differentially expressed between the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) and the wild-type mice liver tissue. The genes which are most differentially expressed may provide a clue for the remarkable differences between naked mole-rat and mouse in terms of longevity, cancer resistance and adaptation to subterranean environments.

DESIGN
Analysis of 2 mRNA samples, one pooled from 3 wild-type mice liver tissue and another pooled from 3 naked mole-rat liver tissue.
