TITLE
Time course h2o2 treatment-involvement of small non coding RNAs in Arabidopsis responses to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-10_oxydative--stress - time course h2o2 treatment - Effect of an hydrogen peroxide treatment on gene regulation in arabidopsis cells - Arabidopsis cells (5 days after subculturing) were cultured at 21degreeC, 8 h photoperiod under agitation. H2O2 2.5 uM was added to cells 5 days after subculturing and 2 hours after the beginning of the light period. Treated and control cells were collected 15 min, 1 h, 5 h and 12 h after treatment. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
