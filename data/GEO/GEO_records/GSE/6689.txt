TITLE
Expression data during stem cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell development requires selection of specific genetic programs to direct cellular fate. Using microarray technology, we profile expression trends at selected timepoints during stem cell differentiation to characterize these changes. Keyword(s): timecourse

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using the Micro-to-Midi isolation kit (Invitrogen), and subjected to comparative gene expression profiling by labelled cRNA hybridization to the mouse genome 430 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix). Data acquired using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 was analyzed with the Genespring GX 7.3 microarray data software bioinformatics suite (Agilent Technologies) restricting the derived gene list to identify differentially expressed genes defined by a > 1.5-fold difference and P < 0.05. Data population sets were normalized to the undifferentiated phenotype, and quality filtered to eliminate background noise prior to hierarchical clustering.
