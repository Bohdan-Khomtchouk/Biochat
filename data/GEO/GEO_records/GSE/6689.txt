TITLE
Expression data during stem cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell development requires selection of specific genetic programs to direct cellular fate. Using microarray technology, we profile expression trends at selected timepoints during stem cell differentiation to characterize these changes. Keyword(s): timecourse
