TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles of side population and non-side population cells of malignant pleural mesothelioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which is associated with occupational asbestos exposure, is a deadly disease with no effective treatments due mainly to its high resistance to anti-cancer drugs. The molecular mechanisms responsible for its chemotherapeutic resistance are complicated and undefined. However, the presence of side population cells (SP cells) in tumors is a well-accepted explanation for their anti-cancer drug resistance. To identify SP cell-specific gene expression signature, microarray technique has been employed. Our data show differential gene expression profiles between SP and non-SP cells of H2714 mesothelioma cells. SP cells over-expressed genes associated with cancer stem cell (CSC) and drug resistance: DUSP6, SPRY2 and IL6, as well as multi-pathways, including the cancer stem cell-associated pathways Notch and c-Kit.  Therefore, we believe that targeting CSC-specific genes and pathways in SP cells may hold the key to the discovery of effective treatments for reversing chemotherapeutic resistance to MPM treatment.
