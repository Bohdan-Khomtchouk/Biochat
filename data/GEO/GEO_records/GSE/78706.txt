TITLE
RNAseq Reveals Virulence-Specific Host Responses to M. tuberculosis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We infect bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either a Hyper or Hypovirulent Mycobacterium tuberculolsis strain and assess the host response to these bacteria through RNAseq

DESIGN
Uninfected BMDMs served as controls, BMDMs infected with Hypervirulent M.tb (designated R55), BMDMs infected with Hypovirulent m.tb (designated R50). 3 groups with 3 biological replicates, each analysed in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL15907 AB 5500xl Genetic Analyzer (Mus musculus)
