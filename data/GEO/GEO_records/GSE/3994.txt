Pac1+/+ versus Pac1-/- BMMCs_IgE-DNP 2 h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived mast cells were differentiated over 4-6 weeks using bone marrow from Pac-1+/+ and Pac1-/- littermate mice. Cell purity was 99% c-kit and Fc epsilon receptor positive as assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were stimulated by Fc epsilon receptor crosslinking using IgE-DNP/HSA for sensitization for 18 hours and DNP-HSA antigen for crosslinking for 2 hours. Gene transcript abundance was determined and scaled to 150 using alogorithms in MicroArray Analysis Suite Software 5.0 (Affymetrix). Keywords: Cpmparison of Pac-1+/+ and Pac-1-/- activated BMMCs
