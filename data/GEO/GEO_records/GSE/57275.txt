TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in lung cells from metformin treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Metfromin induced changes in the lung cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mouse at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was whether metformin has any effect on the host immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mice? Results provide important information on the effect of metformin on the inflammatory response and immune activation associated with mycobacterial infection. In conclusion, Metfromin normalizes the chronic inflammation associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from lung cells of untreated and metformin (500 mg/Kg) treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mouse. The treatment was started day 7 post-infection and was given for 30 days post-initiation.
