TITLE
abaseed-ABA signaling in Arabidopsis seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra14-04_nced - abaseed - Identification of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling factors and targets in Arabidopsis developing seeds by comparing ABA deficient and wild type genotypes. Transcriptome comparison of developing seeds harvested at 14 DAP from two ABA-deficient mutants (nced2 nced5 nced9 and nced2 nced5 nced6 nced9) and wild type (Columbia-0).

DESIGN
6 dye-swaps - gene knockout, genomic comparison.

PLATFORM
GPL17404 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K [120228_Athal_CATMA62_AA_exp]
