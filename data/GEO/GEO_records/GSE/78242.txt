TITLE
Expression data of soybean accessions under different phosphorus treatments

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Phosphorus is one of the most important macronutrients that is required for plant growth and development. However, stress under low-P conditions has become a limiting factor that affects crop yields and qualities. Plants have developed strategies to cope with this, while few genes associated with low-P tolerance have been identified in soybean. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression under different phosphorus treatments of two soybean accessions CD and YH with different phosphorus efficiency.

DESIGN
The roots and leaves of a low-P-tolerant accession and a low-P-sensitive accession were harvested after 10 days of hydroponics under different P treatments, each with three biological replicates.Then microarray chips were performed on the 24 samples. We sought to identify genes associated with low-P stress. To that end, we analyzed the differently expressed genes between different P treatments, different accessions and different tissues.
