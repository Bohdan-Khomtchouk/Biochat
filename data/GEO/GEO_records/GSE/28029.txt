TITLE
MicroRNAs Associated with Metastatic Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes with the potential target of differentially expressed miRNA in metastatic prostate cancer, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. Transplantable metastatic versus a non-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft line, both derived from one patientâ€™s primary cancer, were developed via sub-renal capsule grafting of cancer tissue into NOD/SCID mice. The same RNA samples from both lines were also used for miRNA sequencing. Overlapped genes of predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed in microarray platform showed potential markers of combination of miRNA and gene in metastatic prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Gene expression in metastatic/non-metastatic prostate cancer was measured. Same total RNA samples were used for small RNA library construction for miRNA sequencing. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study.
