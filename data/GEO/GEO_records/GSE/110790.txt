TITLE
Gene expression in WT and Flt3 KO pDCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine whether there are any gene expression changes in pDCs from WT and Flt3 KO mice. Specifically whether developing in the absence of Flt3 signaling had any effects on the gene expression of the pDCs

DESIGN
Mature pDCs were sorted from spleens of WT and Flt3 KO mice, there were two biological replicates for each cell type from each genotype

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
