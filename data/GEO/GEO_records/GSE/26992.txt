TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression by ileum enterocytes following treatment with probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression when probiotics are in the neonatal mouse gut (4 hrs) and after they had been excreted (24 hrs post-gavage)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse ileum epithelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection 4 or 24 hours after a single orogastric gavage with probiotic or vehicle (PBS)
