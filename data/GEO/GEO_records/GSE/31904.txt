mRNA expression profiling in nine human tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiled mRNA gene expression in nine different commercially purchased total RNA samples which were also profiled for miRNAs.

DESIGN
500ng toal RNA from each tissue was labeled and hybridized in at least duplicate, using Agilent Low Input Linear Amplification Kit.
