TITLE
Genome-wide methylation profile of Lymphocytes and induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vα24 invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes implicated in the regulation of broad immune responses. They recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d on antigen-presenting cells and induce both innate and adaptive immune responses, which enhance effective immunity against cancer, represent promising therapeutic target. However, reduced iNKT-cell numbers and function have been observed in many patients with cancer. To overcome this obstacle, we reprogramed human iNKT cells to pluripotency and then redifferentiated into regenerated iNKT cells in vitro through IL-7/IL-15-based optimized cytokine combination. They showed proliferation and IFN-γ production in response to α-galactosylceramide, induced dendritic cell maturation and downstream activation of cancer antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro, and exhibited NKG2D- and DNAM-1-mediated natural killer celllike cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. Their immunological features and availability in an unlimited supply from induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential to develop effective immunotherapies against cancer.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the lymphocytes (n = 6) and undifferentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (n = 3) were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
