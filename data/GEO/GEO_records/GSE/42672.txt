TITLE
Conversion of human fibroblast to endothelial cell by defined factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient pluripotency-factor-based signaling-directed (TPS) transdifferentiation  approach could be further applied to generate functional induced endothelial (iEnd) cells  from human fibroblasts with only two factors: Oct4 and Klf4 (OK). The iEnd cells exhibit  characteristic endothelial cell phenotype in vitro and in vivo and are capable of functionally  promoting vascular regeneration and blood perfusion in a murine model of PAD.

DESIGN
Human fibroblasts were transfected with Oct4 and Klf4 then changed to endothelial cell culture media with growth factors. iENDs were purified by FACS and enriched in EGM2 media.
