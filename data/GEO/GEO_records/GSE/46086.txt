TITLE
DNA microarray data from root of transgenic rice Huahui 1 (HH1) and its parent Minghui 63 (MH63)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis has been proved to be an effective method in investigating unintended effects in genetically modified (GM) crops. However, unintended effects of GM plants in leaves through DNA microarray analysis has many researches, but research of unintended effects of GM plants of the underground portion has few. In this study, DNA microarray analysis was used to detect DEG in  underground portions between transgenic rice HH1 and its non-transgenic control MH63. We used microarrays to study unintended effects in root of transgenic rice Huahui 1.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from root of HH1 and MH63  at 30-day old and were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected diferentially expressed genes and common significantly changed pathways hoping to as a clue to  investigate unintended effects of HH1 root.
