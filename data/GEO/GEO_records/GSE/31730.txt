TITLE
Comparison of global expression profile of bulge and hairshaft of the hair follicle in murine skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess potential differences in skin stem cells and their associated stromal cells

DESIGN
Total RNA of specific substructures of the hair follicle (bulge and hairshaft) were collected by laser-capture micro-dissection and resulting amplified cDNA hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.
