TITLE
Study of UVB responses of SV40 transformed human lung fibroblast: Control vs. UVB irradiated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies showed that SV40 transformed cells have unique DNA damage responses; further inspecting these responses by microarray provides an opportunity to discover transciprtional insights of DNA damage responses after UVB irradiation. This study is used to comapre to GSE7589, our previous study of human normal lung fibroblast after UVB irradiation.

DESIGN
We used a loop design in this study, cDNA microarray experiment consisted of eight RNA samples, including UVB-irradiated samples and their corresponding controls of 4 time points after UV irradiation.
