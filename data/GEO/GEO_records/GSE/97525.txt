TITLE
F2 progeny of AKHR mutant and obese parents and controls, 10-11 days old adults

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transgenerational effects of parental metabolic state have been shown, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here we present transcriptome sequencing data from the F2 progeny of obese maternal or paternal grandfathers compared to genetically matched wild-type controls

DESIGN
3 samples descended from obese grandfathers through the maternal F1, 3 samples descended from obese grandfathers through the paternal F1, and 3 wild-type controls, independent biological replicates and independent experimental replicates (1 set of samples from each experimental replicate)

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
