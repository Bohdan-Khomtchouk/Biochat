TITLE
Expression Data from Brucella abortus strain 2308 and isogenic vtlR mutant cells

ORGANISM
Brucella abortus

SUMMARY
VtlR (virulence-associated transcriptional LysR-family regulator) is thought to be a transcriptional regulator of B. abortus virulence determinants We used custom-made Affymetrix B. abortus strain 2308 derived GeneChips to compare the gene expression properties of wild type and isogenic vtlR mutant cells.

DESIGN
B. abortus strain 2308 or vltR mutant cells were grown to late exponential phase growth, total bacterial RNA was isolated and subjected to GeneChip hybridization and analysis.  We sought to determine the regulatory effects of VtlR.
