TITLE
Analysis of gene expression profiles of human melanoma A375 cells with or without CD10 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of CD10 in melanoma at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that CD10 promotes melanoma tumor progression. Results provide important information of the significant gene expression change between CD10-transfected and mock-transfected A375 cells, such as significantly increased genes included those related to anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CD10-transfected A375 melanoma cells was that from compared to mock-transfected A375 cells.
