TITLE
Zebrafish presenillin1 mutant transcriptome

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile comparing 17-month old wild-type with psen1hu2547 zebrafish.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 3-4 brains of 17-month old adult psen1hu2547 or WT fish was extracted using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen) and quality-checked using NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. cDNA was generated and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5-CTP using the low RNA input linear amplification kit (Perkin-Elmer). Upon purification and fragmentation, labeled cRNA was hybridized to the zebrafish 22K 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray (G2518A-001, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 65ÂºC for 17 hours. Three independent biological repeats were performed.
