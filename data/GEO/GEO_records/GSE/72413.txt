TITLE
Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Secretion of Cellobiohydrolases

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The aim of present study is to understand the impact of genetic engineering event, integration of ClCBH2 gene into yeast genome, as well as the subsequent biological process, such as expression and secretion of CBH2 protein. Further, the ‘dosage’ of genetic engineering event, the copy number inserted ClCBH2 gene, is also of particular interest. In parallel, the relationship between the copy number of ClCBH2 gene and the condition of yeast culture during CBH2 production, as well as the effect of these two factors towards yeast metabolism are investigated. Extensive transcriptomics analysis and comparison were conducted for three CBP yeast strains with different copy numbers of ClCBH2 gene, at two growth rates

DESIGN
A twenty-four array study using total RNA recovered from three CBP yeast strains with different copy numbers of ClCBH2 gene, at two growth rates
