TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans : Control (Wt) vs. ΔcnaA or alcApkcAΔcnaA

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing the mutant strain alcApkcA ΔcnaA and ΔcnaA grown on alcA inducing conditions. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to ΔcnaA phenotype supression by pkcA overexpression. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment : A. nidulans strains grown during 24 and 48 h at 37oC in glycerol 2% threonine 100mM.

PLATFORM
GPL15870 Agilent-029535 Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4 array [Feature Number version]
