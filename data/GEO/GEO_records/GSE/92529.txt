TITLE
Comparative analysis the transcriptomes of the hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola and the non-hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii (NHE)

ORGANISM
Sedum alfredii ; Sedum plumbizincicola

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to investigate whether the known mechanisms of hyperaccumulaion in Brassicaceae hyperaccumulators (Arabidopsis halleri and Noccaea caerulescens) are conserved among different hyperaccumulating species or if there exist unknown mechanismsin other metal hyperaccumulating species.The comparison of transcriptomes between hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola and non-hyperaccumulator S. alfredii (NHE) was performed by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing.The data suggested that increased active uptake, long-distance transport and efficient chelation of heavy metals might represent common mechanisms occurred in various hyperaccumulators. Moreover, we found that those genes showing constitutively higher expression in S. plumbizincicola shoots are significantly enriched in processes related to cell wall metabolism, including biosynthesis/modification of cellulose, lignin, pectin, glucan, and other cell wall related components.

DESIGN
Roche-454 was adopted to sequence the pooled root and shoot samples of S. plumbizincicola.Illumina sequencing was used to characterize the transcriptomes of root and shoot tissues of the two Sedum species with/out 10Î¼M Cd treatment.Biological replicates: 2 replicates for S. plumbizincicola samples.
