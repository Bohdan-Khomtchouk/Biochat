TITLE
Transcript profiling of normal oral keratinocytes and the tongue squamous cell carcinoma line LK0412

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study analyzed a unique, serum-free medium derived tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) line termed LK0412 relative to the normal state to elucidate biomarkers at the protein and transcript level. A bioinformatics approach using Gene Ontology categories, gene networks and signature evaluation was applied to combine the protein and transcript data for identification of various gene signatures. The generated signatures were further assessed in public available data sets from normal and tumor tongue tissues. The analysis identified a novel gene signature that may improve the diagnosis and treatment of TSCC.

DESIGN
Analysis of differential gene expression in LK0412 relative to the normal state. Both normal and LK0412 cells were cultured under a standardized serum-free condition.
