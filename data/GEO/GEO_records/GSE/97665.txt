TITLE
Gene expression from armored CAR T cell and TAMs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profile among armored IL-12 secreting CAR T cells and second-generation CAR T cells and TAMs recovered from both groups

DESIGN
CAR T cells and TAMs were recovered from tumor bearing mice treated with IL-12 secreting or second generation CAR T cells. RNA extracted and gene expression was analyzed with Nanostring
