TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of whole blood from healthy adult volunteers before and after receiving non-live vaccines including seasonal influenza or pneumococcal vaccine or placebo (saline) injections I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to: 1) Characterize the cellular origin of transciptional signatures observed on day 1 after vaccination with 2009/10 seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine discovered by transcriptional profiling of whole blood samples in data set “WholeBlood_SysVax”. 2) Discover potential biomarkers for immune-responsiveness to non-live vaccines.

DESIGN
In this Series, a total of 72 samples of leukocyte subsets (neutrophils, monocytes, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes) were isolated before and 24 hours after vaccination from 6 healthy adult individuals receiving seasonal influenza and 4 healthy adult individuals receiving pneumococcal vaccine. From each subject, neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll gradient separation and then CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were purified by sequential positive bead selection. Cells were transferred into RLT buffer and stored at -80ºC until mRNA extraction.
