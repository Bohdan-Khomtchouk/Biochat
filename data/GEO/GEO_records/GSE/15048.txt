TITLE
Gibberellin-induced gene expression in maize mesocotyl under deep-sowing condition

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of gibberellin (GA)-induced mesocotyl elongation, gene expression profiling analyses were performed in a deep-sowing tolerant maize inbred line 3681-4. Gene expression studies combing Affymetrix GeneChip analysis and Real-time PCR were employed to determine the molecular mechanism underlying GA promotion of maize mesocotyl elongation. These studies showed that the GA receptor GID1, the transcriptional factor MYB, and the genes encoding DELLA protein DWRF8, kinases, Raf, LRR, RLCK, and involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, aminosugars metabolism, cell wall synthesis and modification, might play critical roles in maize mesocotyl elongation.

DESIGN
In two independent experiments, we generate 10-day-old maize mesocotyl-specific gene expression profiles through comparing genome-wide expression patterns of GA3 treatment and UCZ (a GA biosynthesis inhibitor) treatment under 20 cm deep-sowing condition in darkness by using 17,555 Affymetrix maize whole genome array.
