TITLE
Sciatic nerve FAIRE-chip and ChIP-Chip with Egr2/Krox20 and Sox10

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Egr2/Krox20 and Sox10 regulate genes involved in formation of myelination in the peripheral nervous system. ChIP-chip assays were performed on rat sciatic nerve at P15, a peak timepoint of myelination. In addition, Faire was used to identify areas of open chromatin. This experiment includes a custom ChIP-chip design incorporating many genes that are dynamically regulated during peripheral nerve myelination. Two antibodies were used for Egr2, Abcam and Covance PRB-236P.

DESIGN
Egr2 and Sox10 ChIP samples were hybridized along with total input. In addition, FAIRE samples were hybridized relative to input DNA
