TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mouse testis after treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trichostatin A (TSA) is one of the most potent reversible histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In male mice, subcutaneous application of TSA is followed by infertility due to apoptosis of pachytene spermatocytes. To get more insight into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of murine testes after TSA treatment. The whole genome transcriptome analysis revealed 507 significantly regulated genes. Validation by real-time quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of 7 from 9 genes tested (78%).
