TITLE
Daily cycling of genome-wide histone methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Daily (circadian) clocks are essential for regulating and coordinating physiology in mammals. Modulation of local chromatin structure has been shown for only a small number of genes, principally thought to be directly modulated by Clock-mediated histone acetylation. Here we show that genome-wide changes of active and suppressive histone marks control global chromatin architecture over the day and night.

DESIGN
Examination of mouse liver tissue at 4 time-points around the clock in " free-running " , continuous conditions (constant darkness, temperature and food available ad libitum).

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
