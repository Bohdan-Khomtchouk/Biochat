TITLE
Microarray identification of functional modules involving Haptoglobin and/or Hemopexin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haptoglobin and Hemopexin are plasma acute phase proteins that bind with high affinity hemoglobin and heme, respectively. Several studies have demonstrated that they have a key role in the protection against oxidative stress and inflammation. However, little is known about the functional modules in which they are involved. To gain insights into this issue, we integrated bioinformatic and experimental approaches to identify genes coexpressed with Haptoglobin or Hemopexin and modulated in Haptoglobin and/or Hemopexin knock-out mice. These genes have a high probability to be functionally related to Haptoglobin and/or Hemopexin. Keywords: haptoglobin, hemopexin, microarray, bioinformatics
