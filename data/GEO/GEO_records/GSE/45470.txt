TITLE
Gene expression data from OX1 human induced Pluripotent Stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) and their differentiated progeny have great potential for modelling disease. To realise this potential, robust protocols need to be developed for deriving authentic differentiated cell lineages and these lineages need to be rigorously characterised. We have generated hiPSc using retrovirus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors, and have used them for assessing the efficiency of a defined protocol for differentiation to monocytes and macrophages. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability, and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets. van Wilgenburg B, Browne C and Cowley SA, submitted for publication

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from normal human dermal fibroblasts.
