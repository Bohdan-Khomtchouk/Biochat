TITLE
Effects of SPOP on gene expression in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SPOP is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor frequently mutated in prostate cancer. It is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of substrate proteins. We examined the impact of wild-type and mutant SPOP on the transcriptional profile of prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
We cloned several naturally occurring (in human prostate cancer) SPOP mutants and expressed the corresponding constructs in prostate cancer cells. Our experimental conditions were: Human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-Abl), transfected with control vector, SPOP-wt, and any of the following mutants: SPOP-F102C, SPOP-F133V, SPOP-F133L (2-4 biological replicates each). We analyzed their gene expression profiles for differences induced by SPOP-wt vs SPOP-mutant.
