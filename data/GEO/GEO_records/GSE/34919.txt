TITLE
Genome-wide Definition of the SigF Regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (ChIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
The genome wide ChIP-on-chip analysis to identify the DNA binding sites for the M.tuberculosis sigma factor Rv3286c (SigF)

DESIGN
SigF binding sites were determined by microarray analysis of anti-sigF immunoprecipitated DNA from H37Rv(ΔrsbW/sigF)::pmySigF compared to  H37Rv(ΔrsbW/sigF)::pMY769 (both cultured with pristinamycin for 3 days). 4 biological replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL15091 EPFL 4x44k OGT MTB microarray (both strands condense version)
