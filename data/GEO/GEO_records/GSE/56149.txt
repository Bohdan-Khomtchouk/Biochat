TITLE
Microarray analysis of a Drosophila dopamine transporter mutant, fumin (fmn)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We previously found a short sleeper mutant, fmn, and identified its mutation in the dopamine transporter gene. In an attempt to discover additional sleep related genes in Drosophila, we carried out a microarray analysis comparing mRNA expression in heads of fmn and control flies and found differentially expressed genes. Next, using the pan-neuronal Gal4 driver elav-Gal4 and UAS-RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown individual genes, we performed a functional screen.  We found that knockdown of the NMDA type glutamate receptor channel gene (Nmdar1) reduced sleep.

DESIGN
Control (w1118) and fmn flies collected every 4 h at seven time points under 12 h of light (zeitgeber time, ZT 0-12) followed by 12 h darkness (ZT 12-24) (LD) were analyzed.
