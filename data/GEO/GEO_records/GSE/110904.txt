TITLE
Gene expression in chicken embryo liver

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We have profiled the gene expression in eight chicken embryo livers in the 11th day of incubation. Four eggs (labelled as WAT1-4) were injected with 0.15 ml/egg deionized water in days 9, 10 an 11 post incubation while four eggs (labeled CTR1-4) were kept as environmental controls. We found that water injections had a very small effect, regulating less than 1% of the genes. Both WAT and CTR data sets were used as references in further experiments for eggs expossed to various water-soluble carcinogenic compounds.

DESIGN
Differently labelled biological replicas were co-hybridized with the same microarray. Expression of genes in similarly labeled samples of the two conditions were compared and the results averaged.
