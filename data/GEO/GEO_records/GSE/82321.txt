TITLE
Identification of symmetric methyltion of histone H4 arginine 3 on KSHV genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the symmetric methylation sites on KSHV genome during latency and lytic reactivation

DESIGN
KSHV infected, TRExBCBL1-RTA cells were induced with doxycycline for 24h to trigger the lytic reactivation, cells were crosslinked and subjected for chromatin isolation and sonication. ChIP assay was performed using anti-H4R3sym antibody

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
