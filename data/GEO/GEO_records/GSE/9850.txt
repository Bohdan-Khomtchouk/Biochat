TITLE
Wild type vs glnPA double mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
This microarray experiment is part of a study addressing the importance of glutamine metabolism in Streptococcus pneumoniae for the virulence of this bacterium. To be able to gain more insight into the phenotype of a double mutant of glnA (TIGR 4 locus tag SP0502, encoding glutamine synthetase) and glnP (SP1241, encoding a permease component of a glutmine uptake ABC transporter), the transcriptome of this mutant, the glnPA double mutant, was determined in strain S. pneumoniae D39 grown in rich GM17 medium with 0.5 mg/ml glutamine. This revealed a big change in transcriptome in the mutant, especially a lot of amino acid and peptide metabolic genes. Keywords: transcriptome analysis of D39 wild-type compared with its isogenic glnPA double mutant

DESIGN
The wild-type strain D39 and its isogenic glnPA double mutant were grown in 4 biological replicates in GM17 with 0.5 mg/ml glutamine to an Optical Density at 600 nm of 0.3. From these cultures samples were prepared for transciptome determination with in-house printed microarrays covering the genomes of several S. pneumoniae species. The wild-type (control, Ch1) was labeled with Cy5 (3 samples) or Cy3 (1 sample) and vice versa for the samples of the glnPA mutant (target, Ch2). Samples were pair-wise compared on glass-microarray slides.
