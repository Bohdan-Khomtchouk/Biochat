TITLE
Age-dependent gene expression in isolated small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from total small intestine of each four 3- and 21-day-old C57BL/6 mice (protocol according to: Lotz et al., J. Exp. Med. 2006). Each two 3- and 21-day-old animals were obtained from one litter. Total RNA was isolated by TriZol and ist purity was examined using a Bioanalyszer. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in primary total isolated intestinal epithelial cells of 3- versus 21-day-old mice.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates from isolated intestinal epithelial cells obtained from 3- and 21-day-old mice (each two animals from one litter). Colour change.
