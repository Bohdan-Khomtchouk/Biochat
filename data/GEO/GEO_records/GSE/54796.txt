TITLE
Gene regulation by Sox9 in the conjunctival epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type or Sox9 fx/fx; Le-Cre-positive (Sox9-/-) conjunctival epithelium from the temporal, nasal and dorsal region of E14.5 mouse embryos was laser micodissected from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three Sox9 knockout embryos were used. cDNA obtained from each region of the conjunctival epithelium was pooled and used for microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the values from the 25-50 beads on each array.
