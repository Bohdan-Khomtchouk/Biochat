TITLE
Studies of canine breed development on the island of Sardinia recapitulate genomic features of human population isolates [CANE]

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The Italian island of Sardinia is well known in studies of human population isolates. It is also home to the Fonni's Dog, a breed of canine whose development was reliant on the functionality of the dog. Using genome-wide variant and sequence analyses, we have characterized the Fonni's Dog relative to 27 other dog breeds from the Mediterranean region. We determine introgression events relevant to Mediterranean breed development and describe how the Fonni's dog presents an intriguing model demonstrating the characteristics of traditional human population isolates and, in particular, exhibiting the unique demographic composition of the people of Sardinia.

DESIGN
4 canine samples representing 1 dog breed
