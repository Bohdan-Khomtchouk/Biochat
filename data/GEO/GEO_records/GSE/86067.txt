TITLE
Antitumor effect of FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 on B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found that small moleculal weight FOXO1 inhibitor has antitumor affect  against BCP-ALL cell lines RS4;11 and UoCB6

DESIGN
BCP-ALL cell lines RS4;11 and UoCB6  were treated with  AS1842856 at concentations of 40 and 80 nM, respectively.24 h later total RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Microarray analyses were performed using 200 ng of total RNA as starting material and 5.5 µg ssDNA per hybridization (GeneChip Fluidics Station 450; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The total RNAs were amplified and labeled following the Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay ( ). Labeled ssDNA was hybridized to Human Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The  chips were scanned with a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and subsequent images analyzed using Affymetrix® Expression Console Software (Affymetrix). Probe level data were obtained using the robust multichip average (RMA) normalization algorithm.
