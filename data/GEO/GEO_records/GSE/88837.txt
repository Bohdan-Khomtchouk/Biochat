TITLE
Analysis of obesity-induced gene expression changes in visceral adipose tisssue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to use global gene expression to identify obesity-induced changes in gene expression profiles of lean and obese adolescent females. Visceral adipose tissue was extracted during abdominal surgeries on Lean and Obese adolescent females of african-americam, caucasian, and hispanic descent.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from human visceral adipose of obese and lean adolescent females. GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were utilized to explore gene expression profiles.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
