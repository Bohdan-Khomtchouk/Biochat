TITLE
Auxin-mediated gene expression in WT, iaa17, axr3 and iaa5iaa6iaa19 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global gene expression data from 7-day old light-grown liquid cultured seedlings treated with or without auxin (5ï¿½M IAA) for 2 h. Columbia (WT), IAA17 loss of function mutant allele (iaa17-2), IAA17 gain of function mutant allele (axr3-1) and iaa5 iaa6 iaa19 triple loss of function mutant allele (i5i6i19) were used for this study. Each experimental condition has three true replicates for a total of 24 hybridizations. Data Keywords: parallel sample
