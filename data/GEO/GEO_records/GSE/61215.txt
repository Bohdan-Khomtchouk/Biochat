TITLE
Comparison of human NK and T cell microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the levels of expression of hundreds of mature miRNA's on an arrray (miRCURY, Exiqon, Cophenhagen, DN) for primary human T cells and NK cells. We found a 4% difference in the level of expression between these two cell types.

DESIGN
NK and T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection  from three healthy adult individuals, and total RNA was harvested. Samples reverse transcribed and studied on a microarry (miRCURY, Exiqon)

PLATFORM
GPL19165 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA Array (miRBASE 14.0, lot numbers 31015 and 31078)  [condensed ProbeID version]
