TITLE
Comparison of human NK and T cell microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the levels of expression of hundreds of mature miRNA's on an arrray (miRCURY, Exiqon, Cophenhagen, DN) for primary human T cells and NK cells. We found a 4% difference in the level of expression between these two cell types.
