TITLE
Targeting FAK and EGFR/HER-2 with small molecule inhibitors in SKBR-3 breast cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeting FAK with two different FAK inhibitors and Lapatinib demonstrated different signaling mechanisms

DESIGN
SKBR-3 cells were treated with inhibitors for 24 hours at 1 microM of Fak inhibitors (either Y15 or PF04554878, 5 microM Lapatinib or by combination of Fak inhibitor and Lapatinib at these doses. The Gene expression profiles were compared between the groups
