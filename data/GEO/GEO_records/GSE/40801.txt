TITLE
Expression analysis of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hAVICs), mitral valve interstitial cells(hMVICs) and dermal firbroblasts (hDFs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in hAVICs and hMVICs, compared to human dermal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
A three chip assay using total RNA obtained from primary cultured normal valve interstital cells and human dermal fibroblasts was performed. Each chip measures the expression level of 45,033 genes from normal AVICs,MVICs and DFs.
