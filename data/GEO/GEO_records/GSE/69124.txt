TITLE
Changes in gene expression caused by loss of Med1 in the mouse prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MED1 is a transcriptional coactivator for gene-specific activators involved in growth and development, we were interested in identifying MED1 target genes potentially involved in prostate development by cDNA microarray. Med1 was conditional knocked out in mice prostate. We performed cDNA microarray with two sets: (1) RNA isolated from three WT ventral prostates and three MT ventral prostates; (2) RNA isolated from three WT lateral prostates and three MT lateral prostates. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying how Med1 was involved in mice prostate development by regulating targeted genes expression

DESIGN
12 mice prostate samples were divided into two groups: (1) three WT ventral prostates and three MT ventral prostates; (2) three WT lateral prostates and three MT lateral prostates.
