TITLE
Time course analysis of gene expression in BCR-stimulated splenic wild type and TAK1-/- B cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The activation signaling of transcription factor nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) plays central role for immune system.  One of key kinase mediating this pathway is TAK1 in adaptive and innate immunity. However, role of TAK1 in B cell receptor signaling is still unclear. To know effects of TAK1-deletion on the gene expression induced by anti-IgM, we performed the time course analysis in comparison of wild type with TAK1-deleted splenic B cells.

DESIGN
Splenic B cells were purified by depleting CD43+ cells. Purified B Cells were stimulated with 10 Âµg/ml of anti-IgM for 1, 3, 6, or 24hr.  Two replicated samples were analysed. Unstimulated cells (0) were control.
