TITLE
A Novel Role for Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in Exercise-Induced Improvements in Glucose Homeostasis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exercise training improves whole body glucose homeostasis through effects largely attributed to adaptations in skeletal muscle; however, training also affects other tissues including adipose tissue. To determine if exercise-induced adaptations to adipose tissue contribute to training-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) from trained or sedentary donor mice was transplanted into the visceral cavity of sedentary recipients. Remarkably, nine days post-transplantation, mice receiving trained scWAT had improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin sensitivity compared to mice transplanted with sedentary scWAT or sham-treated mice. Mice transplanted with trained scWAT had increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in tibialis anterior and soleus muscles and brown adipose tissue, suggesting that the transplanted scWAT exerted endocrine effects. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of high-fat feeding on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were completely reversed if high-fat fed recipient mice were transplanted with trained scWAT. In additional experiments, voluntary exercise training by wheel running for only 11 days resulted in profound changes in scWAT including increased expression of âˆ¼1550 genes involved in numerous cellular functions, including metabolism. Exercise training causes adaptations to scWAT that elicit metabolic improvements in other tissues, demonstrating a previously unrecognized role for adipose tissue in the beneficial effects of exercise on systemic glucose homeostasis.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of scWAT obtained from a cohort of mice that were housed in wheel cages for 11 days compared to sedentary control mice.
