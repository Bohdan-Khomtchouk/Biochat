TITLE
Combinatorial activities of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE and FLOWERING LOCUS C define distinct modes of flowering regulation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The MADS-box transcription factors FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) are major transcriptional repressors controlling flowering time. They enhance responses to environmental cues such as winter temperatures, high ambient temperatures and photoperiod, acting at least in part by blocking transcription of the floral pathway integrators. As other MADS-box transcription factors, FLC and SVP can interact in vivo forming multimeric complexes. Mutations in either FLC or SVP lead to similar early flowering, suggesting that FLC-SVP interaction might be the major control unit. Here we have analyzed the coordinated regulatory modes of these two key transcription factors at a genome-wide level through ChIP-seq and gene expression microarrays. Genome-wide identification of SVP and FLC DNA-binding occupancy events revealed that their binding scenarios are strongly yet differently affected by the presence of the cognate partner both at a quantitative as well as a qualitative level. Also, we identified a subgroup of genes whose regulation exclusively depends on the combinatorial binding of these two proteins, strengthening the role of the SVP-FLC complex. Some of these genes are involved in the control of flowering through direct and indirect regulation of Gibberellin-related genes such as GA2ox8, DDF1 and TEM1. Interestingly, we identified cis-regulatory elements enriched uniquely at complex-bound sites. This study decoded the regulatory code mediated by the major flowering repressors SVP and FLC.
