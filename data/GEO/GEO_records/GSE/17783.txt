TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in FACS-purified cortical projection neurons using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3 subtypes of cortical projection neurons were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at 4 different stages of development from mouse cortex. A detailed description of the data set is described in Arlotta, P et al (2005) and Molyneaux, BJ et al (2009). The hybridization cocktails used here were originally applied to the Affymetrix mouse 430A arrays and submitted as GEO accession number GSE2039. The same hybridization cocktails were then applied to the Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays, and those data are contained in this series.

DESIGN
Three subtypes of cortical neurons were purified by FACS at multiple stages of mouse brain development. The neuron subtypes are: corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), callosal projection neurons (CPN), and corticotectal projection neurons (CTPN). The stages of development included embryonic day 18 (E18), postnatal day 3 (P3), postnatal day 6 (P6), and postnatal day 14 (P14). CSMN and CPN were analyzed at all four stages, while CTPN were only analyzed at P14. The replicates included in the data set are all true biological replicates with independent sample collection for each.
