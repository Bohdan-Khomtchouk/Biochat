TITLE
Hepatic gene expression data from cadmium-exposed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Environmental cadmium, with a high average dietary intake, is a severe public health risk. However, the long-term health implications of environmental exposure to cadmium in different life stages remain unclear. We used microarrays to explore the effects of early exposure to low-dose cadmium on hepatic gene expression.

DESIGN
Female and male mice were continuously exposed by water or cadmium from the initial stage of life. At the later stage of life, the liver were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to find the effect of long-term cadmium exposure on hepatic gene expression and the gender difference.
