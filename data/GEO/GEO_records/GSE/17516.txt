TITLE
Orthotopic Xenograft Model of Ependymoma that Maintains Genomic Signature of the Primary Tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis was that the orthotopic xenograft model of ependymoma faithfully recapitulate the genomics signatures of the original tumor patient tissue

DESIGN
Original tumor cells were implanted into the same location of SCID mice and check for transcriptome profiles upon subsequent passages to show that the passages preserve the overall genomics signature of the original tumor tissue.
