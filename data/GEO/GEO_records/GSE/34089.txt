TITLE
Regulation of Energy Metabolism by the Extracytoplasmic Function (ECF) σ factors of Arcobacter butzleri

ORGANISM
Arcobacter butzleri RM4018

SUMMARY
The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors are fundamental for bacterial adaptation to distinct environments and for survival under different stress conditions. The emerging pathogen Arcobacter butzleri possesses seven putative pairs of σ/anti-σ factors belonging to the ECF family. Here, we report the identification of the genes regulated by five out of the seven A. butzleri ECF σ factors. Three of the ECF σ factors play an apparent role in transport, energy generation and the maintainance of redox balance. Several genes like the nap, sox and tct genes are regulated by more than one ECF σ factor indicating that the A. butzleri ECF σ factors form a network of overlapping regulons. In contrast to other eubacteria, these A. butzleri ECF regulons appear to primarily regulate responses to changing environments in order to meet metabolic needs instead of an obvious role in stress adaptation.

DESIGN
Eleven condition experiment, wild-type A. butzleri and 10 mutants.  Three replicates for isolates RM4810, RM4810∆Aσ1::Km, RM4018Δσ1/Aσ1::Km, RM4810∆Aσ2::Km, RM4018∆σ2/Aσ2::Km, RM4018∆Aσ4::Km, RM4018∆σ4/Aσ4::Km, RM4018∆Aσ5::Km, RM4018∆σ5/Aσ5::Km, RM4018∆Aσ7::Km, and RM4018Δσ7/Aσ7::Km independently grown in BHI and incubated at 30°C on a shaking platform set at 150 rpm. RNA was isolated from 5 ml of mid-logarithmic phase cultures (OD550 of approximately 0.5).  A type 2 gene expression experimental design was used, with fluorescently labeled genomic DNA as a reference channel in each experiment as described by Lucchini, S., et al. 2005.
