TITLE
Gene expression profile of MRKHS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of vaginal cells isolated from MRKHS patients, compared with those without MRKHS, presented alterations of developmental genes such as HOXB family, the Notch ligands JAG1 and DLL1 and MUC1, which can represent key elements in the pathogenesis of MRKHS, thus suggesting a potential alteration of networks involved in the formation of the female reproductive tract.

DESIGN
This study included sixteen MRKHS patients, diagnosed by clinical examination, trans abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and/or vaginoscopy, that underwent reconstruction of neovagina in the Department of Gynecologic-Obstetrical and Urologic Sciences of Sapienza University of Rome between 2007 and 2011, and five control subjects with no known reproductive tract defects or developmental malformations. 8 patients and 5 controls were analyzed using Illumina beadarray.
