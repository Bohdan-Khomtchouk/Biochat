TITLE
Gene expression changes induced by the pan-PIM inhibitor ETP-39010 in 4 peripheral T cell lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a very aggressive disease which currently lacks efficient targeted therapy. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the very poor outcome of these patients. In these study we hypothesized that PIM kinases could be of therapeutic value in PTCL because we found an overexpression of PIM1 and PIM2, but not PIM3, in PTCL cases, cell lines and primary tumoral T cells from Sezary Syndrome patients, compared with reactive lymph nodes and normal T cells from healthy donors, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of action of this pan-PIM inhibitor in PTCL, 4 cell lines (DERL7, HuT78, SR786 and MyLa) were treated with 10 μM of ETP-39010 for 0, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 24 h, and gene expression profiling was performed.

DESIGN
4 PTCL cell lines (DERL7, HuT78, SR786 and MyLa) were treated with DMSO and 10 μM of the pan-PIM inhibitor ETP-39010, and hybridized using the Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as the reference sample.
