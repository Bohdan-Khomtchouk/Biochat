TITLE
Grass shrimp SAGE libraries

ORGANISM
Palaemon pugio

SUMMARY
Adult male grass shrimp were exposed for 96 hours to LC50 concentrations of either Fipronil, Endosulfan, or Cadmium, as well as a Carrier Control exposure.  RNA was extracted from whole-body homogenates using the RNABee kit.  Tags were clustered to identify tags diagnostic of the different exposures. Keywords: SAGE, Grass shrimp, ecotoxicogenomics

DESIGN
3 randomly selected shrimp were pooled for each library.  Libraries were constructed using the I-SAGE long kit from Invitrogen.
