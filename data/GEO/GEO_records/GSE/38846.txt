TITLE
Functional control of the Candida albicans cell wall by catalytic protein kinase A subunit Tpk1

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The cyclic AMP-protein kinase A pathway has a central role in the biology of Candida albicans, a prominent fungal pathogen of humans. The two catalytic subunits for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, Tpk1 (orf19.4892) and Tpk2 (orf19.2277), have divergent roles, and most studies indicate a more pronounced role for Tpk2. Here we dissect two Tpk1-responsive properties: adherence and cell wall integrity. Homozygous tpk1/tpk1 mutants are hyperadherent, and a Tpk1 defect enables biofilm formation in the absence of Bcr1, a central transcriptional regulator of biofilm adhesins. Microarray analysis revealed an enrichment for cell wall and surface functions among Tpk1-repressed genes, and overexpression of individual target genes indicates that cell surface proteins Als1, Als2, Als4, Csh1, and Csp37 contribute to Tpk1-regulated adherence. Tpk1 is also required for cell wall integrity, but has no role in the cell wall integrity gene expression response. Interestingly, increased expression of the adhesin gene ALS2 conferred a cell wall defect, as manifested in hypersensitivity to the cell wall inhibitor caspofungin and a shallow cell wall structure. Our findings indicate that Tpk1 has a central role in C. albicans cell wall properties that is exerted through repression of select cell surface protein genes.
