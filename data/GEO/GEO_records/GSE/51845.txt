TITLE
Effect of MCMV infection on gene expression in ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 arrays were performed on total RNA obtained from ovaries of 5 female mice (pregnant or non-pregnant; mock or MCMV infection). Mice were infected 9.5 days post conception with 2x10e05 PFU MCMV i.v.. RNA was prepared at 5 days post infection (14.5 days post conception).

DESIGN
Total RNA prepared from ovaries of 5 mice per condition was pooled and subjected to microarray analysis. Data were normalised using RMA.
