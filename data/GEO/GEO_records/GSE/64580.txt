TITLE
Differential alteration of the transcriptome upon plakophilin3 loss in HCT116 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand alterations in gene expression upon plakophilin3 (PKP3) loss, we generated two HCT116 derived plakophilin3 knockdown clones. One of these clones named shpkp3-2 was used for the experiment. The gene expression profile of shpkp3-2 was compared with the vector control named vec.

DESIGN
RNA used for this experiment was obtained from two biological replicates of vec (vec1 and vec2) and shpkp3-2 (shpkp3-2-1 and  shpkp3-2-2). RNA from the clones were obtained at separate time points in 2 groups. The first group was vec1 and shpkp3-2-1 and the second group was of  clones vec2 and shpkp3-2-2, respectively.
