TITLE
Zac1 is a regulator of the imprinted gene network (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the imprinted transcription factor Zac1 targets, we overexpressed Zac1 in a mouse insulinoma cell line and measured  the regulated expressed genes by RNA-seq. We have shown that Zac1 regulates many genes belonging to the Imprinted Gene Network, including genes coding for the extra-cellular matrix.

DESIGN
Determination of Zac1 target genes in transfected Min6 cells (4 biological replicates) using RNA-seq, .

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
