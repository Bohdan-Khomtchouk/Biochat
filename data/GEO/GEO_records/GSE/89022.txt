TITLE
Gene expression in the peripheral whole blood of established Type 1 diabetes patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was performed to measure gene expression in peripheral whole blood RNA samples of established Type 1 diabetics.

DESIGN
Whole blood RNA samples of 10 established Type 1 diabetes patients were provided by TrialNet.  Samples were collected in Tempus tubes (Applied Biosystems) and RNA was extracted using the Kingfisher Purification system (Thermo Scientific). Total RNA concentrations were determined and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Reagent Kit (Agilent).  One color microarray analysis was performed using the SurePrint G3 Human Gene expression 8Ã—60K one-color microarray kit (Agilent Technologies) and the Low input QuickAmp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to manufacturer's instructions.

PLATFORM
