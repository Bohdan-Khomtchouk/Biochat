TITLE
Expression data from melanoma xenograft tumors originating from primary immortalized melanocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PREX2 truncating mutations occur in melanoma. We used microarray based gene expression profiling to compare expression patterns between xenografts harboring control GFP, wt PREX2 or various human relevant PREX2 mutants

DESIGN
Primary xenograft tumors derived from primary immortalized melanocytes expressing indicated constructs were grown in ncr-nude mice and tumors harvested before before reaching 1.5cm size
