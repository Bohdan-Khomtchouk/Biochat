TITLE
Four weeks expression data of the antipsychotics Clozapine and Haloperidol in the mouse brain (Affymetrix, GCRMA).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atypical antipsychotic Clozapine has a superior antipsychotic and antimanic effects compared to other antisphicotics. Its widespread use was limited by the side effects of agranulocytosis, cardiomyopathy and metabolic anomalies such as weight gain, and diabetes. Very little is known about mechanisms by which Clozapine works. The aim of this experiment is to compare the chronic gene expression profile (i.e four weeks) of the atypical antipsychotic Clozapine to the typical antipsychotic drug Haloperidol using gene expression Microarray in order to understand the intercellular mechanism behind the therapeutic and the toxic effects of Clozapine. Keywords: drug response
