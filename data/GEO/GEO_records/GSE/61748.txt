TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Foxj3 or Zbtb18 stable expressed embryonic stem (ES) cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the specific mechanism by which Foxj3 and Zbtb18 control RA-induced neural directional differentiation of ESCs, total mRNAs of Foxj3-ES and Zbtb18-ES were extracted and used for RNA seq and transcriptome analyses. Compared with the control, 1331 genes were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) by twofold in Foxj3-ES (557 were underexpressed and 774 were overexpressed), and 1175 genes were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) by twofold in Zbtb18-ESCs (548 were underexpressed and 627 were overexpressed). Through Gene ontology and gene co-expression network analysis, we identified four critical genes in the neural regulatory networks: Olig1, Zic5, Erbb2, and Olig2. Our study shows that Foxj3 and Zbtb18 could trigger the gene regulatory networks of neurodevelopment by mediating the expression of Olig1, Zic5, Erbb2, and Olig2.
