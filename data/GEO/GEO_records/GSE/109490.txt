TITLE
Functional modulation of gene expression by TUC338 during growth of human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the molecular interactions of an ultraconserved non-coding RNA, TUC338, which is highly upregulated in hepatocellular cancer and implicated in growth regulation. We have identified functional genomic and proteomic determinants of this lncRNA involved in modulation of gene expression.

DESIGN
Investigate the molecular interactions of TUC338
