TITLE
Genome-Wide Expression Profiling of human tumor-infiltrating microglia/macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microglia isolated from glioma patients gain anti-tumor activities upon poly (I:C) stimulation.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of human tumor-infiltrating microglia/macrophages before (untreated) and after treatment with poly (I:C) for 48h (induced). Tumor-infiltrating microglia/macrophages were isolated from freshly excised brain tumors

PLATFORM
