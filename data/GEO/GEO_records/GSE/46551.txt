TITLE
Consequences of perinatal bisphenol A exposure in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease influenced by genetic and environmental contributing factors.  Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as bisphenol A (BPA) affect gene expression and hormone-regulated systems throughout the body.  We investigated the effects of BPA on Theilerâ€™s-virus induced demyelination (TVID), a mouse model of MS.  Perinatal BPA exposure, combined with viral infection, resulted in a decreased level of viral antibodies, accelerated the onset of TVID symptoms, increased inflammation in both the spinal cord and digestive tract, and amplified immune-related gene expression changes induced by viral infection. These results demonstrate the effect of BPA on the trajectory of TVID, and illustrate how multiple factors collectively influence autoimmune disease.
