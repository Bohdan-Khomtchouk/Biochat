TITLE
IL-15 sustains IL-7R independent ILC2 and ILC3 development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ILC3 contain 3 well-defined subsets, CCR6+ ILC3, NKp46+ ILC3, and CCR6–NKp46– DN ILC3. These subsets had not previously been transcriptionally compared and the extent to which they had shared or unique transcriptional profiles remained unclear. We used microarray to determine transcriptional differences between these 3 subsets and to find putative factors that support the survival of CCR6+ ILC3 during cytokine depletion.

DESIGN
ILC3 subsets were sorted from small intestine lamina propria, for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
