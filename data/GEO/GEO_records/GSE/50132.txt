TITLE
Implication of small sperm RNAs in the inheritance of the effect of early traumatic stress in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been proposed as potential vectors of the interface between genes and environment. Here, we report that environmental conditions involving traumatic stress in early life, alter miRNA and piRNA composition in sperm of adult males in mice.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA content of sperm from males, that experienced early chronic stress during their first two weeks of life versus small RNA content of sperm from control males.

PLATFORM
