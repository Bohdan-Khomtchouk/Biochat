TITLE
miRNA expression of gefitinib-resistant cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNAs involved in acquired EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC, genome-wide miRNA expression analysis was performed in gefitinib-resistant sub-cell lines and gefitinib-sensitive parental cell lines.

DESIGN
Gefitinib-resistant sub-cell lines were generated by growing gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines (PC9 and HCC827) in increasing concentrations of gefitinib to a final concentration of 10 uM up to 6 months.
