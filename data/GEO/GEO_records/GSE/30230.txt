TITLE
Heterobasidion irregulare gene expression from different tissues and mycelium grown on different substrates

ORGANISM
Heterobasidion annosum

SUMMARY
Transcript profiles of Heterobasion irregulare from different tissues and mycelium grown on different substrates were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, department of energy) Heterobasidion annosum genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models under various conditions. Another goal was to compare gene expression profiles from different tissues of Heterobasidion irregulare and from mycelium grown on liquid MMN medium, liquid medium amended with lignin or cellulose and on wood.
