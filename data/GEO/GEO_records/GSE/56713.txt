TITLE
Expression profile of bcl11b-deficient cd8 T cells during immune response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Review on the role of Bcl11b in thymus and periphery and impact on immune diseases

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells purified from bcl11bf/flckd-cre and wild type mice were infected with Listeria monocytogenes and on day 6 mice were sacrificed and Cd8+ T cells were purified at more than 90% purity. The RNA was purified with trizol and submitted for generation of library and microarrays to establish genes which are regulated in infected KO versus WT cytotoxic T cells.
