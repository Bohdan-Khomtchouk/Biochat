TITLE
Expression data from 11-day-old antisense BoEMF2.1 broccoli

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea var. italica

SUMMARY
EMF2 genes play an important function in inhibiting reproductive programs during vegetative stage of plant development. We knocked down the expression of endogenous EMF2 genes in broccoli by introduing a 35S::antisenseBoEMF2.1 contruct. The transgenic broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2s showed aberrant phenotypes during development. We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression and to identified genes misexpressed in broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2 genes

DESIGN
11-day-old seedlings of broccoli harboring the empty vector pCAMBIA1380 and that harboring 35S::antisenseBoEMF2.1 (asBoEMF2.1) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
