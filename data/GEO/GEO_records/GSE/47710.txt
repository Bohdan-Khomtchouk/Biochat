TITLE
Porcine gene response following incision with energized devices

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study compares the gene expression changes in Sus scrofa in response to two different methods for abdominal surgical incisions ; electrosurgery and harmonic blade. As the use of laparoscopic surgery has become more widespread in recent years, the need has increased for minimally-invasive surgical devices that effectively cut and coagulate tissue with reduced tissue trauma. Although electrosurgery (ES) has been used for many generations, newly-developed ultrasonic devices (HARMONICÂ® Blade, HB) have been shown at a macroscopic level to offer better coagulation with less thermally-induced tissue damage. We sought to understand the differences between ES and HB at a microscopic level by comparing mRNA transcript and protein responses at the 3-day timepoint to incisions made by the devices in subcutaneous fat tissue in a porcine model

DESIGN
This study used four 4-cm midline caudal abdominal incisions created with the test devices in two female pigs.  The test devices were monopolar electrosurgery and Harmonic blade. Each animal had two Harmonic Blade incisions and two Electrosurgery incisions for a total of 8 incisions
