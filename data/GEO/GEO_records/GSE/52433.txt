TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver over-expressing either GFP alone or biotinylated-TRb1 and GFP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We over-expressed biotinylated-thyroid hormone receptor beta 1 (TRb1) in mouse liver using an adenovirus in order to perform ChIP-seq experiments. These microarrays were performed to determine gene expression changes in response to tri-iodothyronine (thyroid hormone; T3) stimulation. A control GFP adenovirus was used and gene expression from these livers was also done as a comparison. We performed microarrays from Ad-GFP-infected propylthiouracil (PTU)-fed livers injected with either saline or T3 and Ad-TRb1-GFP infected livers injected with either saline or T3.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from livers of biotin ligase (BirA)-expressing mice that had been infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-TRb1, fed with PTU for 3 weeks followed by saline or T3 injections for 4 consecutive days.
