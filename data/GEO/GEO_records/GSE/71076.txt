TITLE
Cbx8 acts non-canonically with Wdr5 to promote mammary tumorigenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that in MMTV-Myc cells (1) MS culture enriches for aggressive breast cancer cells compared to the bulk cells, (2) Cbx8 knockdown reduces Notch-network gene expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression of (1) bulk vs MS MMTV-Myc cells, (2) control vs Cbx8 knockdown MMTV-Myc cells

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
