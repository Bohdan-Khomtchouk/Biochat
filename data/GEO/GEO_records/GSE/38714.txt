TITLE
Gene expression profile in bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC3, following growth in bone marrow conditioned medium (BMCM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine initial genetic changes in the prostate cancer cells following migration to skeleton

DESIGN
PC3 cells grown in three dimensional spheroids on hubiogel matrices were cultured for 10 days in BMCM obtained from immunocompetent C57/BL6 mouse. Total RNA was isolated from these PC3 spheroids and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis.
