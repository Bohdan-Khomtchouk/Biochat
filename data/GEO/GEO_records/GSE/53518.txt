TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of livers obtained from 2-stage carcinogenesis model in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of epigenetic alterations in the early stage of carcinogenesis promises a great contribution for mechanism analysis and marker exploration for the drug development. For this purpose, we conducted comprehensive analyses for DNA methylation and gene expression in livers obtained from a rat 2-stage carcinogenesis study using nitrosodiethylamine, thioacetamide, methapyrilene and acetaminophen as an initiator and phenobarbital as a promoter. Here, we report the result of MeDIP-seq using methylated DNA enriched by MBD2-protein in rat livers. Comprehensive gene expression analysis was also conducted using same liver samples. The obtained tag sequences were mapped onto rat genome and arbitrary tag count values were calculated and used as each gene DNA methylation state. Using these methylation and gene expression data, pathway analyses for each treatment was performed. The data indicated that livers accompanying preneoplastic legions acquired carcinogenic character of DNA methylation and immune-response related pathways were affected.

DESIGN
DNA methylation status of livers obtained from 2-stage carcinogenesis model in rats. Examination of 2 different histone modifications in 2 cell types. This submission represents the DNA methylation component of study.
