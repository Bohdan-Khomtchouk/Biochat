TITLE
Iron regulation in Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

SUMMARY
Vibrio vulnificus multiply rapidly in host tissues under iron overloaded conditions. To understand the effects of iron in the physiology of this pathogen we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of this bacterium growing under three different iron concentrations. V.vulnificus CMCP6 cells were grown under three different iron concentrations (TSBS + EDDA 50uM, TSBS and TSBS + FAC 250 ug/ml) and samples taken at log phase. Keywords: Response to the iron concentration of the media

DESIGN
Strains were grown to an OD600nm of 0.6 to 0.8 in TSBS, TSBS with the addition of 250 μg/ml FAC or TSBS with the addition of 50 μM EDDA. Three independent cultures of the V. vulnificus cells grown in each media, were combined and treated as a single sample for the RNA extraction to minimize culture variation. Two samples per condition were used for the microarray analysis. Cells were centrifuged and the pellets resuspended in RNAWiz reagent (Ambion®, Austin, TX). Total RNA was extracted from each strain according to the manufacturer’s instructions
