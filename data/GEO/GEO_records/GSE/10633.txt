TITLE
Iron regulation in Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

SUMMARY
Vibrio vulnificus multiply rapidly in host tissues under iron overloaded conditions. To understand the effects of iron in the physiology of this pathogen we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of this bacterium growing under three different iron concentrations. V.vulnificus CMCP6 cells were grown under three different iron concentrations (TSBS + EDDA 50uM, TSBS and TSBS + FAC 250 ug/ml) and samples taken at log phase. Keywords: Response to the iron concentration of the media
