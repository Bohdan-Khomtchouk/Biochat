TITLE
Circadian transcriptome of fast tibialis anterior (TA) and slow soleus (SOL) skeletal muscles from muscle-specific Bmal1 KO and control Cre- littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 in skeletal muscle, we compared the circadian transcriptomes of fast tibialis anterior (TA) and slow soleus (SOL) skeletal muscles from muscle-specific Bmal1 KO (mKO) and their control Cre- littermates (Ctrl). Keyword: Circadian Transcriptome, time course

DESIGN
72 samples were analyzed, comprised of 4 experimental groups (Ctrl SOL, mKO SOL, Ctrl TA, mKO TA), with 3 biological replicates for each time point sampled every 4 hours for 24 hours. SOL and TA muscles were collected from the same animals, as indicated by Source Animal ID data column
