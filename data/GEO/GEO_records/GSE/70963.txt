TITLE
Brain gene expression associated with visual pattern learning in Polistes metricus paper wasps

ORGANISM
Polistes metricus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to analyze genome-wide brain gene expression during facial and pattern training for P. metricus. Furthermore, we investigated whether social environment affected a worker's facial learning ability and brain gene expression.

DESIGN
PRJNA287152; We sequenced total RNA from 16 individual Polistes metricus adult brains from 4 groups: foundresses trained to faces (n=4), foundresses trained to patterns (n=4), workers reared on non-natal conspecific nest and trained to faces (n=4), workers reared on non-natal allospecific (P. fuscatus) nest and trained to faces (n=4).
