TITLE
Left-right transcriptomic differences in adult male mouse heart atria

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Left and right heart atria of adult male mice were profiled to determine the differences in gene expression, control, coordination and signaling fabrics

DESIGN
Two-sides (L= left, R = right) gene expression profiling experiment in adult mouse male (M) atria (A). 4 biological replicates: MAL1-4, MAR1-4. This experiment used our standard multiple yellow strategy in which Cy3 and Cy5 labeled biological replicates are cohybridized with a two-color array and each channel is processed independently.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
