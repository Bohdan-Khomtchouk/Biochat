TITLE
Sodium butyrate induced gene expression changes in the Madin-Darby bovine kidney epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The Madin-Darby bovine kidney epithelial cells, when at approximately 50% confluence (during the exponential phase), were treated with 10mM sodium butyrate for 24h.  Butyrate induced profound changes in gene expression related with multiple signal transduction pathways such as cell cycle control, apoptosis and extracellular matrix remodeling in this cell line Keywords: stress response, two class unpaired design

DESIGN
Six single channel hybridizations were performed (treated vs control), 3 replicates each.
