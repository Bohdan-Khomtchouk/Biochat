TITLE
nc886, a TGF-β-induced non-coding RNA, suppresses the microRNA pathway in ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulatory components in cancer. Usually in advanced malignant stages, TGF-β signaling is elevated, but global miRNA expression is suppressed. Such a gene expression signature is well illustrated in a fibrosis/mesenchymal subtype of ovarian cancer (OC) that is of poor prognosis. However, the interplay between the two pathways in the OC subtype has not yet been elucidated. nc886 is a recently identified non-coding RNA implicated in several malignancies. nc886's high expression is associated with the poor prognosis of 285 patients in an OC cohort. Herein we have found in OC that nc886 expression is induced by TGF-β and that nc886 binds to the enzyme Dicer to inhibit the processing of miRNA precursors into mature forms. By preventing the miRNA pathway, nc886 emulates TGF-β in gene expression patterns and potentiates cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. We report nc886 as a novel molecular link between the TGF-β and miRNA pathways.
