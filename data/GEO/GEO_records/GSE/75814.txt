TITLE
CDK7 Inhibition Suppresses Melanoma Growth By Depleting A Super-enhancer Associated " Achilles " Lineage Cluster [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) lacks targeted therapies beyond the oft-circumvented BRAF inhibitors.  Part of the difficulty in treating melanomas has been attributed to a strong survival program controlled by melanocyte transcription factors such as MITF - a phenomenon first described in melanoma as “lineage dependency.”  Recently, a highly selective covalent CDK7 inhibitor (THZ1) has been shown to potently suppress the growth of various cancers through the depletion of master transcription-regulating oncogenes and the disruption of their attendant super-enhancers.  We now show that melanoma cells are highly sensitive to CDK7 inhibition and that a melanocyte “lineage cluster,” whose members are transcriptionally driven by super-enhancers, is also strongly suppressed by THZ1.  These results point to CDK7 inhibition as a viable strategy to deprive oncogenic transcription and suppress tumor growth in melanoma.
