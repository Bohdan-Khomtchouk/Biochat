TITLE
Gene expression signatures in heart tissues of mice simulating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [Study2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a PTSD mouse model, we investigated the longitudinal transcriptomic changes in heart tissues after the exposure to stress through intimidation

DESIGN
We designed our time-course study (Study II) with three experimental conditions where we varied the length of time that subservient mice were exposed to aggressor mice with the same length of rest time after the exposure (1day).  The conditions included were 1day-exposure (T1R1), 2day-exposure (T2R1) and 3day-exposure (T3R1).
