TITLE
Expression data from yeast with Anc1p or without under basal or MMS exposed conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of Anc1 deficient yeast under basal and MMS exposed conditions We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the MMS response in WT and Anc1 deficient yeast Keywords: dose

DESIGN
Yeast strains either WT or Anc1 deficient were exposed or unexposed to MMS
