TITLE
Expression data from lung metastasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of PGC1alpha in breast cancer lung metastasis is largely unknown. We used expression data from lung metastasis of mice injected with PGC1alpha overexpression or control cells to understand global changes that occur upon overexpression of PGC1alpha that lead to lung metastasis. We used expression data to understand the pathways and genes that may lead to lung metastasis in a PGC1alpha overexpression setting.

DESIGN
Mice were injected by tail vein with either PGC1alpha overexpressing or control  cells (NMuMG-ErbB2/PGC-1alpha and NMuMG-ErbB2/VC cells ) respectively. Mice were treated with phenformin for 1 week or PBS control. Lung metastasis was isolated by laser capture microdissection.
