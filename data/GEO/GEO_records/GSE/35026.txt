TITLE
Expression data in inguinal adipose tissue at different circadian times

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peripheral circadian clocks regulate many aspects of physiology. In this study we deleted the core circadian clock component Bmal1 specifically in mouse adipocytes in order to study the role of the adipocyte clock in energy homeostasis and body weight. We used microarrays to indentify changes in gene expression in the adipose tissue of mice lacking a functional adipocyte circadian clock and identified a small  number of up- and down- regulated genes.

DESIGN
Adipose tissues were isolated from inguinal adipose fat pads at four different times of the diurnal cycle under constant darkness (circadian time, CT) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Adipocyte-specific Bmal1 KO (Ad-Bmal1-/-) and control mice were used for isolation of tissues at CT0, CT6, CT12, CT18 where CT0 the beginning of the subjective day.
