TITLE
Metatranscriptomic analysis of an anaerobic ammonium oxidizing community dominated by Kuenenia stuttgartiensis

ORGANISM
Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis

SUMMARY
We compiled a metatranscriptome by extracting total RNA (including ribosomes), reverse transcription and solexa sequencing. We obtained quantitative data on the transcription of each orf to assess the importance of each orf to the metabolism of Kuenenia stuttgartiensis
