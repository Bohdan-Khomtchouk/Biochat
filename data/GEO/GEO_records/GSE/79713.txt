TITLE
Gene transcription profiles of spleen dentritic cells in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum in N day, 28 day, 63 day

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the biological function of dentritic cells, the whole  expression profile microarray was adopted to investigate genes of N,28-day, 63-d dentrtic cells how to develop a role of immune regulation besides a gene expression map.

DESIGN
In mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum, N-day, 28-day, 63-day spleen dentritic cells were sorted by flow cytometry, then RNA of the 3 timepoints was extracted for Agilent macroaary experiment.
