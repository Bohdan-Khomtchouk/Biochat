TITLE
Expression profiling of plants overexpressing transcription factor WIN1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
T2 progenies of two transgenic lines overexpressing ERF transcription factor WIN1 were grown on soil in parallel under identical conditions.  mRNA was extracted from pooled leaves from multiple plants of each line for the microarray experiement. Plants derived from two lines were used in this experiment: line 13, a " medium " overexpressor, and line 22, a strong overexpressor.  Control mRNA was obtained from pooled control plants transformed using an empty binary vector. All plants were first selected on medium containing kanamycin before being transferred to soil.
