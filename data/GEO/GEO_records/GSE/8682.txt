TITLE
Gene expression in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte tissue culture treated with tunicamycin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tunycamcin induces UPR/ISR and Inflammation in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte tissue culture. The early transcriptome changes were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to tunicamycin, to be compared with similar experiments with CLA as the treatment.  Their gene expression responses between 4 to 12 hr after treatment showed a common set of early gene expression changes indicative of a UPR/Inflammation stress response. Keywords: control/treatment time course
