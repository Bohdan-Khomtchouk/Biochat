SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Richard Sandstrom ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). At cell harvest, a subset of cells was stored at -20oC in RNALater.  Total RNA from 5 X 106 cells were purified using Ribopure (Ambion) according to vendor recommended protocols.  Total RNA quality was assessed on RNA 6000 Nano Chips (Agilent) using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).  Approximately 3ug of total RNA for each cell type was sent to the Center for Array Technology (CAT) for labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays.  Briefly, a Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay (Affymetrix) was used by the CAT to reduce the rRNA, perform in vitro transcription (IVT) and create labeled sense strand DNA for hybridization to the arrays.  Hybridizations were carried out according the manufacturers protocol.  Intensity files from the scanned exon arrays were sent to our lab for analysis at the exon level (Affymetrix ExACT 1.2.1 software). Samples were quantile normalized with PM-GCBG background correction and PLIER (Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error) summarized. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
