TITLE
Distinct lncRNA expression profiles in the distal end of sciatic nerve after peripheral nerve injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peripheral nerve injuries are common in modern society. The patients may suffer from partial or total loss of sensory, motor and autonomic function in the involved segments of the body. However, The molecular mechanisms of the regeneration program has not yet been definitively clarified and the comprehensive lncRNA expression signature in peripheral nerve regeneration remains fully unknown.We performed a high throughput microarray assay to detect lncRNA expression profile in the distal end of peripheral nerve at 0,3,7,14 day after injury.

DESIGN
72 C57Bl6 mice at the age around 2 months were selected and divided into 4 groups randomly depending on the time points of 0, 3, 7, 14 d after peripheral nerve injury. Each group included 18 mice of which 6 were pooled into a sample (three biological replication in one group)

PLATFORM
GPL21035 Agilent-074622 Mouse LncRNA v6 4X180K [Probe Name Version]
