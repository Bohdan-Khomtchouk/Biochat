TITLE
Molecular profiling of anemia in acute renal allograft rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compromised renal function after renal allograft transplantation often results in anemia in the recipient. Molecular mechanisms leading to anemia during acute rejection are not fully understood; inadequate erythropoietin production and iron deficiency have been reported to be the main contributors. To increase our understanding of the molecular events underlying anemia in acute rejection, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from four pediatric renal allograft recipients with acute rejection and concurrent anemia, using DNA microarrays containing 9000 human cDNA clones (representing 7469 unique genes). In these anemic rejecting patients, an 'erythropoiesis cluster' of 11 down-regulated genes was identified, involved in hemoglobin transcription and synthesis, iron and folate binding and transport. Additionally, some alloimmune response genes were simultaneously down-regulated. An independent data set of 36 PBL samples, some with acute rejection and some with concurrence of acute rejection and anemia, were analyzed to support a possible association between acute rejection and anemia. In conclusion, analysis using DNA microarrays has identified a cluster of genes related to hemoglobin synthesis and/or erythropoeisis that was altered in kidneys with renal allograft rejection compared with normal kidneys. The possible relationship between alterations in the expression of this cluster, reduced renal function, the alloimmune process itself, and other influences on the renal transplant awaits further analysis. A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Keywords: disease_state_design
