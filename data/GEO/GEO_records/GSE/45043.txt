TITLE
Age-mediated transcriptomic changes in adult mouse substantia nigra

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is highly sensitive to normal aging and selectively degenerates in Parkinson's disease. Until now, molecular mechanisms behind SNpc aging have not been fully investigated using high throughput techniques. Here, aging-associated early changes in transcriptome of SNpc were investigated comparing late middle-aged (18 months old) to young (2 months old) mice.

DESIGN
Three age groups of C57 wild type mice were used in microarray analysis: young (2 months old), middle aged (10 months old), and late-middle aged (18 months old) mice. Four replicates were included in each age group and each replicate was pooled from 4 mice (4 mice/replicate x 4 replicates x 3 age groups). Total RNA was isolated from SNpc for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
