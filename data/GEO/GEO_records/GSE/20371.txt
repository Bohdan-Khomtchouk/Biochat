TITLE
PPARd target genes in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The PPAR (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) family of nuclear receptors has three members: PPARg, PPARa and PPARd. Although they share similar structures, their biological functions are distinct. PPARg controls lipid storage and adipogenesis, while PPARd is associated with fat burning. The highly specific synthetic ligand for PPARd, GW501516, is a promising drug candidate for obesity and diabetes. Here we use Affymetrix microarray to analyze gene expression profile in mouse embryo fibroblasts treated with 100 nM GW501516 for 0, 2, 8 and 24 hours. These data may provide new clues into the molecular mechanism by which GW501516 ameliorates obesity and diabetes.

DESIGN
Wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stably infected with retroviruses MSCVpuro expressing PPARd were plated at 0.5 million per 10 cm dish. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 100nM GW501516 for 0h, 2h, 8h and 48h. Cells were collected at subconfluent condition. Total RNAs were sequentially purified with Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and analyzed in triplicate on Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) at NIDDK Microarray Core Facility following standard protocols.
