TITLE
Mouse lung transcriptome response to infection with H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cellular transcriptome of C57BL/6 mouse lungs was profiled by mRNA-Seq analysis at multiple time points in response to infection with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus. The Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo mutant virus is an attenuated H5N1 virus generated from wild-type Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus as described in Steel, J., et al. J Virol. 2009 Feb; 83(4):1742-53. A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2) influenza virus replicates poorly in mice and lung tissue collected from mice inoculated with this virus did not carry viral loads detectable by plaque assay.

DESIGN
Six to eight week-old female C57BL/6 mice were infected with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), or A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus. Lungs from 3 infected mice per experimental group were collected at 12h, 1d, 2d, 3d and 4d post infection. Lungs of mice treated with PBS, collected after 4 d, served as mock control.
