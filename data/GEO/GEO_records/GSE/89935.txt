TITLE
Identification of potential ABBV-075 responsive markers in mouse whole blood

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes that are modulated by BET inhibitors in blood, we determined global gene expression changes in ABBV-075-treated mouse whole blood samples

DESIGN
Mice were dosed with vehicle, 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg ABBV-075 for 6 hours, and whole blood was collected and subjected to total RNA extration and miroarray analysis. Each dosing group contains 5 mice.
