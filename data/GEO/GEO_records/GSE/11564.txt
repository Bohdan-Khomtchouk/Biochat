TITLE
Discovery of the targets of the immune response to chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2 patients using protein microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The binding of serum immunoglobulins to proteins was compared using serum from after and before an immunotherapeutic intervention (donor lymphocyte infusion) in two patients who had relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) after bone marrow transplant. One Invitrogen ProtoArray was used for each sample. Significant interactions were determined by comparing the before and after samples for each patient separately, using the Concentration-Dependent Analysis described in Marina et al., J Proteome Res, 2008. One sample from before and one sample from after immunotherapy were tested for each patient. Keywords: Immune response discovery

DESIGN
One sample from before and one sample from after immunotherapy were tested for each patient.
