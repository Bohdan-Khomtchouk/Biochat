TITLE
RIP-Chip of endogenous Staufen and GFP-tagged Staufen from 0-3 hour Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Staufen-associated mRNAs were identified in early Drosophila embryos by RNA-co-immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis (RIP-Chip), using two complementary approaches: RIP-Chip from wild-type embryos using a synthetic anti-Staufen antibody, and RIP-Chip from transgenic GFP-Staufen-expressing embryos using an anti-GFP antibody. Genome-wide transcript expression in whole embryos was also assessed for the wild-type and GFP-Staufen lines.

DESIGN
There are 18 samples in total.  These include 3 replicates each of 1) gene expression profiling from total mRNA isolated from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos, 2) synthetic anti-Staufen antibody RNA co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous Staufen from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos, 3) control synthetic antibody RNA co-immunoprecipitations from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos, 4) gene expression profiling from total mRNA isolated from transgenic GFP-Staufen expressing 0-3 hour embryos, 5) anti-GFP RNA co-immunoprecipitations of GFP-Staufen from transgenic GFP-Staufen expressing 0-3 hour embryos, 6) anti-FLAG control RNA co-immunoprecipitations from transgenic GFP-Staufen expressing 0-3 hour embryos.
