TITLE
Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks and genomic contacts of human rDNA units are involved in epigenetic regulation [DSBs]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic chromosomes are subjected to spontaneous fragmentation even under quick isolation of DNA in a solid phase by strong treatment with 0.1 M EDTA, 1% SDS and proteinase K (1 mg/ml). The long DNA fragments of excised chromosomal DNA were denoted as forum domains. Mostly forum domains are of 50-200 kb in length, although larger domains, up to 500 - 700 kb, are also observed. The domains are delimited by hot spots of double-strand breaks (DSBs). We performed a genome-wide mapping of DSBs in human HEK293T cells cultured cells using Illumina deep sequencing of the termini of forum domains. We found that in rDNA units the hot spots of DSBs are distributed non-randomly. Mostly they are located in IGS.
