TITLE
MicroRNA miR-92a-2 targets TFPI2 to ameliorate oxidative stress of the hypoxia neuron [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the differential expression mRNA profiles from the brain cortex of hypoxia and normaixa rats by silica microarray chip.

DESIGN
The array consists of 3 samples. Samples E（H001-0605002307） consist of total RNA from the brain cortex of hypoxia rats in simulation 7km altitude; Samples A（H002-0605002308）: total RNA from the brain cortex of hypoxia rats in simulation 3km altitude; samples Z（H001-0605002307) :total RNA from the brain cortex of normaixa rats in simulation sea level altitude
