TITLE
Genomewide expression profile of wire-injured carotid arteries harvested from either miR-126+/+/ApoE-/- or miR-126-/-/ApoE-/- mice during neointima development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tried to identify mRNA targets of miR-126 involved in neointima formation in mice with an atherogenic background. Genome-wide expression profiling was carried out in wire-injured carotid arteries of miR-126+/+/ApoE-/- (control group) and miR-126-/-/ApoE-/- (target group) mice on western-type diet. RNA was isolated after 14 days following vascular injury (n=4 each group). Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE Microarrays (8x60K format) were used in combination with a one-color based hybridization protocol. Signals on the microarrays were detected using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. Differential gene expression was identified by applying appropriate biostatistics to the data set. GeneSpring GX11 analysis software was used to normalize and analyze the raw data

DESIGN
Genomewide expression profile of miR-126+/+/ApoE-/- and miR-126-/-/ApoE-/- mice were measured at 14 days after vascular injury . 4 animals per group were used.
