TITLE
Substrate-based regulation in gut fungi

ORGANISM
Neocallimastix californiae

SUMMARY
Differential expression analysis of overall transcriptome in response to varying carbon source

DESIGN
RNAseq of Neocallimastix californiae (G1) and Anaeromyces robustus (S4) grown on glucose, maltose, cellobiose, cellulose, reed canary grass, switchgrass, and corn stover as carbon sources. RNA was isolated during exponential growth and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq.
