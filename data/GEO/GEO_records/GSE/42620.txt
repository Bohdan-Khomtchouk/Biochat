TITLE
Human ALL Cell line RS4;11: Control vs. VE-465 treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines RS4;11: compare untreated RS4;11 with RS4;11 treated with VE-465. The goal was to determine the effects of VE-465 on global gene expression in RS4;11.

DESIGN
VE-465 induced gene expression in RS4;11 was measured at 48 hours after exposure to doses of 0 and 200 nM VE-465. Three independent experiments were performed.
