TITLE
Comparison of protein profiles in the serum of NPC patients with different prognosis by high-throughput protein microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High levels of c-Src in serum of patients with NPC was independent prognostic indicators for poor outcome of patients.

DESIGN
In this study, eight NPC patients with or without distant metastasis, followed up more than five years, was used to acquire protein profiles in serum to find out serum biomarkers to predict outcome in NPC patients.
