TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of C. jejuni HPC5 with C. jejuni HPC5 R14, R20, R14A, R14B, R20A, R20B and R20C.

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
C. jejuni HPC5 is a Campylobacter strain isolated from chickens. Following bacteriophage CP34 treatment on chickens colonised by C. jejuni HPC5, a series of CP34 insensitive strains like C. jejuni HPC5 R14 and C. jejuni HPC5 R20 were obtained which compromised their ability to colonise chickens. Reintroduction of C. jejuni HPC5 R14 and R20 in to chickens led to reversion of these strains and the MRPs of the revertant strains fell in to different classes termed C. jejuni HPC5 R14A, R14B, R20A, R20B and R20C and these strained were tested positive for colonisation  proficient and bacteriophage sensitive.

DESIGN
There are three biological replicates for each experiment. Seven independent cDNA preps of C. jejuni HPC5 were prepared and they were labelled independently using AF555. The labelled cDNAs were mixed together and this acted as the control. Each daughter strains were considered as sample and they were labelled with AF645. Hybridisations were done between C. jejuni HPC5 and C. jejuni HPC5 as one of the sample and each of the daughter strains in triplicates. The supplementary files (linked at the foot of this record) contain the summary of the replicate data of the corresponding strain (3 replicates/strain) which have been averaged.
