TITLE
Response to TGFB in colon fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained gene expression signatures from TGF-beta treated fribroblasts. Upregulated genes predict poor prognosis in Colorectal Cancer.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts extracted from human normal colon mucosa were treated with TGF-Î²1 for 8 hours. Gene expression profiles for treated or untreated fibroblasts were measured in duplicate using HG-133+PM Affimetrix arrays.
