TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of PPARg regulated gene expression in adipose progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of PPARg targets in adipose progenitor cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that PPARg control adipose nichenenesis and niche occupancy through regulating downstream targets in adipose progenitors. Results provide important information of the response of PPARg deletion in adipose progenitor cells, such as specific up- or down-regulated genes involved in cellular adhesion, chemotaxis and mural cell to endothelial interactions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from flow sorted GFP+ cells and GFP- cells of pparg null adipose tissue compared to pparg het adipose tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
