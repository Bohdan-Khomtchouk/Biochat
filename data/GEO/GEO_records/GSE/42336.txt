TITLE
Gene expression in human prostate cancer cell lines regulated by HIC1 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to further our understanding of the role that hypermethylatioted in cancer 1 (HIC1) plays in prostate cancer (PCa) development. Microarrays were searched for some genes that had correlated expression with HIC1 mRNA. Our data showed that HIC1 promoter hypermethylation was presented in cell lines, tissues and plasma of PCa patients. According to fold-change screening between restoring expression of HIC1 and its respective control cells, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were commonly observed in PC3 and C4-2B cells.

DESIGN
The restoring expression HIC1 in PCa lines were respectively noted as PC3-HIC1 and C4-2B-HIC1 cells, and the respective controls were noted as C4-2B-GFP and PC3-GFP cells.
