TITLE
Krüppel-like Transcription Factor-10 (KLF10) Provides a Negative Feedback Mechanism to Suppress TGFβ-Induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined transcriptome-wide effects of pertrurbation in KLF10 function (siKLF10) on TGFβ-regulated genes and EMT in two different cells lines: A549 and Panc1.

DESIGN
We performed  mRNA sequencing from A549 and Panc1 cells following following  TGFβ treatment and KLF10 knockdown. The mRNA-Seq includes following conditions: siControl, siKLF10, TGFβ, siKLF10+TGFβ (A549 and Panc1 cells). mRNA-sequencing was performed in duplicates for A549 and triplicates for Panc1 cells.
