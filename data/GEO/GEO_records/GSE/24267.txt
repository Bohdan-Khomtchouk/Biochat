TITLE
Response of Candida glabrata to low pH

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
To examine the role of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked aspartyl protease, CgYps1, in the regulation of pH homeostasis in Candida glabrata, transcriptional profiling analysis was carried out on wild-type and Cgyps1∆ cells grown in YNB medium (pH 5.5) and in YNB medium adjusted to pH 2.0. Genes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, protein folding and stress response pathways were found to be differentially regulated in response to acidic environment in both the strains.
