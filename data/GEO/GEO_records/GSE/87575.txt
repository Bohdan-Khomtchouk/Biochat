TITLE
lncRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and normal B cells with and without stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of lncRNA expression in negatively selected pooled peripheral blood CLL samples compared to pooled peripheral blood normal B-cells with or without stimulation with CD40 ligand.

DESIGN
Primary B-cells were isolated and treated in vitro with CD40L. RNAwas iolated from cells for gene expression analysis. Two pools of RNA from CLL patient samples (P1 and P2, n=5 per pool) with mixed clinical and molecular histories, unstimulated or stimulated with CD40 ligand (PeproTech), were compared to a pool of healthy donor B cells (NB, n=6) unstimulated or stimulated with CD40 ligand.
