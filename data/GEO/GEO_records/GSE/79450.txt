TITLE
Expression data from infant ALL with MLL-AF4 rearrangement

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MLL-AF4+ blasts from infant B-ALL, CB-derived CD34+CD38-CD19-CD33- HSC, CB-derived CD34+CD19+CD33- B-cell HPCs and CB-derived CD34+CD33+CD19- myeloid HPCs. We used microarray to estudy gene expression profile comparing ALL vs HSC, HPC and myeloid HPSC.

DESIGN
We used highly FACS-purified (purity > 98%) MLL-AF4+ blasts from infant B-ALL, CB-derived CD34+CD38-CD19-CD33- HSC, CB-derived CD34+CD19+CD33- B-cell HPCs and CB-derived CD34+CD33+CD19- myeloid HPCs. For each independent sample technical duplicates were always performed. Total RNA was extracted using TRIol reagent, and quantified on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Bioanalyzer. High-quality RNA was reverse transcribed and the obtained cDNA was used as a template to synthesize biotinylanted cDNA, then was fragmented and hybridized as duplicates/triplicates to HG-U133 plus2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer's guideline.
