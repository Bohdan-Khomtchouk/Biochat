TITLE
Telomeric ORFs (TLOs) in pathogenic Candida spp. encode Mediator subunits that regulate the transcription of distinct subsets of genes

ORGANISM
Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
Analysis of the role of the Candida dubliniensis Telomeric (TLO) genes and MED3, encoding subunits of Mediator, in regulating transcription The transcriptional response of a Candida dubliniensis TLO1/TLO2 double (null) mutant was analysed. Reintegrant strains harboring TLO1 or TLO2 were compared to this null mutant to elucidate the individual role of each ORF. The role of MED3 was compared also.

DESIGN
9 experiemental parameters were analysed, each carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate

PLATFORM
GPL18896 Candida dubliniensis V.2
