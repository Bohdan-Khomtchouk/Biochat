TITLE
Expression  data from K5-IKKbeta transgenic mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IKKbeta is a subunit of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex required for NF-kB activation in response to pro-inflammatory signals. NF-kB regulates the expression of many genes involved in inflammation, immunity and apoptosis, and also controls cell proliferation and differentiation in different tissues; however, its function in skin physiopathology remains controversial. We here report the alterations caused by increased IKKbeta activity in basal cells of the skin of transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Transgenic mice which express the IKKbeta gene under the control of the keratin K5 regulatory elements were generated. We analyzed back skins from wildtype and transgenic animals. Each individual array has RNA from three different mice of the same genotype.
