TITLE
Expression  data from K5-IKKbeta transgenic mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IKKbeta is a subunit of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex required for NF-kB activation in response to pro-inflammatory signals. NF-kB regulates the expression of many genes involved in inflammation, immunity and apoptosis, and also controls cell proliferation and differentiation in different tissues; however, its function in skin physiopathology remains controversial. We here report the alterations caused by increased IKKbeta activity in basal cells of the skin of transgenic mice.
