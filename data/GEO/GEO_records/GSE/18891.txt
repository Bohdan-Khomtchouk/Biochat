TITLE
Foxl2 mediated expression data from KK1 granulosa cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Foxl2 transcription factor is required for ovarian function during follicular development.  Our approach to begin to understand Foxl2 function is through the identification of Foxl2 regulated genes in the ovary. Transiently transfected KK1 mouse granulosa cells were used to identify genes that are potentially regulated by Foxl2.  KK1 cells were transfected in three groups (mock, activated, and repressed) and twenty-four hours later RNA was isolated and submitted for Affymetrix microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To increase the potential of Foxl2 to alter gene expression levels of putative target genes, two fusions were constructed consisting of Foxl2 fused to the activation domain of the Herpes simplex virus VP16 transcription factor (Foxl2-VP16) and Foxl2 fused to the repression domain of the murine MAD transcription factor (Foxl2-MAD).  Levels of gene expression were compared between mock transfected cells and those that were transfected with Foxl2-VP16 and Foxl2-MAD, respectively.
