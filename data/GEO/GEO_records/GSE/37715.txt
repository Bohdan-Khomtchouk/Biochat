TITLE
Expression data in human hepatocytes with HCV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human hepatocyte chimeric mice were prepared and treated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or interferon-alpha (IFN-α). To analyze the changes in gene expression, cDNA microarray analysis was performed with the collected human hepatocytes from the chimeric mouse livers. We consider that these results provide molecular insights into possible mechanisms used by HCV to evade innate immune responses, as well as novel therapeutic targets and a potential new indication for interferon therapy.

DESIGN
A total of 15 human hepatocyte chimeric mice were prepared and divided into four experimental groups. Mice in group A were neither infected with HCV nor treated with IFN. Mice in group B were administered IFN-α 6 h before sacrifice but were not infected with HCV. The mice in groups C and D were both inoculated via the mouse tail vein with human serum containing HCV genotype 1b particles. At 8 weeks after inoculation, the mice in group D were administered IFN-α 6 h before sacrifice, but the mice in group C were not treated with IFN-α. The human hepatocytes in the mouse livers were collected after sacrifice and subjected to microarray analysis. After purification and reverse transcription of total RNA, cDNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
