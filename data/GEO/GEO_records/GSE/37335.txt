TITLE
Chip-chip from human ES cells (H1), iPS cells (iPSC38), astrocytes (HA) and aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) with H3K9me2 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone modification H3K9me2 is associated with gene silencing and forming large heterochromatin domains. But the micro-structure within large H3K9me2 domains and their relationship with DNA methylation remains unclear. This dataset was generated to compare with genome-wide DNA methylation data.

DESIGN
Genome-wide distribution of H3K9me2 in human fibroblasts was mapped using ChIP-chip.
