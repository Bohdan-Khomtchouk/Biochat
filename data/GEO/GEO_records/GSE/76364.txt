TITLE
mRNA expression during fracture healing in diabetic rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The association between DM and impaired fracture healing including delayed union and nonunion has been documented in clinical and experimental settings. We examine mRNA expression specific for impaired fracture healing in diabetic rat.

DESIGN
12w, male, Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were divided into two groups. As a model for impaired fracture-repairing ability, diabetic rats were created by a single intravenous injection of 40 mg/kg streptozotocin. Control rats were injected with sodium chloride as a sham treatment. Closed transverse femoral shaft fractures were created in both groups. Briefly, a 1.25-mm diameter K-wire was inserted retrograde into the right femoral intramedullary canal and a closed transverse femoral shaft fracture was produced using a three-point bending apparatus with a drop weight. Five animals from each group were euthanized at post-fracture days 5 and 11 respectively for microarray analysis. At the each time points, the newly generated specific tissues, that is, the fracture callus, were harvested.
