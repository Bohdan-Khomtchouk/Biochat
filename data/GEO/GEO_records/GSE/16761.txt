TITLE
Expression data from activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
genes regualted by LPS or LPS+cAMP stimulation in BMDCs We used microarrays to identify genes that up-regulated by LPS+cAMP compared with just LPS.

DESIGN
BMDCs were stimilated with LPS (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of cAMP (100 microM) for 3h. Specifically up-regualted gene by cMP was identified.
