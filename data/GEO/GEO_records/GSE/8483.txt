TITLE
Gene expression in Histone H1 null mutant cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In chicken DT40 cells, there are six linker histone H1 variants and 12 of coding genes. We have previously reported of 11 out of 12 H1 knock out DT40 cells (Takami et al., Genes to Cell 1997 [PMID:9491804]) but complete H1 null DT40 cells could not established, so far. We identified one of the H1 variant, H1R was involved in genomic instabilities (Hashimoto et al., DNA repair (2007) [17613284]), so we re-introduced floxed H1R-eGFP and mer-cre-mer into 11 out of 12 H1 knock out DT40 cells. Then we targeted last enedogenous H1, we successfully established conditional H1 KO cells (K11). Next we treated with tamoxifen to loop out floxed H1R-eGFP, and cloning H1 completely null cells (K11-5, and K11-7). We analysis those gene expression pattern in wild-type, K11, and K11-5 cells (Hashimoto et al., NAR (2010), PMID:20156997) Keywords: gene expression array-based, count
