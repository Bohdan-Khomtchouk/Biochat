TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of lung tissue of rat pretreated with cobalt in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and comapring with saline treated normoxic and hypoxic lung tissue in different time interval

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to examine the effect of hypoxic preconditioning with cobalt on global gene profiling in lung tissues.
