TITLE
Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila simulans small RNAs

ORGANISM
Drosophila pseudoobscura ; Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila simulans small RNAs. ~18-26nt RNAs were isolated from total RNA using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were cloned from Drosophila pseudoobscura (heads and pooled 0-12 and 12-24 hour embryos) and Drosophila simulans (pooled 0-12 and 12-24 hour embryos). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina 1G platform.  Following removal of 3' linker sequences, the clipped sequences longer than 18 nt were kept.
