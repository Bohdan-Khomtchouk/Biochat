TITLE
Budding yeast Wapl controls sister chromatid cohesion maintenance and the chromosome condensation status [BrdU-ChIP].

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cohesin acetylation by Eco1 during DNA replication establishes sister chromatid cohesion. We show that acetylation makes cohesin resistant to Wapl activity from S-phase until mitosis. Wapl turns out to be a key regulator of cohesin dynamics on chromosomes by controling cohesin maintenance following its establishment in S-phase and its role in chromosome condensation.

DESIGN
The Affymetrix Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chip Tiling 1.0F Arrays were used to analyze the incorporation of BrdU in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in S-phase arrested cells.
