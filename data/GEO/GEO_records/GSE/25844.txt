TITLE
Early target genes of aflatoxin B1 in human hepatic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles induced by the mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), in primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells. Initial mechanisms involved in the complex multistep process leading to malignant transformation by chemicals remain largely unknown. We have analysed changes in gene expression profiles in primary human hepatocytes and differentiated human hepatoma HepaRG cells after a 24 h treatment with 0.05 or 0.25µM aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent genotoxic hepatocarcinogen.

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates of HepaRG cell cultures and two pools of three primary human hepatocyte cultures each, were investigated. Cells were treated with 0.05 or 0.25µM AFB1 for 24 h.
