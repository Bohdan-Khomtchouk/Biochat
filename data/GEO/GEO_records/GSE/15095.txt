TITLE
Exon arrays for human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were used to study if genomic copy number variation changes detected with SNP 6.0 array would correlate with the expression level changes in human embryonic stem cells These samples were used as a portion of the study evaluating the genomic stability and its effects on human embryonic stem cells in prolonged culture.

DESIGN
Selected nine human embryonic stem cell samples from different lines having different kind of genomic abnormalities were hybridized to exon arrays.
