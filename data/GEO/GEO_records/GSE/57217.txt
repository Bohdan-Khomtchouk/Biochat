TITLE
Cross talk between the cell wall integrity and cAMP/protein kinase A pathways in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen of immunocompromised people that causes fatal meningitis.   The fungal cell wall is essential to viability and pathogenesis of C. neoformans, and biosynthesis and repair of the wall is primarily controlled by the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway.  Previous work by us and others have shown that deletion of genes encoding the four major kinases in the CWI signaling pathway, namely PKC1, BCK1, MKK2 and MPK1 results in severe cell wall phenotypes, sensitivity to a variety of cell wall stressors and, for Mpk1, reduced virulence in a mouse model.  Here, we examined the global transcriptional response of gene deletions of BCK1, MKK2 and MPK1 compared to wild-type cells.  We found over 1000 genes were differentially expressed in one or more of the deletion strains, with 115 genes differentially expressed in all three strains, many of which have been identified as genes regulated by the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.  Biochemical measurements of cAMP levels in the kinase deletion stains revealed significantly less cAMP in all of the deletion strains compared to wild-type cells.  The deletion strains also produced significantly smaller capsules than wild type KN99 under capsule inducing conditions, although they shed similar levels of capsule as wild type.  Finally, addition of exogenous cAMP led to reduced sensitivity to cell wall stress and restored surface capsule to near wild-type levels.  Thus, we have direct evidence of cross talk between the CWI and cAMP/PKA pathways that may have important implications for regulation of cell wall and capsule homeostasis.

DESIGN
Comparison of three gene deletion strains to wild-type, with 3 biological replicates for each sample.
