TITLE
Combinatorial Signal Preception in the BMP Pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data consist of an expression survey of three receptor cell lines and the parental cell types was performed to determine expression of BMP related genes.

DESIGN
Sequence libraries for three cell types were constructed using NEBNext Ultra RNA-seq (NEB #E7530) and sequenced on Illumnia HiSeq2500.
