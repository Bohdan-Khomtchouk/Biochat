TITLE
Integrated analyses of zebrafish miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identify miR-29b and miR-223 as potential regulators of optic nerve regeneration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyse expression profiles of zebrafish retina after optic nerve crush to identify potential regulatory mechanisms that underpin central nerve regeneration

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 4 samples (pooling 4 animals) of Zebrafish retinae after performing optic nerve crush (at day 3 post crush) vs 4 samples (pooling 4 animals) of control (unoperated) Zebrafish retinae

PLATFORM
GPL14688 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Feature Number version)
