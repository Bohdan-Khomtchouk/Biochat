TITLE
Nfatc1 Orchestrates Aging in Hair Follicle Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse hair follicles undergo synchronized cycles. Cyclical regeneration and hair growth is fueled by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). We used ChIP-seq to unfold genome-wide chromatin landscapes of Nfatc1 and dissect the biological relevence of its upstream BMP signaling in HFSC aging.

DESIGN
Telogen quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) were FACS-purified for ChIP-sequcencing.
