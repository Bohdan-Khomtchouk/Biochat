TITLE
Effect of Healthy Nordic diet on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a randomized controlled dietary intervention study we compared an isocaloric Healthy Nordic diet with the average Nordic diet for influence on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression. We studied obese adults with features of the metabolic syndrom, n=66. There was no significant difference in age, BMI, or gene expression between the groups before the intervention. The intervention lasted for 18-24 weeks.

DESIGN
Blood samples were obtained before (W0), during (W12) and after completion (W18-24) of the dietary intervention. From the samples we extracted RNA. From total RNA we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and then washed, stained and scanned the slides using standardised protocols (Affymetrix Inc.).
