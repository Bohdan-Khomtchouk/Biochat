TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Normoxia and Hypoxia Macrophage Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test in an unbiased manner for hypoxia effect, we performed a transcriptomic analysis using high throughput RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Homo Sapiens Macrophage gene expression
