TITLE
Analysis of Colletotrichum orbiculare infection of N. benthamiana

ORGANISM
Colletotrichum orbiculare

SUMMARY
Species from the genus Colletotrichum are the causal agents of anthracnose which contribute to significant losses to the production of commercially grown crops.  The genomes of Colletotrichum orbiculare, which infects cucurbits and Nicotiana benthamiana, as well as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which infects a wide range of fruits and vegetables, were sequenced.  A custom microarray was designed for Colletotrichum orbiculare and used to assess gene expression during infection of Nicotiana benthamiana. Gene expression of Colletotrichum orbiculare growing on its host Nicotiana benthamiana was assessed at 24 hours post inoculation, 3 days post inoculation and 7 days post inoculation.  Mycelia growing in vitro and ungerminated conidia were used as controls.  Three replicates were performed for each time point.
