TITLE
S100A8/A9 activate key genes and pathways in colon tumor progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Studies using bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that S100A8/A9 expression on myeloid cells is essential for development of colon tumors. Our results thus reveal a novel role for myeloid-derived S100A8/A9 in activating specific downstream genes associated with tumorigenesis and in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.

DESIGN
Subconfluent cultures of MC38 cells were serum-starved for 16 hrs and activated with 10ug/mL S100A8/A9 for 6 hrs. Total RNA was extracted from unactivated or activated cells. 2 replicates each per stimulated cells, unstimulated cells, and control cells.
