TITLE
Myc-dependent gene activation and repression in oncogene-addicted liver tumors (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumors driven by activation of the transcription factor Myc generally show oncogene addiction. However, the gene-expression programs that depend upon sustained Myc activity in those tumors remain unknown. We have addressed this issue in a model of liver carcinoma driven by a reversible tet-Myc transgene, combining gene expression profiling with the mapping of Myc and RNA Polymerase II on chromatin. Switching off the oncogene in advanced carcinomas revealed that Myc is required for the continuous activation and repression of distinct sets of genes, constituting no more than half of those deregulated during tumor progression, and an even smaller subset of all Myc-bound genes. We further showed that a Myc mutant unable to associate with the co-repressor protein Miz1 is defective in the initiation of liver tumorigenesis. Altogether, our data provide the first detailed analysis of a Myc-dependent transcriptional program in a fully developed carcinoma, revealing that the critical effectors of Myc in tumor maintenance must be included within defined subsets (ca. 1,300 each) of activated and repressed genes.
