TITLE
Identifying CHIR99021 and AICAR-regulated genes in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that CHIR99021 promotes self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells, however, the target genes of CHIR99021 is not fully understood. AICAR is the activator of AMP-activated protein kinase. It is reported that AICAR plays important role in mouse embryonic stem cells, however the moleculor mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. To better understand the downstream target genes of CHIR99021 and AICAR, we performed Microarray analyses to identify their downstream targets. The data show the genes regulated by CHIR99021 or AICAR.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in  medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented without or with CHIR99021 or AICAR for 24 hours, then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
