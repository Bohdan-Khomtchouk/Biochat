TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana roots at 7DAG; Col-0, scl3 (LOF) and SCL3 OE (GOF)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of root part comparing wild type with scl3 mutant and SCL3 OE.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to determine the effect of GRAS transcription factor SCL3 on growth and development of Arabidopsis root system by global transcriptome analysis and to identify new regulators in the regulatory pathway.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiments, Col-0, scl3 and SCL3 OE. Biological triplicates: 3 WT, 3 scl3 and 3 SCL3 OE

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
