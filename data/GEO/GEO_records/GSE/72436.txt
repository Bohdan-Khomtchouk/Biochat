TITLE
Gene expression profiles upon knocking down Cops2 or Cops5 in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the role of Cops2 in mouse embryonic stem cells, we applied expression microarray analysis with GFP knockdown, Cops2 knockdown (2 different hairpins), and Cops5 knockdown mouse ESCs.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs were transfected with shGFP, shCops2(two different shRNAs), or shCops5 plasmids. 72 hours after transfection, cells were harvested for RNA prep and microarray analysis.
