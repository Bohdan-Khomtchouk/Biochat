TITLE
Human AsPC1-CFP and AsPC1-AKT PDAC orthotopic tumors: Lean vs Obese

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing human AsPC1 PDA cells transduced with either CFP control or myristoylated-AKT orthotopically grown in pancreata of lean vs obese Rag1-/- immunodeficient mice for 5 weeks (100,000 cells/pancreas). The Goal was to determine the transcriptional deregulation of Obesity-driven and AKT-driven tumors.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: AsPC1-CFP lean, AsPC1-CFP obese, AsPC1-AKT lean and AsPC1-AKT obese tumors all normalized to one control: AsPC1-CFP cells.  9 biological replicates per group.  Equal amounts of differentially labeled control AsPC1-CFP cells propagated in culture and sample tumor cRNA were combined such that each sample contained at least 2.5 pmol dye on dual-labeling arrays.
