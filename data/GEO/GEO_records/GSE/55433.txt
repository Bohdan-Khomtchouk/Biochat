TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As various data suggest that lncRNAs are important in human cancer, we hypothesized that they play a role in urothelial carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis we analysed 83 normal and malignant urothelial samples using NCodeâ„¢ Human Non-coding RNA Microarrays for differentially expressed lncRNAs with potential regulatory functions in urothelial cell cancer (UCC). We identified global changes in lncRNA expression that reflect the disease phenotype. We then performed explorative analysis (siRNA gene knock-down and loss-of-function studies) of selected species and identified those with potential prognostic roles. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate the microarray findings.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from urothelial samples from 57 patients with UCC (23 low-grade NMI, 14 high-grade NMI and 20 invasive tumours) and from 26 disease free controls.
