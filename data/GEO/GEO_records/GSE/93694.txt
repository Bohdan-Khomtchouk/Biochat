TITLE
Expression of p27 target  genes in WT HCT116 cells vs shPCAF knock down cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional programs regulated by PCAF and p27 in the colon cancer cell line HCT116 by ChIP-seq. PCAF or p27 knock down revealed that both regulated the expression of common genes. In this dataset, we include the expression data of 852 genes regulated by PCAF, obtained from the comparison between  WT HCT116 cells and shPCAF knock down cells

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed in total. 2 control samples: asynchronously growing HCT116 cells transfected with shRNA control. 2 reference samples: asynchronously growing HCT116 cells transfected with shRNAPCAF.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
