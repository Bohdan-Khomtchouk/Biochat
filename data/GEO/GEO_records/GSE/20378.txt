TITLE
PTC1 mutant Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to deoxynivalenol

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The evaluation of the toxicity of deoxynivalenol using yeast gene expressions. Yeast PTC1 mutant strain was used for this study. SDS was used to raise the penetration of the yeast cell membrane. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Two conditions were compared by the gene expression profiles. Both samples were grown in 0.01% SDS contained YPD media, and one of them was also supplied with 50 ppm of deoxynivalenol.

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
