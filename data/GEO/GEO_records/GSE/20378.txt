TITLE
PTC1 mutant Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to deoxynivalenol

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The evaluation of the toxicity of deoxynivalenol using yeast gene expressions. Yeast PTC1 mutant strain was used for this study. SDS was used to raise the penetration of the yeast cell membrane. Keywords: stress response
