TITLE
The Arabidopsis thaliana map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutant transcriptomes upon the compatible interaction with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations in map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutants, 3 days after water treatment and inoculation with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa)

DESIGN
In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the wild-type Wassilewskija (WS) ecotype, and from the map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutants were treated with water, or inoculated with the Hpa isolate Emwa1 to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at 3 days after onset of treatment. Data from the water-treated and Hpa-infected wild-type were previously deposited as GSM914964, GSM914965, GSM914966, and GSM914967. The wild-type data, and the data from the map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutant presented here were established in the same set of experiments and analyses, which also involved the previously deposited pskr1-5 mutant (GSM914968, GSM914969, GSM914970, and GSM914971).
