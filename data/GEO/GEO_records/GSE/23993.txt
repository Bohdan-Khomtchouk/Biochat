TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by nucleolin in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further explore the function and underlying mechanism of nucleolin in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we compared the transcription profile of tetracycline (Tc)-inducible EGFP (as a control) or nucleolin siRNA expression-stable ESCs cultured with or without Tc for 3 days, and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes by nucleolin in mouse ESCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CGR8 ES cells stably integrated with Tc-inducible siRNA EGFP, nucleoin-1 or nucleolin-2 cultured with or without Tc for 3 days, and then hybridized to Illumina Sentrix Mouse-6 v2.0 BeadChips. Three replicates each condition.

PLATFORM
