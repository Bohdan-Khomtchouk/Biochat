TITLE
Effect of cardiomyocyte KLF5 deletion in cardiac gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kruppel-like factor 5 gene was deleted (Cre-lox) system specifically in cardiomyocytes (aMHC-promoter-driven expression of Cre) and RNA was purified from total hearts (TRIZOL method) following perfusion of the heart with PBS. Basal levels cardiac RNA was analyzed with whole genome microarray chips.

DESIGN
There were two groups of mice: 4 mice that had KLF5 gene floxed without expressing Cre recombinase (control group) and 4 mice that were expressing Cre in cardiomyocytes and therefore KLF5 gene was deleted and thus not expressed in this particular cell type.
