TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of TOR inhibited cotton seedlings using RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analysis the expression profiling of cotton seedlings under TOR inhibition by AZD. TOR inhibition significantly altered the expression levels of anabolic and catabolic processes related genes, photosynthesis and phytohormone signaling pathways related genes. Expression profiling analysis reveals that TOR is a key player in cotton seedlings growth.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of DMSO and AZD treated cotton seedlings were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform.
