TITLE
Inter-strain Heterogeneity in Responses to TCDD

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We profiled hepatic transcriptional responses of 6 strains of rats with varying sensitivity to a dioxin, TCDD, at 19 hours following exposure. The resistant rats exhibited significantly reduced transcriptional responses in comparison to the sensitive strains. We hypothesize that genes which show differential changes between the resistant and sensitive rats may potentially explain sensitivity.

DESIGN
Rats with varying sensitivities (Long-Evans, L-E; Han/Wistar, H/W; Fischer 344, F344; Wistar, Wis; Line-A, Ln-A; and Line-C, Ln-C) were treated with 100 ug/kg TCDD or corn oil vehicle and euthanized 19 hours post-treatment. Each treatment group contains four or six animals (biological replicates), each of which was assayed on an individual microarray.
