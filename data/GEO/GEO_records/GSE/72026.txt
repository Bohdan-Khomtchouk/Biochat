TITLE
Gene expression profiling for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IVLBCL is a rare distinct disease entity of extranodal large B-cell lymphoma. The disease is characterized by selective growth of tumor cells in the lumina of small vessels and by the absence of remarkable lymphoadenopathy. We have developed patient derived xenograft IVLBCL mouse models from primary bone marrow samples. This dataset includes the gene expression profiling of IVLBCL tumor cells from the mouse xenograft models.

DESIGN
To evaluate the gene expression profiling of IVLBCL, tumor cells in tumor formed spleen in 4 mouse models (IVLBCL#1, #2, #3, and #4) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 4 normal healthy volunteer donors (PB#1, #2, #3, and #4) were purified by CD19 positive magnetic beads selection. Total RNA was extracted from these CD19 positive cells.Total eight RNA samples were then analyzed to evaluate the gene expression profiling for IVLBCL.
