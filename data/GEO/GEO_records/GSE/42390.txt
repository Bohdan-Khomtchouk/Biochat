TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Scl/TAL1 in human erythroid cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq experiments using an Scl/TAL1 antibody were carried out in primary erythroid cells cultured from two individuals of Caucasian origin. ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared from two biological replicates for each individual. ChIP DNA was processed for Illumina High-throughput sequencing according to Illumina protocol. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from each experiments, we generated a high-resolution map of Scl/TAL1 genomic targets in human  erythroid cells. We find that WGATAR and the combinatorial CTG(n9)GATA are the most significant motifs responsible for the chromatin occupancy by Scl/TAL1. In addition, other motifs are also significantly enriched at the Scl/TAL1 targets. Amongst these were binding sites for known TFs (Sp/XKLF, RUNX1, NFE2). We next investigated how many of these targets varied between these two individuals. We find that 0.8% of Scl/TAL1 binding regions differ significantly between the two individuals.
