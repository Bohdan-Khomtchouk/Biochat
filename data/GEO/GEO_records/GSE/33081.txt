TITLE
Identification of GLD-1 target mRNAs

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine which mRNAs are bound by GLD-1 we performed GLD-1 and MYC (as a negative control) immunoprecipitation experiments on wildtype animals.

DESIGN
A total of 6 samples was analyzed (triplicates of GLD-1 IPs and MYC IPs respectively)
