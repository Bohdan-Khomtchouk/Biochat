TITLE
MDM from COPD patients and healthy subjects after treatment with LPS or fine and ultrafine particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study gene expression of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and healthy subjects was investigated. MDM were treated with LPS, a combination of fine TiO2 and ultrafine Printex90 particles, or remained untreated. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
MDM of 13 COPD patients and 13 healthy subjects were incubated for four hours with LPS (10ng/ml), a combination of fine TiO2 and ultrafine Printex90 (32ug/ml each) or remained untreated. Cells were harvested, counted, and total RNA was isolated (phenol-chloroform extraction) for each subject individually. Total RNA of the 13 individuals from each group (COPD, healthy) and incubation (untreated, LPS, particles) were pooled and hybridized on a seperate array.
