TITLE
CHD6 transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing a control siRNA or a siRNA especific for CHD6 protein. 48H post-transfection, total RNA was isolated and used for transcriptome analysis. Four biological replicates carried out by triplicate were used.

DESIGN
4 replicates each of HEK293T cells transfected with siRNA especific for CHD6 protein (siRNAm) and with a control siRNA (Contr) were analyzed

PLATFORM
