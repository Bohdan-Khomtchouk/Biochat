TITLE
cdr2 siRNA knockdown during passage through mitosis: HeLa cells, Rat1 wild type and c-myc null cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
[Hela cells]: We performed cdr2 knockdown with a pool of 4 cdr2-specific siRNAs to test whether cdr2 may regulate c-myc target genes as cells passage through mitosis. [Rat1a wild type and myc null cells]: We performed cdr2 knockdown using a pool of 4 cdr2-specific siRNAs  to test whether cdr2 may regulate c-myc target genes as cells passage through mitosis.

DESIGN
[HeLa cells]: Cells were transfected with control or cdr2 siRNAs and then cells were synchronized in mitosis using a sequential thymidine/nocodazole block.  Cells were subsequently released from nocodazole block and after 3 hours RNA was harvested for microarray analysis [Rat-1 wild type (TGR) and c-myc null (15.19) cells]: Cells were transfected with control or cdr2 siRNAs and then cells were synchronized in mitosis using a sequential thymidine/nocodazole block.  Cells were then subsequently released from nocodazole block and after 3 hours RNA was harvested for microarray analysis
