TITLE
Estrogen- and Myc-regulated genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen-responsive genes were identified by transcript profiling of estrogen-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The gene expression profile generated after estrogen treatment was compared with that following inducible expression of c-Myc or c-Zip (a deletion mutant of c-Myc that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domains) in clonal MCF-7 cell lines. Keywords: Single time point
