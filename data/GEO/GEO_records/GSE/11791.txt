TITLE
Estrogen- and Myc-regulated genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen-responsive genes were identified by transcript profiling of estrogen-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The gene expression profile generated after estrogen treatment was compared with that following inducible expression of c-Myc or c-Zip (a deletion mutant of c-Myc that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domains) in clonal MCF-7 cell lines. Keywords: Single time point

DESIGN
RNA was collected in three independent experiments, each including parental MCF-7 cells treated with 17b-estradiol (E2) or ethanol (EtOH), zinc-treated p∆MT-c-Myc cells, zinc-treated p∆MT-c-Zip cells and zinc-treated empty vector (p∆MT) cells. Cells were arrested for 48 h with 10 nM ICI 182780 and then treated for 6 h with either 100 nM E2 or ethanol vehicle, or 75 mM zinc for the stably transfected cell lines.
