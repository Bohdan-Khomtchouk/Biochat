TITLE
SMORE-seq maps both ends of transcripts and identifies widespread promoter-associated non-coding RNA governed by TATA elements.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
SMORE-seq (Simultaneous Mapping Of RNA Ends by sequencing) is developted to simultaneously identify the strongest TSS (Transcription Start Site) and PAS (Polyadenylation Site)

DESIGN
SMORE-seq were performed in wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae
