TITLE
PPARD is a critical inhibitor of cartilage growth in external ears [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In this study, we uncover the molecular mechanism that PPARD transactive-deficient pigs have large-eared feature. Evidently from this work, PPARD plays a vital role on inhibiting cartilage growth by regulating the transcription of critical genes for chondrogenesis in ligand dependent manner; the activation of sPPARD speeds up apoptosis in CSPCs, terminal differentiation of chondroblasts and matrix degradation in auricular cartilage. The transactive-deficient PPARD has not the capability to slow down cartilage growth and consequently causes that ear size of carried animals increases at a high growth rate. As the role of PPARD in cartilage is similar in pigs, mice and humans, and since cartilage development is well-conserved in animals, our data helps to better understanding of cartilage development and treatment of cartilage-related diseases.

DESIGN
Examination of PPARD binding sites in auricular-derived primary cartilage cells from a 4-month-old Duroc × (Landrace × Large White) hybrid pig  (DLL pig).
