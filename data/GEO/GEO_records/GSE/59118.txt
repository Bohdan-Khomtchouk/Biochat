TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiling of serum-free and FBS treated adherent primary pancreatic TIC cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To induce a differentiated phenotype, primary pancreatic TIC cultures were grown in 10% FBS containing conditions. To analyze gene expression changes upon induction of a differentiated phenotype, total RNA of cells cultured in FBS containing conditions and parallel control cells cultured under serum-free conditions was isolated and comparative gene expression profiling was performed.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from four different patient derived cultures grown in serum-free or 10% FBS containing culture medium at passage 3 and passage 8
