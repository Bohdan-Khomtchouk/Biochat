TITLE
Illumina M450 profiling of human prostate cancer tissue and benign prostate tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina M450 profiling was conducted on clinically-annotated human prostate cancer tissue and benign prostate tissue

DESIGN
We measured genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 73 clinically-annotated fresh-frozen prostate tissues and 63 benign prostate tissues using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip array.
