ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluated aflatoxin B1-induced liver tumor promotion by H. hepaticus. Microarrays of liver and cecum from female mice were used to evaluate the individual and combined transcriptional effects of AFB1 and H. hepaticus Keywords: Tumor co-promotion study

DESIGN
C3H/HeN mice were inoculated with 7 ug/g BW AFB1 or vehicle IP at 10 days of age, and gavaged with H. hepaticus or broth at 3 weeks; necropsied at 40 weeks
