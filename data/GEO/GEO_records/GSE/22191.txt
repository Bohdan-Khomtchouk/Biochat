TITLE
Absolute expression level of Debaryomyces hansenii genes

ORGANISM
Debaryomyces hansenii

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Debaryomyces hansenii genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Debaryomyces hansenii cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe). RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Debaryomyces hansenii.
