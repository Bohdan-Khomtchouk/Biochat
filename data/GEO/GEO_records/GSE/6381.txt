TITLE
Early Gene Expression Profiles During Intraoperative Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion in Cardiac Surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Right ventricular samples were serially acquired during surgical repair of ventricular septal defect. Expression profiling revealed three patterns of gene expression: (1) increased expression above control levels within one hour of cardioplegic arrest, with further amplification during early reperfusion; (2) increased expression limited to the reperfusion phase; and (3) reduced expression during reperfusion. Keywords: VSD Patients

DESIGN
4 replicates each: Stage2, End-ischemia Stage1, Immediately post-cardioplegic arrest Stage3, After 5 min. Reperfusion
