TITLE
An aging-like phenotype occurs in Tif1γ-/- hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether an accelerated aging-like phenotype occurs in hematopoiesis of young Tif1γ-/- mice (4 months old), we purified 200,000 hematopoietic stem cells (LSK: Lineage negative, Sca1+, c-Kit+) from Tif1γ-/- mice and performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We compared this transcriptome to physiological aging by creating two other RNAseq libraries from young (4 months old) and old (20 months old) wild type mice.

DESIGN
RNAseq study on young Tif1γ-/- mice (4 months old), young wild type mice (4 months old) and old wild type mice (20 months old).
