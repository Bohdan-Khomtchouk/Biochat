TITLE
Differentially Expressed microRNAs in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Microvesicles in Young and Older Rats and Their Effect on Tumor Growth Factor-Î²1-mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in HK2 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiles of the Young-MSC-MVs and Old-MSC-MVs were analyzed with a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based array of the whole rat genome. Further analysis revealed the expression of miR-344a, miR-133b-3p, miR-294, miR-423-3p, and miR-872-3p was significantly downregulated in Old-MSC-MVs than in Young-MSC-MVs (p < 0.05).

DESIGN
miRCURY LNA Array (v.18.0) was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in BM-MSC-MVs of 3-month-old and 24-month-old Fisher344 rats.

PLATFORM
