TITLE
Experiment 1: Overexpression experiments at 30% epiboly MZspg and WT embryos with or without protein synthesis inhibition

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Overexpression experiments with or without protein synthesis inhibition were performed to investigate transcriptional targets of Klf4, FoxD3, and Nanog-like in the blastula stage embryos (4.7 hours postfertilization) of wild type or MZspg background.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Cy3 and Cy5 channels were splitted in Genedata Expressionist and Analyst software, quantile normalised and used for independent comparisons.

PLATFORM
