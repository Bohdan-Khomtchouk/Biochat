TITLE
Modulation of primary cell function of host Pseudomonas bacteria by conjugative plasmid pCAR1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas

SUMMARY
Impacts of plasmid carriage on its host cell were comprehensively analyzed using conjugative plasmid pCAR1 in the three different kinds of hosts, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and P. fluorescens Pf0-1. Various analyses of the host phenotype showed that pCAR1 carriage reduced host fitness, swimming motility, and resistances to osmotic- or pH-stress, and brought about the alterations of primary metabolic capacities in the TCA cycle or those several steps away from the TCA cycle in the host cells. Growth phase-dependent transcriptome analyses were performed with the classification of the annotated genes based on their identities among the three hosts and their putative functions. pCAR1 carriage affected host transcriptome more greatly at the transition and stationary phases in each host. The transcriptome responses were more similar between KT2440 and PAO1 than between other host combinations, and many genes, such as for ribosomal proteins, F-type ATPase, and RNAP core, in both strains were commonly not suppressed in their stationary phases. These responses may have resulted in the reduction of host fitness, motility, and stress resistances. Host-specific responses to plasmid carriage were transcriptional changes of genes on putative prophage or foreign DNA regions. The extent of the impacts in host phenotypes and transcriptomes was similarly the largest in KT2440 and the lowest in Pf0-1. The host alterations controlled by pCAR1 carriage are important for understanding the fate of the plasmid and its host, plasmid maintenance, expression of plasmid genes, the host cell physiology, and host survivability in the environment.
