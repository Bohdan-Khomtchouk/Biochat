TITLE
Human ECFCs: Cord Blood vs Peripehral Blood ECFCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling was carried out using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (5th gen - hsa, mmu & rno). microRNA profiling of CB and PB-derived ECFCs from 3 independent donors from each cell source. To identify and understand the regulation of endothelial cell functions through comparing miRNA expression profiling of cord blood (CB) derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and peripheral blood (PB) ECFCs

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, CB vs PB-derived ECFCs. 3 independent donors per ECFC source.

PLATFORM
GPL21880 miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (5th gen - hsa, mmu & rno) [miRBase version 15.0 + miRPlus]
