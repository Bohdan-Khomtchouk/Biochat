TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aueruginosa NCTC8626 treated with and without manuka honey

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit growth in Pseudomonas aueruginosa, the mode of action is currently unclear. We used microarrays to detail the difference in global gene expresson following treatment of cells with honey. We identified distinct classe of up and down regulated genes

DESIGN
Pseudomonas aueruginosa were harvested 4 hours after exposure to treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Control and honey treated cells were investigates, three biological replicates were used for each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
