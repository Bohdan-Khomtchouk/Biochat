TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in the liver by naive CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that homeostatic interactions between naïve CD4+ T cells and resident cells in the liver generates signals that modulate gene expression in this organ. To test this hypothesis, we identified genes that are regulated by the presence of naïve CD4+ T cells by using a whole genome microarray to compare transcript levels in liver tissue from non-infected RAG-1-/-, OT-II/RAG-1-/- and wild type mice (Fig. 3). Using this approach, we identified 175 genes that were differentially expressed only in the presence of naïve CD4+ T cells. Keywords: Genotype comparison
