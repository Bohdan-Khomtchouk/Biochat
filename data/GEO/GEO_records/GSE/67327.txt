TITLE
microRNA Induction of Fatal Differentiation Programs is a Context-selective Vulnerability in Ovarian Cancer Cells [PEO1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in ovarian cancer cells with and without overexpression of the miRNA mir-124 which will provide data about genes possibly directly regulated by miR-124.  Also, analysis of gene expression in ovarian cancer cells with and without knockdown of the homeodomain transcription factor SIX4 (a target of miR-124) which will provide data about genes possibly directly regulated by SIX4

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PEO1 cells transfected with miRNA mimic negative control (miNC), miR-124 mimic, siRNA negative control (siNC) oligo, or siRNA targeting the SIX4 gene (siSIX4) 72 hours post-transfection

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
