TITLE
Identification of the differences between gene expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF cell line) infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The similarity of Lyme borreliosis to other diseases and the complex pathogenesis cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Changes at the cellular and molecular level after Borrelia sp. infection remain still poorly understood. Therefore, the present study focused on the gene expression in human dermal fibroblasts in differentiation of infection with Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto spirochetes.

DESIGN
For microarray analysis 10 samples were used: 3 control samples - K, 2 samples of NHDF cells infected with Borrelia garinii - G, 2 samples of NHDF cells infected with Borrelia afzelii - A and 3 samples of NHDF cells infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto - SS.
