TITLE
The transcription factor CDX2 maintains active enhancer in intestinal villus cells in vivo (ChIP-seq data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We established whether partner transcription factor binding, chromatin structure, or gene expression is compromised upon loss of partner factors cdx2 or hnf4a in mouse intestinal villi. This metadata file describes the ChIP-seq componant of that data

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelia were collected from mouse jejunum using EDTA-based chelation and ChIP-seq was performed, followed by next generation sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
