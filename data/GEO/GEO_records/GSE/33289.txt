TITLE
Expression data in wild type and NsrR-null mutant of B. subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
NsrR strongly represses transcription of small numbers of genes in the absence of NO NsrR moderately represses transcription of large numbers of genes in a less NO-sensitive manner

DESIGN
The wild-type and mutant cells were cultured anaerobically in the presence and absence of NO.  Biological triplicate samples were used to isolate RNA.
