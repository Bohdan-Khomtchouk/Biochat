TITLE
CTCF functions as a chromatin insulator in the HoxA cluster during neurogenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we sought to analyze how the transcriptome of WT, Δ5|6, and Δ5|6:7|9 cells vary during differentiation of ESCs into cervical motor neurons

DESIGN
3 lines (WT, Δ5|6, Δ5|6:7|9)
