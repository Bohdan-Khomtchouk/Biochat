TITLE
Gene expression response of Medicago truncatula roots treated with symbiotic lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs)

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Legumes interact with soil microbes, leading to the development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots. While nodule initiation by diffusible lipochitooligosaccharide (LCO) Nod-factors of bacterial origin (Nod-LCOs) is well characterized, diffusible AM fungal signals were only recently identified as sulphated and non-sulphated LCOs (sMyc-LCOs and nsMyc-LCOs). Applying Myc-LCOs in parallel to Nod-LCOs, we used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to the external application of symbiotic LCOs.
