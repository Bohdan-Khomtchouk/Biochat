TITLE
Effect of  chronic valproic acid treatment on hepatic gene expression profile in Wfs1 knockout mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim of the present study was to compare the effect of chronic VPA treatment in wild type and Wfs1 knockout mice on hepatic gene expression profile. Wild type, Wfs1 heterozygous and homozygous mice were treated with VPA for three months (300 mg/kg i.p. daily) and gene expression profiles in liver were evaluated using Affymetrix Mouse GeneChip 1.0 st arrays.

DESIGN
male wild-type and Wfs1 mutant (+/- and -/-) mice were treated with valproic acid (300 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle (saline, 10ml/kg i.p.) for 12 weeks starting from age 4 to 6 weeks. At age 16 to 18 weeks mice were killed, RNA extracted from the liver and analysed using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Expression of few genes was verified using RT-PCR. There were 8 animals in every group, 48 animals total.
