TITLE
Evolution of the herbivore associated elicitor induced early defence signalling networks in Nicotiana

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identifying whether FAC-induced early defence signalling genes were regulated by JA

DESIGN
Gene expression in leaves of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-AOC plants was measured at 30 min after elicitation with FAC (C18:3-Glu) and water (control). Three biological replicates were performed with both wild type and  ir-AOC plants. In total 12 microarraies were hybridized.
