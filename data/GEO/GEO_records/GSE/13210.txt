TITLE
Expression of the TM4SF member CD9 on the human Burkitts lymphoma cell line Raji

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of the TM4SF member CD9 on the human Burkitts lymphoma cell line Raji induced increased cell proliferation, motilty and adhesion to fibronectin. CD9 promoted increases in Raji cell proliferation was dependent upon histone deacetyalase (HDAC) activity as treatment with HDAC inhibitors trichostain A or cucurmin attenuated CD9 mediated increases in Raji cell proliferation. Gene expression of Raji cells stably expressing human CD9 via transfection with expression vector PRVCMVCD9 was compared with corresponding Mock transfected cell by microarray analysis using the Affymetrix U133 2.0 platform.
