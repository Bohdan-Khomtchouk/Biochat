TITLE
Genome-wide time series analysis of gastrin induced gene expression in AR42J cells with and without protein synthesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression time series experiments are an important approach to studying a cells response to a given stimulus, as they enable capturing of the dynamics of the response. Moreover, information about the dynamics of the system is an important prerequisite for inferences on interactions between its components. We have performed extensive microarray-based genome-wide gene expression analyses up to 14h of the response to gastrin in AR42J adenocarcinoma cells. The gastrin reponse was also investigated in presence of the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide. The rat cell line AR42J derived from pancreatic duct has the feature of pluripotency of the precursor cells of the gut endoderm. Furthermore, AR42J cells express gastrin receptors endogenously and are therefore frequently used as a model system to study gastrin responses. The hormone gastrin is the central regulator of gastric acid secretion and in addition plays a prominent role in regulation of growth and differentiation of gastric and colonic mucosa. Hypergastrinaemia has been linked to development of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours (NE-GI) and, in conjugation with additional factors such as inflammation, to development of gastric adenocarcinoma (GA)
