TITLE
Susceptibility to photo-oxidative damage of mice lacking the Rod derived Cone Viability Factor gene Nxnl1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor is a trophic factor of the thioredoxins family that promotes the survival of cone photoreceptors. It is encoded by the nucleoredoxin-like gene 1 Nxnl1 which also encodes by alternative splicing for RdCVFL, for a thioredoxin enzyme that interacts with the protein TAU. The role of thioredoxins in the defense mechanism against oxidation led us to examine the retinal phenotype of the Nxnl1-/- mouse after photo-oxidative stress.

DESIGN
In total 16 samples were analyzed, they represent two different genotypes (wt/wt, ko/ko) both on pure BALB/c background and two doses of light that were tested in triplicate each.
