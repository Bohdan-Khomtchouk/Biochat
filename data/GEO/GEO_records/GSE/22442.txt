TITLE
The COP9 signalosome mediates transcriptional and metabolic response during fungal development

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
The COP9 signalosome complex (CSN) is a crucial regulator of ubiquitin ligases. Defects in CSN result in embryonic impairment and death in higher eukaryotes, whereas the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans survives without CSN, but is unable to complete sexual development. We investigated overall impact of CSN activity on A. nidulans cells by combined transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis. Absence of csn5/csnE affects transcription of at least 15 % of genes during development, including numerous oxidoreductases. csnE deletion leads to changes in the fungal proteome indicating impaired redox regulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. CSN promotes the formation of asexual spores by regulating developmental hormones produced by PpoA and PpoC dioxygenases. We identify more than 100 metabolites, including orsellinic acid derivatives, accumulating preferentially in the csnE mutant. We also show that CSN is required to activate glucanases and other cell wall recycling enzymes during development. These findings suggest a dual role for CSN during development:  it is required early for protection against oxidative stress and hormone regulation and is later essential for control of secondary metabolism and cell wall rearrangement.

DESIGN
Two genotypes of A. nidulans (Wildtype and Delta-csnE mutant) were compared in four different growth stages (vegetativ14h, vegetativ20h, asex48h and sex48h). Per growth stage we considered 8 microarrays of 2 biological replicates with direct comparisons including dye swaps between the genotypes.
