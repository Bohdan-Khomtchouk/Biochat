TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of Jmjd6- and Jmjd4-depleted mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Emerging evidence suggests Jumonji domain-containing proteins are epigenetic regulators in diverse biological processes including cellular differentiation and proliferation. RNA interference-based analyses combined with gene expression profiling can effectively characterize the cellular functions of these enzymes. We found that the depletion of Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) and its paralog protein Jumonji domain-containing protein 4 (Jmjd4) individually by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) slowed cell proliferation of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We subsequently performed gene expression profiling on both Jmjd6- and Jmjd4-depleted mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
We anaylzed control shRNA-treated cells, Jmjd6- and Jmjd4- depleted cells using Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Two biological replicates were performed (total 6 samples). Array data was processed by Affymetrix Expression Console.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version] GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
