TITLE
Gene Expression Patterns of Endothelial Cell Network Formation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lamellar co-cultures of human aorta-derived smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cultured with cord-blood derived endothelial cells (ECs) are an in vitro model for tissue engineered blood vessels and in-growth of endothelial cells into cardiovascular repair devices. The ratio of endothelial cells to smooth muscle cells can control the EC pattern of growth and differentiation.  Low density ECs form capillary-like networks in co-culture with SMCs whereas high density ECs become confluent across the top surface of the SMCs.  To understand the molecular mechanisms that govern network formation, used microarray analysis of ECs purified from 1) networks, 2) confluent layers compared to 3) ECs in monoculture.

DESIGN
To understand the molecular mechanisms that govern endothelial cell network formation, we used microarray analysis of RNA isolated from endothelial cells in either in monoculture or lamellar culture with smooth muscle cells.
