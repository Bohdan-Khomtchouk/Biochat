TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of one rhesus macaque at day 0 and day 7 post-exposure to aerosolized Ebola virus

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression data were obtained from archived plasma from one rhesus macaque exposed to aerosolized Ebola virus.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression profiling using RT-PCR with the Exiqon microRNA Ready-to-Use PCR, Human panel I+II, V3.R (catalog number 203612). Plasma was obtained from one rhesus macaque challenged with aerosolized Ebola virus. Archived plasma from day 0 and day 7 post-exposure were used. Three technical replicates were run at each time point.
