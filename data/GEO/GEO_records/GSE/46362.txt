TITLE
Expression data from ETV6-RUNX1-positive Reh leukemic cells after overexpression of miR-125b, miR-100 and miR-99a levels in different combinations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Combined overexpression of miR-125b with miR-99a and/or miR-100 induced VCR resistance in ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemic cells Reh. We used microarrays to detail the global changes in gene expression of Reh cells upon enforced expression of miR-125 per se compared with combination of overexpression of miR-125b, miR-100 and/or miR-99a

DESIGN
MiR-99a and/or miR-100 were transiently overexpressed in stable miR-125b-expressing and stable scrambled miR-control-expressing Reh cells. Cellular resistance to VCR was determined by MTT assay after incubating the cells with 9 ng/mL VCR for 3 days. Changes in the gene expression pattern of Reh cells induced by miRNAs overexpression were measured using Affymetrix Arrays.
