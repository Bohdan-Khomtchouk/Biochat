TITLE
The overall response of Paenibacillus larvae to bodily fluids of honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera).

ORGANISM
Paenibacillus larvae

SUMMARY
Paenibacillus larvae, the causal agent of American Foulbrood disease (AFB), affects honeybee health worldwide. The present study investigates the transcriptional response of this Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium to bodily fluids from honeybee larvae. Four different conditions were evaluated with a loop design: sampling of in vitro grown P. larvae cultures one or four hours after addition of larval fluids or BHIT-broth (C1, T1, C4, T4).

DESIGN
total of 16 samples, 4 independent samples per group, 4 groups (C1, C4, T1 and T4), loopdesign, dye swap

PLATFORM
GPL15243 Agilent-036300 Custom Paenibacillus larvae Array (Ag-P.Larvae)
