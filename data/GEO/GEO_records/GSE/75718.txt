TITLE
Deep sequencing data for PAM-SCANR tested CRISPR-Cas systems

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida

SUMMARY
In this work, we analyzed recognized PAM sequences from four CRISPR-Cas systems: E. coli I-E, B. halodurans I-C, S. thermophilus CR1 II-A, and F. novicida V. Cells containing functional PAMs were sorted using FACS and subsequently sequenced.

DESIGN
Ranking of recognized PAMs from a positive screen
