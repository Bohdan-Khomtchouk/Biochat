TITLE
Gene expression of liver tissue from Pcyt2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pcyt2 defient mice has metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. We used microarray to study the gene expression of these mice to understand the global program of gene expression underlying the metabolic syndrome, obesity and insulin resistance.

DESIGN
2 month-old Pcyt2 deficient mice and age matched control mice liver tissues were choosen for RNA extraction and gene expression using Affymetrix microarray.
