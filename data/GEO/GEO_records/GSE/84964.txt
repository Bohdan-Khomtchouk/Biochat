TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of longissimus muscle tissues from Qianhua Mutton Merino and Small Tail Han sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We aimed to evaluate the transcriptome regulators associated with muscle growth and development between the Qianhua Mutton Merino (QHMM) and  Small Tail Han (STH) sheep.We used RNA-Seq to obtain the transcriptome profiles of the longissimus muscle from the QHMM and STH.The genome-wide transcriptome analysis of QHMM and STH muscle in present study is reported first time.

DESIGN
Muscle mRNA profiles of Qianhua Mutton Merino (QHMM) and  Small Tail Han (STH) sheep were generated by deep sequencing, three replicates in each sheep breed, using ABI Ion Proton instrument .
