TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of donor cells, low passage episomal stromal-primed myeloid iPSC, and intermediate passage fibroblast iPSC.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of (a) human embryonic stem cells, (b) low passage episomal stromal-primed myeloid iPSC, (c) intermediate passage fibroblast iPSC, and (d) samples of corresponding donor cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from indicated donor cells, hESC, or iPSC, and analyzed on Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchips. A single sample of each cell line was used for this analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16700 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip [gene symbol; HumanHT-12_V3_0_R3_11283641_A]
