TITLE
Small RNA Solexa sequencing of mouse CD11c+Ia high and CD11c+Ia low cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied Illumina massively parallel signature sequencing to identify miRNomes in CD11c+Ia high and CD11c+Ia low cells.The miRNomes of these DC subsets will contribute to investigate the significance of miRNAs in DC immunobiology.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNome in CD11c+Ia high and CD11c+Ia low cells . All two mouse cell types.

PLATFORM
