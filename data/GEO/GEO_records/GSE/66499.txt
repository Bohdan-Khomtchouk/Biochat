TITLE
Validation of an Airway Gene Expression Classifier for Lung Cancer in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Bronchoscopy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: In patients with suspicious pulmonary lesions, bronchoscopy is frequently non-diagnostic. This often results in additional invasive testing, including surgical biopsy, although many patients have benign disease.  We sought to validate an airway gene-expression classifier for lung cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy.   METHODS: Two multicenter prospective studies (AEGIS 1 and 2) enrolled 1357 current or former smokers undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer.  Bronchial epithelial cells were collected from normal appearing mucosa in the mainstem bronchus during bronchoscopy. Patients without a definitive diagnosis from bronchoscopy were followed for 12 months. A gene-expression classifier was used to assess the risk of lung cancer, and its performance was evaluated.  RESULTS: A total of 298 patients from AEGIS 1 and 341 from AEGIS 2 met criteria for analysis.  Bronchoscopy was non-diagnostic for cancer in 272 of 639 patients (43%; 95%CI, 39-46%). The gene expression classifier correctly identified 431 of 487 patients with cancer (89% sensitivity; 95%CI, 85-91%), and 72 of 152 patients without cancer (47% specificity; 95%CI, 40-55%). The combination of the classifier and bronchoscopy had a sensitivity of 97% (95%CI, 95-98%), which was independent of size, location, stage, and histological subtype of lung cancer.  In patients with an intermediate pre-test risk (10-60%) of lung cancer, the NPV of the classifier was 91% (95%CI 75-98%).  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an intermediate risk of lung cancer and a non-diagnostic bronchoscopy, a gene-expression classification of “low-risk” warrants consideration of a more conservative diagnostic approach that could reduce unnecessary invasive testing in patients with benign disease.
