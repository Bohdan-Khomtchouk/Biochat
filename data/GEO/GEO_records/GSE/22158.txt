TITLE
Expression of the Stress-Related Genes for Glutathione S-Transferase and Ascorbate Peroxidase in the Most-Glycinin-Deficient Soybean Cultivar Tousan205 during Seed Maturation.

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Global analyses on gene expression profiles in two soybean species, Nanahomare and Tamahomare was performed using DNA microarray technique.  Nanahomare is glycinin deficient species, and is high in free amino acid content.  Tamahomare is parent species of Nanahomare. In Nanahomare, stress related genes glutathione S-transferase and ascorbate peroxidase had higher expression than in Tamahomare, which suggests glycinin-deficiency caused stress in soy seeds, and that it lead Nanahomare to increase in free amino acid content. Keywords: storage protein deficiency

DESIGN
Soybean seeds were selected at two stages of Bean 5mm and Full-size for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain difference in gene expression between two species and find out which gene's or gene group's expression changes.
