TITLE
A Subset of Genes Can Distinguish between Bortezomib Responsive Versus Bortezomib Resistant Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile (GEP) was analyzed from cultured bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with bortezomib responsive versus bortezomib resistant myeloma after 6-8 hours incubation in vitro with bortezomib 2 µg/ml or with PBS. Case D also had a fresh BM sample taken 75 minutes after IV injection of bortezomib.

DESIGN
Comparative gene expression profiling of cultured bone marrow samples from from patients with bortezomib responsive versus bortezomib resistant myeloma after 6-8 hours incubation in vitro with bortezomib 2 µg/ml or with PBS.
