TITLE
Expression data for EGFR TKI resistant EGFR-mutated Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intratumoral heterogeneity in EGFR mutant NSCLC results in divergent resistance mechanisms in response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition We used microarrays to investigate the  gene expression underlying EGFR TKI resistance with a mesenchymal phenotype.

DESIGN
Total 4 samples in triplicates were analyzed.
