TITLE
Whole-transcriptome gene expression profiling in TRPC1-silenced hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effects of TRPC1 silencing on whole-transcriptome gene expression were determined in Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells using whole-transcriptome gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile in TRPC1-silencing vector transfected Huh7 cells was compared to control cells transfected with empty vector.
