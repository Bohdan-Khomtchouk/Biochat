TITLE
Hdac3 Interaction with p300 Histone Acetyltransferase Regulates the Oligodendrocyte and Astrocyte Lineage Fate Switch (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Establishment and maintenance of CNS glial cell identity ensures proper brain development and function, yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying glial fate control remain poorly understood. Here we show that the histone deacetylase Hdac3 controls oligodendrocyte-specification gene Olig2 expression, and functions as a molecular switch for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte lineage determination. Our data suggest that Hdac3 cooperates with p300 to prime and maintain oligodendrogenic programs while inhibiting Stat3-mediated astrogliogenesis, and thereby regulate phenotypic commitment at the point of oligodendrocyte-astrocytic fate decision.

DESIGN
Examination of Hdac3 and p300 genomewide occupancy in differentiating oligodendrocytes
