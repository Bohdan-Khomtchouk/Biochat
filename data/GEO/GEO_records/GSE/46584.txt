TITLE
Expression data from sympathetic nervous system of KI Alk F1178L mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal neoplasm that remains of dramatic prognosis in its aggressive forms. Activating mutations of the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor have been identified in sporadic and familial cases of this cancer. We generated knock-in mice carrying an F1178L Alk mutation corresponding to the ALK F1174L mutation observed in neuroblastoma patients We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the impact of ALK F1178L mutation on sympathetic nervous system ganglia

DESIGN
We selected sympathetic nervous system ganglia (superior cervical and stellate ganglia) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We profiled a total number of 12 Po (4 Wt; 4 Hz; 4 Ho) and 5 P18 (3 Wt; 2 Hz)
