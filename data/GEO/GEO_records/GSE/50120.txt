TITLE
Runx3 function in splenic NK cells activated in vivo by IL-15.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NK cells are innate immune cells that recognize and kill foreign, virally-infected and tumor cells without the need for prior immunization. NK expansion following viral infection is IL-2 or IL-15-dependent.

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 regulated genes, NK cells were isolated from spleen of  IL15/Ra injected WT and Runx3-/- mice and sorted to obtain 3 subpopulations of immature (CD27) and mature (DP and CD11c) NK cells.
