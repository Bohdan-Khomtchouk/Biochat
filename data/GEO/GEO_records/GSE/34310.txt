TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in primary prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulated expression of miRNAs contributes to prostate cancer progression. This study is aimed to identify which miRNA(S) is (are) asociated with prostate cancer aggressiveness.

DESIGN
Prostate cancer tissues and matched adjacent normal tissue were used to isolate total RNA. miRNA expressions were analyzed by miRNA Microarray assay.
