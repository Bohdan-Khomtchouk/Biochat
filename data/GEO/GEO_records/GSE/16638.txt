TITLE
Ambion and Exiqon miRNA profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Influenza A virus induces endogenous miR-141 to undermine MxA antiviral activity

DESIGN
color-swap dye-reversal In order to compensate specific effects of the dyes and to ensure statistically relevant data analysis, a color-swap dye-reversal was performed. Ratio profiles comprising single hybridizations were combined in an error-weighted fashion to create ratio experiments. A 2-fold change expression cut-off for ratio experiments was applied together with anti-correlation of color-swapped ratio profiles was applied, rendering the microarray analysis highly significant (P-value > 0.01), robust and reproducible.
