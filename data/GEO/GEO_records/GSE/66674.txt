TITLE
Identification of genes regulated during passaging of mouse osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the genes that are regulated during passaging of the parental mouse Dunn osteosarcoma cells with low metastatic potential and Dunn-derived LM8 cells with increased metastatic potential, we performed global gene expression profiling in early and late passage cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from early and late passage cells cultured in three independent replicates for each condition. Cy3-labeled cRNA was synthesized and hybridized to Agilent mouse 4 x 44K microarrays. Raw data, obtained after array image analysis were normalized and used to retrieve differentially expressed genes in early and late passage cells.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
