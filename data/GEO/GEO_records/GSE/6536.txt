TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression variation in 210 unrelated HapMap individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extensive studies are currently being performed to associate disease susceptibility with one form of genetic variation, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In recent years another type of common genetic variation has been characterised, namely structural variation, including copy number variations (CNVs). To determine the overall contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes we have performed association analyses of expression levels of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in individuals who are part of the International HapMap project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6% and 17.7% of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, respectively, but the signals from the two types of variation had little overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans. Keywords: gene expression
