TITLE
Feeding with miR-184 affects the mRNA expression profile of queen larvae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
By comparing mRNA profiles of the two groups of bee larvae (treated by miR-184 and water), we found that there were 279 mRNAs which were differently expressed between treated and control larvae (ratio > 2 and p < 0.01), of which 200 mRNAs were down-regulated in treated larvae, and 79 mRNAs were down-regulated in controls.

DESIGN
To further study the biological function and potential pathways of microRNAs with RNAi phenotypes, we measured mRNA profiles of bee larvae fed with miR-184 (treated) and water (control).
