TITLE
Increased CD226 Expression on CD8+ T cells in Patients with Systemic Sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by vascular damage, and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Because activated and oligoclonally expanded CD8+ T cells can be detected in peripheral blood and lung of SSc patients, effector memory CD8+ T cells may play a critical role for organ involvement in SSc; however, the pathogenic functions of effector memory CD8+ T cells remain incompletely understood. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis of the sort-purified effector memory CD8+ T cells from SSc patients and healthy controls, and showed that the expression of genes related to immune response and cell adhesion, including CD226 (also known as DNAX accessory molecule-1, DNAM-1), was significantly altered. Moreover, detailed analysis of CD226 revealed that CD226highCD8+ T cells were increased in SSc patients (mean, 50.7%) compared with healthy controls (32.9%) and were appreciably associated with the severity of skin sclerosis and interstitial lung disease. Further, CD226highCD8+ T cells from SSc patients produced abundant IL-13 and were positively correlated with the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T cells against HUVECs. Finally, the neutralization of CD226 impaired IL-13 production and cytolysis against HUVECs. These findings indicate that upregulated CD226 expression on CD8+ T cells reflects disease severity and are involved in SSc pathogenesis via the production of profibrotic IL-13 and endothelial cell injury, and that CD226 may be a useful target in the treatment of SSc.

DESIGN
We first purified effector memory CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+CD45RO+CD62L+ cells) from peripheral blood by cell sorting and subsequently performed cDNA microarray analysis of the sort-purified effector memory CD8+ T cells from 9 SSc patients and 5 healthy controls.
