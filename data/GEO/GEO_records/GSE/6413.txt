TITLE
Profiling protease and protease inhibitor gene expression in tumors and their microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assist in the identification of proteases, their endogenous inhibitors, and proteins that interact with proteases or proteolytic pathways in biological tissues, a dual species oligonucleotide microarray has been developed in conjunction with Affymetrix, Inc. To investigate the performance of the array, gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas. The Hu/Mu ProtIn array is a valuable discovery tool for the identification of components of human and murine proteolytic pathways in health and disease, and has particular utility in the determination of cellular origins of proteases and protease inhibitors in xenograft models of human cancer. Keywords: gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas

DESIGN
Commercial pan human and mouse total RNA replicate samples (n=3) were profiled. In addition, human ductal stage II or III breast carcinoma biopsies (n=18) were compared to normal human breast biopsies (n=13). Spontaneous spontaneous murine mammary carcinomas from MMTV-PyMT+(FVB/n) (n=8) and MMTV-PyMT+/uPARAP-/-(FVB/n) (n=2) transgenic mice were compared to normal mouse mammary fat pads (n=4; female Rag-1 tm1Mom retired breeders at > 6 weeks post lactation). In vitro cultures of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells (n=3) and MDA-MB-231 orthotopic xenografts (n=3) were profiled. The xenografts were compared to normal mammary fat pads. A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (n=2), A549 orthotopic xenografts (n=3) and normal mouse lung tissue (n = 3) were profiled.
