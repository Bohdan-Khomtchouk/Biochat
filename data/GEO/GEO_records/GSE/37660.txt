TITLE
Transcription profile of adipose-resident macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is commonly-recognized that hematopoietic cells residing in adipose tissue (AT) exhibit a broad range of physiological functions for maintenance of homeostasis and remodeling and repair of tissues aside from the involvement in inflammation. We evaluated the cell composition of hematopoietic cells in human non-obese AT and analyzed AT-resident macrophages in detail.

DESIGN
Liposuction aspirates were obtained from healthy donors undergoing liposuction of the abdomen and thighs. CD34-positive AT resident macrophages (ATMs), CD34-negative ATMs and adipose stromal cells were sorted from aspirated AT by a multiparameter fluorescent-activated cell sorter. Circulating monocytes were also sorted from peripheral blood.These 4 condition were analysed transcription profile.
