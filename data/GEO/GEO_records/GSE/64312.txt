TITLE
Genome-wide RING1B binding in Fbxl10 overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells at day 2 of differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed RING1B binding regions in 3T3-L1 cell lines transduced with the retroviral vector for V5-tagged Fbxl10 or its dF-box mutant.

DESIGN
RING1B ChIP-seq in empty, Fbxl10-1, and dF-box mutant vector transduced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, in duplicate, and V5-Fbxl10 ChIP-seq in Fbxl10 overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells
