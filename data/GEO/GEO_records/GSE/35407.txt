TITLE
Gene expression data from isolated white winter wheat embryos at physiological maturity, environment 2 of 2.

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Gene expression was measured in isolated wheat embryos at physiological maturity. The gene expression measurements were done across a doubled haploid white winter wheat population between the variety Cayuga and the variety Caledonia (CxC). Data can be used for mapping gene expression QTL (eQTL). These data are from the second (Ketola 2005) of two field environments. Different target labeling was used so the environments are contained in two separate series.

DESIGN
The design was a two-channel dye-swap reference design with bulked total RNA from pre-anthesis wheat spikes serving as the reference. Normalization was done using the TIGR MIDAS suite using blockwise LOWESS smoothing and variance normalization. Between slide variance normalization was also done for all slides so direct comparisons could be made. Dye-swap was submitted unmerged to facilitate flexibility in downstream processing.
