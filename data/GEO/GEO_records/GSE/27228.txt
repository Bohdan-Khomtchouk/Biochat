X-96-23 had 5 groups. Each of 4 groups had a different treatment type and there was also a control group. A total of 16 samples was sent for micro array analysis. Three treatment groups and the control group were used for analysis. The treatments were CEE; CEE+MPA; and OD14-HIGH. There are four samples from each of these three treatment groups and four control samples. The OD14-HIGH and the treatment not analyzed-OD14-LOW--were independent treatments for another study.
