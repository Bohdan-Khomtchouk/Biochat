TITLE
Pfizer Molecular Profile Data for Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Baseline gene expression for cell lines growing in culture were measured by Affymetrix U133Plus2 arrays.  Copy Number Variation for selected cell lines was also measured.

DESIGN
Baseline gene expression for cell lines growing in culture were measured by Affymetrix U133Plus2 arrays.  Three different sources of arrays were combined. Arrays were from Pfizer, Wyeth Breast Panel, and Wyeth NCI50 subset of NCI60 cell lines.  CNV was determined by Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays.
