TITLE
PSI-seq to Identify Sites of Pseudouridylation in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using a technique based on the ability of CMC to specifically label pseudouridines and to stop reverse transcriptase, we provide a transcriptome-wide map of pseudouridylation in S. cerevisiae under log phase and heat shock conditions

DESIGN
4 conditions: log phase (2x), heat shock, and stationary phase. For each condition, there are 4 libraries: natural RNA + or - CMC treatment and in vitro transcribed RNA + or - CMC treatment

PLATFORM
GPL9377 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
