Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series of experiments will serve as quality control for NIH registered human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines. For example, hES cell marker genes, such as POU5F1, SOX2 and NANOG, should have high expression levels, while differentiation markers, such as NEUROD1 and PAX6, should have low expression levels. The difference between different stem cell lines should be revealed by the difference between expression levels of different markers. Keywords: Expression Chip
