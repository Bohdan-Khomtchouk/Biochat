ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This series of experiments will serve as quality control for NIH registered human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines. For example, hES cell marker genes, such as POU5F1, SOX2 and NANOG, should have high expression levels, while differentiation markers, such as NEUROD1 and PAX6, should have low expression levels. The difference between different stem cell lines should be revealed by the difference between expression levels of different markers. Keywords: Expression Chip

DESIGN
In this series of experiments, mRNAs from different human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are used as sample, while genomic DNA of hESC H1 cell line is used as reference. mRNAs are labeled with Cy5 and hESC H1 gDNA is labeled by Cy3. Normalized ratios of Cy5 VS Cy3 can reveal expression level of different genes in different hESC lines. hESC markers should have high levels of expression, while differetiation markers should have low levels of expression.
