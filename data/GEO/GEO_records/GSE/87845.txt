TITLE
Maternal dietary vitamin A deficiency and diet dependent liver gene expression in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Initiation of a vitamin A deficient diet in mid-gestation, maintained in the post-weaning diet is sufficient to cause liver and serum retinoid depletion. Wild type C57Bl/6J timed mated pregnant dams were administered either a defined vitamin A sufficient low fat (12 percent kcal from fat) diet or matched vitamin A deficient diet from embryonic day 10.5. Vitamin A sufficient offspring were weaned onto either a high fat diet (60 percent kcal from fat) or maintained on the low fat 12 percent kcal from fat diet for 11 weeks (14 weeks of age). Gestational vitamin A deficient offspring were maintained on the same vitamin A deficient diet until 14 weeks of age. The impact of the maternal diet  on a post-weaning high fat diet was compared to a standard maternal breeder diet followed by the post-weaning high fat diet.

DESIGN
Three comparison experiment. Liver expression of WT C57Bl/6J mice at 14 weeks of age from dams fed a particular maternal diet (X) and weaned onto a post-weaning diet (Y) such that diets are presented X-Y. Breeder diet - High fat diet compared to Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient - High fat diet. Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient - High fat diet compared to Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient - Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient. Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient - Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A sufficient compared to Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A deficient - Low fat 12 percent kcal vitamin A deficient.
