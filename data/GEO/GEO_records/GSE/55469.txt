TITLE
Jmjd3-mediated H3K27me3 dynamics orchestrate brown fat cell fate transition and regulate white fat plasticity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq to chart genome-wide maps of H3K27me3 in brown preadipocytes and mature brown adipocytes. We observed a subset of brown fat-specific genes, but not common fat genes or white fat-specific genes, possess the H3K27me3 mark in preadipocytes, and this mark is erased in mature adipocytes.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in brown preadipocytes and mature adipocytes.
