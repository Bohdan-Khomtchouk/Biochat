SUMMARY
Extensive molecular and prognostic characterization of wild-type MLL infant ALL. Background: Approximately 20% of all infant ALL cases carry wild-type (or germline) MLL genes. To date, wild-type MLL infant ALL patients are generally regarded as young pediatric precursor B-ALL patients, but extensive characterization of this specific patient group largely remains unacknowledged. Methods: We here studied a relatively large cohort of 78 wild-type MLL infant ALL samples, using clinical parameters, array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis, gene expression profiling, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and conventional sequencing. Findings: Wild-type MLL infant ALL patients are generally characterized by a lower incidence of favourable prognostic factors than pediatric (non-infant) B-ALL patients, and patients at high risk of therapy failure typically display an immature pro-B immunophenotype or respond poorly to prednisone. Using gene expression profiling, we found MEIS1 expression to additionally be highly predictive for clinical outcome in wild-type MLL infant ALL with a favourable prognosis in the wild-type MLL infants with low MEIS1 expression (DFS 88%% versus 50%, p=0â€¢01). Overall the incidence of DNA copy number variations and genetic abnormalities in genes involved in B-cell differentiation is lower in wild-type MLL infant ALL patients as compared with pediatric precursor B-ALL patients. Interpretation: Wild-type MLL infant ALL represents a highly heterogeneous patient group, which cannot be unified by one or a few known recurrent genomic aberrations. High-level MEIS1 expression and an immature pro-B immunophenotype in high-risk wild-type MLL infant ALL patients shows parallel with the unfavourable prognosis of MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients. In contrast, wild-type MLL infant ALL patients expressing lower levels of MEIS1 and displaying more differentiated (pre-B or common) phenotypes may well be more related to pediatric precursor B-ALL patients older than 1 year of age. We advocate that a treatment strategy in wild-type MLL infant ALL based on MEIS1 expression could be beneficial for improving survival.
