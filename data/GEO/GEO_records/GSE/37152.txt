TITLE
The regulation of cambial activity in Cunninghamia lanceolata involves extensive transcriptome remodeling

ORGANISM
Cunninghamia lanceolata

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from dormant, reactivating, and actively growing C. lanceolata vascular cambium using tangential cryosections  to generate the first transcriptome dynamics that may serve as a gene expression profile blueprint for cambium development and wood formation in the conifer.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in dormant, reactivating, and actively growing C. lanceolata vascular cambium, respectively

PLATFORM
GPL15423 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Cunninghamia lanceolata)
