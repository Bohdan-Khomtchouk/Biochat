TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing in Zea mays: landscape and genetic regulation

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of the maize alternative splicing landscape, including transcript discovery and mapping of genotype-dependent variations in alternative splicing using B73, Mo17 and the SX19 inbred mapping population

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 5 week old leaves of hydroponically grown maize plants and used to construct RNA seq libraries

PLATFORM
