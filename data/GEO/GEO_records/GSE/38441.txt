TITLE
WT vs MO-grnA injected: 16, 24, 48, 72 hpf trunk region of zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of zebrafish embryo comparing wild type untreated embryos with embryos injected with morpholino of zf-grna. This assay is used for determination of expression profiling of trunk muscle at 16, 24, 48, 72 hpf under GRN-A deficiency.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. MO-grnA treated cells. Biological replicates: each group contains 200 embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
