TITLE
Expression analysis of C. elegans wild-type N2 and rsks-1, daf-2, daf-2 rsks-1 and daf-16; daf-2 rsks-1 mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in C. elegans rsks-1, daf-2, daf-2 rsks-1 and daf-16; daf-2 rsks-1 mutant compared to the wild-type N2 strain.  The mutants have altered longevity phenotypes. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Di Chen, Patrick Wai-Lun Li, Benjamin A. Goldstein, Waijiao Cai, Emma Lynn Thomas, Fen Chen, Alan E. Hubbard, Simon Melov and Pankaj Kapahi, Germline Signaling Mediates the Synergistically Prolonged Longevity by Double Mutations in daf-2 and rsks-1 in C. elegans, Cell Reports (CELL-REPORTS-D-13-00388).

DESIGN
A 47 chip study using total RNAs from C. elegans wild-type N2 (9 replicates), rsks-1 mutant (9 replicates), daf-2 mutant (9 replicates), daf-2 rsks-1 double mutant (10 replicates) and daf-16; daf-2 rsks-1 triple mutant (10 replicates) measured gene expression levels at the whole genome level.
