TITLE
Expression data from rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing Myod and E-protein heterodimer and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are characterized by expression of myogenic specification genes, such as MyoD and/or Myf5, as well as their bHLH partners for heterodimerization, the E-proteins.  We have shown that expression of a forced heterodimer of MyoD with one of the E2A proteins, E12, leads to differentiation in a RMS cell culture model when exposed to low serum conditions. Keywords: RD expressing Myod~E heterodimers and controls

DESIGN
RD cells (a type of RMS) were retrovirally infected with either the MyoD~E heterodimer or an empty control vector, differentiated for 24 hours and then RNA collected.
