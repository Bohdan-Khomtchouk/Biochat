TITLE
Effect of infection with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Porphyromonas gingivalis on primary murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the biological mechanisms underlying a dampened immune response to Porphyromonas gingivalis, as compared to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans challenge, we infected primary BMDCs with either pathogen or left uninfected

DESIGN
Total RNA from uninfected BMDCs compared to BMDCs infected with either  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Porphyromonas gingivalis
