TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Bemisia tabaci reveals stage-specific gene expression signatures for thiamethoxam resistance

ORGANISM
Bemisia tabaci

SUMMARY
To investigated the stage-specific gene expression response to thiamethoxam in the Bemisia tabaci, we have designed the Agilent eArray platform to identify stage-regulated gene expression towards thiamethoxam exposure.

DESIGN
All the B biotype Bemisia tabaci were maintained on cabbage. Thiamethoxam susceptible (TH-S) was cultured without exposure to any chemical insecticides, Thiamethoxam resistance (TH-R) strain exhibited > 70-fold resistance to thiamethoxam in comparision to the TH-S strain. Eggs were incubated in 24hours collected as one sample. The fourth nymphs were collected as another sample. The one-day-old unmated adult females were collected as the third samples. Both of the samples were collected from the TH-R, TH-S strains, respectively

PLATFORM
GPL16291 Agilent-032260 Bemisia tabaci Oligo Microarray 15K G2545A (Probe Name version)
