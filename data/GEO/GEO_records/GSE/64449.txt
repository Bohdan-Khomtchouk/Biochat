TITLE
Gene expression data from Min6 cells grown in serum containing and serum free condtions following Hes3 knock down

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split (Hes3) is a member of the Hes/Hey gene family that regulates developmental processes in progenitor cells from various tissues. We demonstrated the Hes3 expression in mouse pancreatic tissue, suggesting it may have a role in modulating beta-cell function. We employed a transfection approach to address specific functions of Hes3. Hes3 RNA interference opposed the growth of the mouse insulinoma cell line Min6. Western blotting and PCR approaches specifically showed that Hes3 RNA interference opposes the expression of Pdx1 and insulin. Likewise, Hes3 knock down reduced evoked insulin release from Min6 cells.

DESIGN
We used microarray analysis to examine differences in gene expression when Hes3 expression was knocked down in cells grown under different culture condtions.
