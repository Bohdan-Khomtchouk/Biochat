TITLE
Gene expression data of interleukin-7-dependent and BCR-ABL1-transformed pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This analysis focused on identifying factors that protect pre-B cells against DNA double strand break (DSB)-mediated DNA damage stress during pre-B cell differentiation. Differentiation of pre-B cells including  immunoglobulin light chain gene recombination were performed by withdrawal of interleukin-7 (IL-7) from IL-7-dependent murine pre-B cells or by inhibition of the BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in BCR-ABL1-transformed pre-B cells. The BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor STI571 (Imatinib) was used for the inhibition of BCR-ABL1.

DESIGN
IL-7-dependent murine pre-B cells were either cultured in IL-7 (10 ng/ml) or induced to differentiate by withdrawal of IL-7. BCR-ABL1-transformed pre-B cells were either treated with 10 ÂµM STI571 (in absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IL-7) for 16 hours or cultured without STI571. Three samples for each condition were processed.
