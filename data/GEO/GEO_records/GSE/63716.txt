TITLE
Epigenetic analysis reveals the repressive function of MyoD during myogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify a subset of highly expressed genes related to muscle development, which show static H3K4me2 enrichment over the gene body and H3K4me3 enrichment towards the gene body during myogenic differentiation. This study reveals that MyoD significantly binds to this particular subset of genes and further systematic analysis shows the repressive role of MyoD. Interestingly, MyoD binds and down-regulates Patz1 which is important for maintaining pluripotency. These findings might provide a key regulatory mechanism to promote myogenic differentiation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq profile of of two different histone modifications (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and a transcription factor MyoD during C2C12 cells differentiation.
