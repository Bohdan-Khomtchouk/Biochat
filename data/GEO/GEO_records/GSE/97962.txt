TITLE
ZNF516 Is a Potent Suppressor of the EGFR Oncogene through Chromatin Targeting of the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST Complex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we report that ZNF516 functions as a transcription repressor. We showed that ZNF516 is physically associated with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST corepressor complex and transcriptionally represses the expression of a collection of genes including EGFR that are critically involved in cell proliferation and motility. We demonstrated that the ZNF516 inhibits the proliferation and invasive potential of breast cancer cells in vitro and suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. We explored the clinical significance of the ZNF516-CtBP/LSD1/CoREST-EGFR axis in breast carcinomas.

DESIGN
Target genes of ZNF516 in MCF-7 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
