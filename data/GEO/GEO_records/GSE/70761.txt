TITLE
SPINK1 promotes Colorectal Cancer progression by down regulating Metallothioneins expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling was performed using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. A total of 3 microarray hybridizations were performed using each stable shSPINK1 cell line samples against control shSCRM cells.

DESIGN
SPINK1 gene was knocked down using shRNA in WIDR cells in the experimental group and shScramble cells were used as control.
