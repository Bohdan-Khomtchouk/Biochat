TITLE
Dendritic cell-derived IL-2 promotes apoptosis of terminally mature cells via a novel autocrine signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for sensing pathogens and triggering immune response. GM-CSF myeloid dendritic cells (GM-DCs) secrete several cytokines including IL-2 upon activation by pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) ligands. DC IL-2 has been shown to be important for innate and adaptive immune responses, however its importance in DC physiology has never been demonstrated. This is due to ambiguity in expression of the CD122 subunit of the IL-2 trimeric receptor complex crucial for signaling. We show here that autocrine IL-2 signaling is functional in GM-DCs in early time window of stimulation with PAMPs. IL-2 signaling selectively activates the JAK/STAT5 pathway by assembling holo-receptor complexs at the cell surface. Autocrine IL-2 signaling inhibits survival of PAMP matured GM-DCs which is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Our findings suggest immune regulation by a novel autocrine signaling pathway that can potentially be exploited in DC immunotherapy. Microarray technology was used to understand the role of IL-2 signaling in DC.

DESIGN
Microarray was performed to investigate the role of IL-2 signaling in DC physiology. Hence Wt or IL-2-/- BMDCs were either treated or not with curdlan for 6h and taken for microarray.
