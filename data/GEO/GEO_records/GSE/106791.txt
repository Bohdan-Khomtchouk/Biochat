TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in multiple human cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines ( pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and bladder cancer) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (PANC-1, 786-O, A498, SAS, PC3 and T24) were treated with miRNAs (miR-455-3p, miR-455-5p, miR-451a, miR-144-3p, miR-144-5p, miR-135-5p, miR-135-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-184, miR-199-3p, miR-107, miR-185-5p, miR-320b and miR-320c), siRNAs (si-PHLDA2).
