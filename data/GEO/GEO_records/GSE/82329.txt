TITLE
Adaptation of the Kinome Promotes Resistance to BET Bromodomain Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small molecule BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) are actively being pursued in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of cancers, however, the mechanisms of resistance to targeted BET protein inhibitors remain poorly understood. Using a novel mass spectrometry approach that globally measures kinase signaling at the proteomic level, we evaluated the response of the kinome to targeted BET inhibitor treatment in a panel of BRD4-dependent ovarian carcinoma (OC) cell lines. Despite initial inhibitory effects of BETi, OC cells acquired resistance following sustained treatment with the BETi, JQ1. Through application of Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BETi resistance is mediated by adaptive kinome reprogramming, where activation of compensatory pro-survival kinase networks overcomes BET protein inhibition. Furthermore, drug combinations blocking these kinases may prevent or delay the development of drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of BET inhibitor therapy.

DESIGN
RNAseq was employed to identify changes in kinase RNA expression following short term (48h) or chronic (JQ1R) JQ1 treatment in three different ovarian cancer cell lines.
