TITLE
Directional RNA sequencing of mRNA from Sinorhizobium meliloti cells grown with limiting phosphate and with excess phosphate.

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Analysis of the RNA-seq reads confirmed that transcription of many of the previously identified Pho-regulon genes of Sinorhizobium meliloti was regulated by the availability of inorganic phosphate in the media.  The transcriptional start sites of many of the Pho-regulon genes as determined by RNA-seq reads were found to correspond to those determined from primer extension analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA from S. meliloti RmP110 grown in MOPS + 2 mM Pi and MOPS + 20 µM Pi – directional RNA-seq via Illumina sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16515 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Sinorhizobium meliloti)
