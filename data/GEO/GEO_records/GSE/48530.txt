TITLE
Comparative genomics of the srd1 null mutant Candida albicans strain CaLY202.

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
To investigate the diversity of gene contents of Candida albicans strain by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH; aCGH).

DESIGN
the srd1 null mutant Candida albicans strain CaLY202 was selected to carry out the comparative genomics microarray. Two-condition experiment, CaLY202 vs.SN152. Biological replicates: 2 control, 2 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9471 Candida albicans 27.6K genome array
