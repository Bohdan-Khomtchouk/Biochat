TITLE
Transcriptomic data of UCSF4 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their neural derivatives

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare transcriptomic profiles between UCSF4 hESCs and their neural derivatives, neural precursor cells (NPCs), we performed microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST array platform.

DESIGN
Six biological samples, three biological replicates for each developmental cell stage (in vitro)

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
