TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF Gene Expression During Infection

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
Changes in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF gene expression during infection in a rabbit model of subdermal abscess formation were studied using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Samples assayed in arrays consisted of the input inoculum and total RNA collected from the subdermal chambers at 2 and 8 hours post-inoculation.  Alexa647-labeled samples were co-hybridized with 0.5 micrograms of sheared OG1RF genomic DNA labeled with Cy3 as a standard reference between chips.  Four biological replicates were performed for each of the 3 time points.
