TITLE
Effect of dietary immunostimulation in head kidney and spleen of rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The effect of dietary immunostimulation in the immune organs, head kidney and spleen, of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), was investigated using a salmonid-specific microarray platform enriched with immune-related genes. Immunostimulant-diet feeding significantly changed transcriptomic expression profiles: larger reduction rather than induction was observed, with significant regulation in genes and functional GO categories related to remodeling processes and immune and hematopoietic activities. The results revealed that Immunostimulant-diets hava effect in the transcriptome of cultured fish. Keywords: spleen, head kidney, immunostimulats, transcriptomic response, trout
