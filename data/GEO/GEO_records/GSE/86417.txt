TITLE
RNA-seq of mouse embryonic stem cell states expressing Esrrb, Tbx3, and Zscan4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We develop a theoretical-computational framework for inferring cell state transition dynamics, and apply it to mouse embryonic stem cells states defined by expression levels of Esrrb, Tbx3, and Zscan4. RNA-seq was performed to characterize the larger transcriptional differences between states expressing combinations of these three specific genes, and proceed to explore their dynamic interconversion.

DESIGN
A double knock-in reporter for Esrrb and Tbx3 with distinct fluorescent proteins was constructed to enable purification of substates defined by their relative expression levels (Esrrb-/Tbx3-; Esrrb+/Tbx3-; Esrrb+/Tbx3+). A second line was constructed using a promoter-fragment reporter to isolate Zscan4+ from Zscan4- cells. Following FACS isolation, the subpopulations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Biological replicates were collected on different days.
