TITLE
Gene and retrotransposon expression analysis in the F1 hybrid background of B6 and MSM for WT, Pld6 KO, and Dnmt3l KO male germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA sequencing analysis of FACS-purified leptotene/zygotene (L/Z) spermatocytes

DESIGN
Compare transcriptomes of WT, Pld6 KO, and Dnmt3l KO germ cells in the F1 hybrid background of B6 and MSM to study these mutations affecting gene expression due to nearby retrotransposons.

PLATFORM
