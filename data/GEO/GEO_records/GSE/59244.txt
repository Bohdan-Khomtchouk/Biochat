TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for 5q- myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are uncommon entities, heterogeneous clinically and cytogenetically. Recently, a new drug, Lenalidomide, has demonstrated to be very effective in patients with MDS and 5q- reaching 70% of hematological responses whereas patients with MDS without 5q- has only 20-30% of hematological responses. The aim of the present study is to determine genetic alteration in this subset of patients, and describe candidate genes related with response or resistance to Lenalidomide.

DESIGN
The aim of the present study is to determine genetic alteration in this subset of patients, and describe candidate genes related with response or resistance to Lenalidomide. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix GenomeWide SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 2 patients with MDS an isolated 5q- by conventional cytogenetics. There are also 2 samples from separated CD3+  lymphocytes, which were used as references for copy number and LOH inference.
