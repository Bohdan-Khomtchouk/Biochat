TITLE
Expression data from human pancreatic tissue from healthy subjects and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CEL mutation carriers may have increased pancreatic cancer risk. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying pancreatic cancer progression in a CEL mutation carrier and non-CEL mutation pancreatic cancer patients + controls.

DESIGN
We selected pancreatic specimens from four normal pancreata and four pancreata with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) including a CEL mutation carrier
