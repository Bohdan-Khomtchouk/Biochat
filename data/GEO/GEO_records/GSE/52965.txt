TITLE
Differential Methylation Of The TRPA1 Promoter In Pain Sensitivity: MeDIP-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic pain is a global public health problem, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we examine genome-wide DNA methylation, first in 50 identical twins discordant for heat pain sensitivity and then in 50 further unrelated individuals. Whole blood DNA methylation was characterized at 5.2 million loci by MeDIP-sequencing and assessed longitudinally to identify differentially methylated regions associated with high or low pain-sensitivity (pain-DMRs). Nine meta-analysis pain-DMRs show robust evidence for association (false discovery rate 5%) with the strongest signal in the pain gene TRPA1 (P=1.2Ã—10-13). Several pain-DMRs show longitudinal stability consistent with susceptibility effects, have similar methylation levels in brain, and altered expression in skin. Our approach identifies epigenetic changes in both novel and established candidate genes that provide molecular insights into pain and may generalize to other complex traits.

DESIGN
MeDIP-sequencing in 100 individulas using a 2 stage design: paired-end MeDIP-seq in 50 monozygotic twins and single-end MeDIP-seq in 50 unrelated individuals.
