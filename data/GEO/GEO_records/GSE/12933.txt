TITLE
miRNA profiles of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of human Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines derived from the two main subtypes of this disease: Activated B Cell like (ABC-DLBCL) and Germinal Center B cell like  (GCB-DLBCL), analyzing the 711 human miRNAs present in miRBase V10.0. Five ABC-like DLBCL cell lines (RIVA, Oci-Ly3, Oci-Ly10, HBL1 and U2932) and three GCB-like DLBCL cell lines (Oci-Ly7, Oci-Ly19 and SUDHL-6) were cultured in IMDM (Cellgro) with 20% human plasma, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/L-glutamine (Cellgro,) and 0,2% beta mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion), and sent to LC Sciences facility for microarray hybridization using microfluidics technology. FirstChoice® Human Skeletal Muscle Total RNA (Ambion) was used as common reference for all hybridizations. Background substracted and normalized data from each channel was used to calculate log ratios sample/reference. Keywords: miRNA profiling
