TITLE
The whole transcriptome expression profiling comparison between the CtBP1 knockdown, CtBP2 knockdown and scramble control in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To discover the core gene expression features of CtBP1, CtBP2 differently regulated in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells. The compared the whole transcript expression profiling between CtBP1 knockdown, CtBP2 knockdown and scramble control in ovarian cancer skov3 cells.

DESIGN
The 2  scramble control clones, 3 CtBP1 knockdown clones and 2 CtBP2 knockdown  clones from ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells  were used to discover the key feature genes that CtBP1/CtBP2 differential regulated . The RNA was extracted from well cultured  cells  using TRIzol reagent, and whole transcriptome gene expression  profiling were performed using an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST microarray platform.
