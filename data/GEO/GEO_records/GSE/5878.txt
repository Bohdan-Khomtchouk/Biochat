TITLE
Lacrimal Gland Gene expression in Aromatase Knockout Mice and Wild Type Controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Effect of Aromatase Knockout on Gene Expression in the Mouse Lacrimal and Meibomoan Gland. Keywords: Aromatase Knockout vs Wild Type Control

DESIGN
Lacrimal and meibomian glands were harvested from homozygous male and female aromatase knockout mice and age matched wild type controls. Tissues were pooled into 3 biological replicates and were hybridized to separate microarrays.  Each cRNA prep was hybridized to a GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLink UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray and a Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Array 430A.

PLATFORM
GPL2894 GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLinkâ„¢   UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
