TITLE
Light activation of the sigmaB-mediated general stress-response of Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
The sigma(B)-dependent general stress response in the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be elicited by a range of stress factors, such as starvation or an ethanol-, salt-, or heat-shock, via a complex upstream signaling cascade. Additionally, sigma(B) can be activated by blue light, via the phototropin homologue YtvA, a component of the environmental branch of the signaling cascade. The genome-wide transcriptomes of B. subtilis reported here show that sigma(B) can activated by blue as well as red light via RsbP/RspQ, the energy branch of sigma(B) upstream signaling cascade.
