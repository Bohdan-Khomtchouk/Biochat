TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of Flk1Cre;ETV2 CKO mouse yolk sacs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes critical for vascular development, we generated mice where ETV2 is inactivated in FLK1+ cells by a loxP-Cre recombination approach.  Results provide a detailed insight into the function of ETV2 in emrbyonic vasculare formation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from E9.5 yolk sacs from Flk1Cre;ETV2 CKO and control mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
