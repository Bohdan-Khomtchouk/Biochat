TITLE
To examine the influence of the early stress of maternal separation on the hippocampal transcriptome in young adulthood

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined the consequences of the early stress (ES) of maternal separation on hippocampal gene expression in young adulthood. Young adult (2 months old) ES animals exhibit hippocampal transcriptome changes with a significant regulation of genes associated with intracellular signaling, MAP kinase signaling, plasma membrane function, neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors and cytoskeletal components.
