TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in mouse kidney tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the mouse left kidney and right kidney.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the three mouse left kidneys and three mouse right kidneys and identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs.
