TITLE
Transcript Profiling of Arcuate Nucleus in Response to Electroacupuncture on Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The electroacupuncture-induced analgesic effect has been used widely to alleviate diverse pains. However, significant individual variations in analgesic effect of EA for both experiments and clinics were reported. According to the sensitivity of the analgesic response to EA stimulation, the subjects could be categorized into high responders (HR) and non responders (NR). However, the molecular mechanism of individual variability in the analgesic response to acupuncture stimulation is still uncertain. This study aims to investigate the potential gene expression in arcuate nucleus induced by 2Hz/100Hz electroacupuncture in HR and NR rats. Rats were given 2Hz or 100Hz electroacupuncture for 30 min and using cDNA microarrays to compare different gene expression in arcuate nucleus.

DESIGN
Rats were exposed to different frequencies (2Hz or 100Hz) electroacupuncture stimulation for 30 min and nociceptive testing and returned to home cages for 1 hour before sacrificed. According to the sensitivity of the analgesic response to 2Hz or 100Hz EA stimulation, the rats divided into four groups: 2Hz-HR group, 2Hz-NR group, 100Hz-HR group and 100Hz-NR group. Subsequently analyzed their dorsal horn transcript profile using cDNA microarrays, the rats were without receiving electroacupuncture as control. The tissue of arcuate nucleus (Arc) of three rats was selected for transcript analysis in each group. The three control rats were mixed and labeled with cy5, each rat of experiment groups was labeled with cy3.
