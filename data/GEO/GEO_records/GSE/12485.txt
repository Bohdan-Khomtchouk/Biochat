TITLE
Changes in cardiac transcription profiles following off-pump coronary revascularization surgery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate changes in cardiac transcription profiles caused by off-pump cardiac surgery, we collected myocardial samples, prior and after grafting, from patients undergoing off-pump coronary revascularization surgery. The transcriptional profile of the mRNA in these samples was measured with gene array technology. Changes in transcriptional profiles can be correlated with the stress response of heart to off-pump surgery. Keywords: human, cardiac, OPCAB coronary surgery, gene expression.

DESIGN
Myocardial samples were collected, prior and after grafting, from patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
