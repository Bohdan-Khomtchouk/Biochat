TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis Reveals SR Protein Cooperation and Competition in Regulated Splicing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins (SRFS1 and SFRS2 using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts carrying tet-repressible versions of the two genes.

DESIGN
4 biological replicate sets of SFRS1 or SFRS2 tet-repressible MEFs were grown for 5 days -/+ docycline. Total RNA was isolated and labeled targets hybridized to Affymetrix mouse splicing arrays.  This is the gene expression component of the study only.

PLATFORM
