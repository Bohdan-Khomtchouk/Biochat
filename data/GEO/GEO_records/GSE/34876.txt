TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Human Upf1, SMG5, SMG7 and PNRC2 downregulated substrates in HeLa cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cellular NMD (Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) substrates that regulated by Upf1, SMG5, SMG7 and/or PNRC2 in HeLa cell. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that endogenous NMD substrates may co-regulated by Upf1, SMG5, SMG7 and PNRC2.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa cells with downregulation of Upf1, SMG5, PNRC2 or SMG7 by siRNA. The up- or down-regulated transcripts were compare to control siRNA treated HeLa cell RNA extract. Significant transcripts were confirmed by replication

PLATFORM
