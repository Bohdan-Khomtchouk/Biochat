TITLE
Short-term growth hormone treatment on the liver and muscle transcriptome in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Although studies have established that exogenous growth hormone (GH) treatment stimulates growth in fish, its effects on target tissue gene expression are not well characterized.  We assessed the effects PosilacÂ® (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO), a recombinant bovine somatotropin, on tissue transcript levels.  Transcript abundance was measure in liver and muscle using the GRASP 16 K cDNA microarray.  A selection of the genes identified as altered with the microarray, and also transcripts for insulin-like growth factors, growth hormone receptors (GHR) and myostatins were measured by realtime PCR in the liver, muscle, brain, kidney, intestine, stomach, gill and heart.  In general, transcripts identified as differentially regulated in the muscle on the microarray showed similar direction of expression in the other non-hepatic tissues.  Rainbow trout were selected from two high growth rate and two low growth rate families.  A total of 113 and 67 transcripts were identified by microarray as differentially expressed with GH treatment across growth rate for muscle and liver respectively.  The largest proportion of the transcripts represented novel transcripts, followed by immune and metabolism related genes.  The immune related genes were primarily modulated in the liver and indicate activation of a non-specific immune response.  The metabolic genes include lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and one carbon metabolism pathway transcripts.  Most notable among the growth axis genes measured by realtime PCR were increases in GHR1 and-2 transcript in liver and muscle.  Our results indicate that short-term GH treatment activates the immune system, shifts the metabolic sectors and modulates growth regulating genes.
