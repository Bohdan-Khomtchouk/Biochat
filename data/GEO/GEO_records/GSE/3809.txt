TITLE
Gene expression profiling of livers from cafestol-fed APOE3Leiden mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Unfiltered coffee markedly increases serum lipid levels in humans and mice. The responsible compounds are the fat-soluble diterpenes cafestol and kahweol. Cafestol is responsible for more than 80% of the effect on serum lipids and is the most potent cholesterol-elevating compound known in the human diet. Aim of these microarray studies was to identify novel genes and regulatory pathways determining the cholesterol raising effect of cafestol by genome-wide expression studies.

DESIGN
Transgenic APOE3Leiden (E3L) mice of the N21th generation ( > 99% C57BL6/JIco) were used. Mice were 10 weeks of age at the start of experiments, and received control or cafestol diet for 4 weeks (n=7 and 8 respectively). As control diet, diet W (Hope Farms) was used, a semi-synthetic diet (18.2 MJ/kg) enriched with saturated fat (15g/100g) and cholesterol (0.25g/100g). This diet was supplemented with 0.04% (wt/wt) cafestol and 0.02% (wt/wt) kahweol for the cafestol diet. Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate: the same RNAs were labeled, divided into two different pools and hybridized onto two different GEMs 2.03 (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). Duplicates are indicated by the same SY or TP number in the sample titles.
