TITLE
The SHR/SCR pathway directly activates genes involved in asymmetric cell division in the Arabidopsis root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Asymmetric division of cortex/endodermal initials (CEI) in the Arabidopsis root generates two layers of ground tissue and is controlled by a finely orchestrated interplay between the transcription factors, SHORT ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR).  To understand the dynamics of the SHR/SCR regulatory network we performed microarray time course experiments using inducible versions of SHR and SCR and examined their transcriptional effects specifically in the ground tissue. Keywords: SHR and SCR time course and CEI cell-type analyses

DESIGN
We performed a time course analysis (TC data set) of the ground tissue (sorted J0571 enancher trap) after transfer either SHR or SCR inducible plants to Dex containing plates 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours. We sorted for CEI cells using the pCYCD6::GFP marker line.  Seedlings were grown for 5 days. SHR and SCR inducible plants were transfer to 1microM Dex MS plates. J0571 and CYCD6 sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.
