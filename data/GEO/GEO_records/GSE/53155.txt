TITLE
Human osteosarcoma cells respond to sorafenib chemotherapy by downregulation of the tumor progression factors S100A4, CXCR4 and the oncogene FOS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is a rare but aggressive bone neoplasm in humans, which is commonly treated with surgery, classical chemotherapy and radiation. Here, we studied the antimetastatic potential of 4 μM of the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib in a human osteosarcoma cell line using DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
3 untreated replicates of human osteosarcoma cells (ATCC CRL-1543™), 3 replicates of human osteosarcoma cells (ATCC CRL-1543™) treated with 4 µM Sorafenib
