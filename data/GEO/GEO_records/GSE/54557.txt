TITLE
Transcription profiling of liver from farnesoid X receptor knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of whole body (WB) FXR knockout (KO) mice (FXR WB KO), liver-specific FXR KO mice (AFXR Cre+) and enterocyte specific FXR KO mice (VFXR Cre+) on a C57BL/6J genetic background

DESIGN
Whole body (WB) FXR knockout (KO) mice (FXR WB KO), liver-specific FXR KO mice (AFXR Cre+) and enterocyte specific FXR KO mice (VFXR Cre+) on a C57BL/6J genetic background were bred and maintained in the laboratory animal research facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center in rooms under a 12-hour light-dark cycle.  All experiments used 10-16 week-old male mice.  FXR was activated by treatment with the FXR synthetic agonist, GW4064, at 150 mg/kg. GW4064 or vehicle was administered by oral gavage at 6 p.m., followed by a second administration at 8 a.m. the next morning.  Two hours later, the liver was harvested.
