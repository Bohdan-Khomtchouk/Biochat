TITLE
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in the ApoE Knockout Mouse: Time Course of Control vs. Angiotensin II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of suprarenal aorta from ApoE-/- mice  (12-14 weeks old, C57BL/6J background)  treated by subcutaneous pump with angiotensin II or saline for 7d, 14d and 28d. Includes Ang II-treated samples at 7d found to have dissected aneurysms. Goal was to examine gene expression in developing AAA in this model over time.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, one suprarenal aorta per array. Saline vs. angiotensin II at 3 time points, with inclusion of 3 Ang II-treated dissected. Total 35 arrays: 6 saline 7d, 6 saline 14d, 5 saline 28d, 4 Ang II 7d, 5 Ang II 14d, 6 Ang II 28d, 3 Ang II-dissected 7d.
