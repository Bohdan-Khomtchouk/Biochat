TITLE
genome-wide measurement of mRNA lifetime in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We measured the mRNA abundance in E.coli using RNAseq to calculate mRNA lifetimes. The data is used in support of a larger paper on the proteome and transcriptome of E.coli.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA abundance over time, after the addition of transcription inhibitor, rifampicin. Center: Harvard University

PLATFORM
GPL10328 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Escherichia coli)
