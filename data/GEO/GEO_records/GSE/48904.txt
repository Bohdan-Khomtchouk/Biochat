TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation maps during dehydration in leaf tissues of Boea hygrometrica

ORGANISM
Dorcoceras hygrometricum

SUMMARY
To examine the Boea hygrometrica genome methylation landscape and assess its functional significance during dehydration, we generated the first single-base resolution genome methylation maps for leaf tissues of hydrated, dehydrating to 70% RWC and dehydrating to 10% RWC (desiccating). The overall density of methyl-cytosine was not broadly altered by dehydration. There is, however, a small increase in intensity both for the whole genome and regionally during the first dehydration step (70% RWC) returning to near hydrated levels as leaves desiccate. We identified 5575 differentially methylated region-related genes during dehydration. The finding may provide an important clue for exploring molecular mechanisms and the regulation of desiccation tolerance at the whole-genome level.

DESIGN
