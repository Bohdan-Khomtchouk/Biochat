TITLE
Gene expression data on lungs of wild-type and Rora (Retinoic acid related orphan receptor) mutant mice exposed to room air and smoke

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data on wild-type and Rora mutant mice exposed to room air and smoke. The results provide a general insight into the relationship of Rora to known DNA damage response pathways and its role in cigarette smoke-induced airspace enlargement.
