TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ElonginA knocked-down Hela cells in the presence of Doxorubicin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional elongation factor Elongin A exhibits an activity to repress the temporary pause of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) on the DNA template, resulting in increase of mRNA synthesis in vitro. However, actual elongation ability of Elongin A in mammalian cells has not been determined yet. To elucidate the practical transcriptional role of mammalian Elongin A in vivo, we carried out whole genome expression analysis using Elongin A knocked-down HeLa cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in Elongin A knocked-down HeLa cells was measured at 2 hours after doxorubicin treatment (1microM).
