TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of A. thaliana expressing auxin degradation resistant IAA26-P108H-GFP from the IAA26 native promoter

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of seven-week-old auxin resistant pIAA26::IAA26-P108H-GFP transgenic plants to non-transformed control plants to identify candidate genes and pathways regulated by IAA26.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was performed with A. thaliana ecotype Shahdara seven-week-old leaves from auxin resistant pIAA26::IAA26-P108H-GFP transgenic plants or non-transformed controls.  Four fully expanded leaves were collected from each test plant and total RNA from four to six individual test plants was pooled for each of the three biological replicates.  Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform using rapid run mode with 50 nt single end reads.
