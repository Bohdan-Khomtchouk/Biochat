TITLE
Expression profiles of (40,XX) and (39,XO) females

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gobal expression analysis in four somatic tissues (brain, liver, kidney and muscle) of adult 40,XX and 39,XO mice with the aim of identifying which genes are expressed from both X chromosomes as well as those genes deregulated in X chromosome monosomy. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
For each tissue, the RNA samples of seven 40,XX, eight 39,XpO and eight 39,XmO mice were pooled by genotype into 9 groups, representing 3 biological replicates per genotype, as follows: 39,XpO-1 and 39,XpO-2 (3 pooled individuals each), 39,XpO-3 (2 pooled individuals); 39,XmO-1 and 39,XmO-2 (3 pooled individuals each), 39,XmO-3 (2 pooled individuals); 40,XX-1 and 40,XX-2 (3 pooled individuals each) 40,XX-3 (2 pooled individuals)
