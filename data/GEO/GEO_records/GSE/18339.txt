TITLE
citrate vs nitrate Reducing cultures

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
The effect of nitrate reduction (anaerobic cultivation in the presence of heme, vitamin K2 and nitrate) was compared with anaerobic cultivation supplemented with citrate (Lactobacillus plantarum). The medium was chemically defined medium with mannitol as main carbon source

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, nitrate vs citrate reducing cells. Biological replicates: 4 nitrate reducing cultures, 4 citrate reducing cultures, independently grown and harvested. Two slides were used, each slide contained 8 Arrays. Citrate reducing cultures are called reactor 1-4, Nitrate reducing cultures are called reactor A-D

PLATFORM
GPL5874 WCFS Lactobacillus plantarum 15K 60-mer array, Version 3, our ID LPAG3_8
