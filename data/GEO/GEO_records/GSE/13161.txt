TITLE
A transcriptome atlas of rice cell types uncovers cellular, functional and developmental hierarchies

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Whole-genome transcriptional profiles of rice cell types, isolated by laser-capture microdissection. The first comprehensive multi-organ cell type transcriptome atlas from a plant, with 40 distinct cell types from several developmental stages of seeds, shoots and roots, reveals cell-specific promoter motifs, interaction partner candidates, hormone response centers, and other previously unrecognized cellular properties and patterns. Keywords: Cell type comparison
