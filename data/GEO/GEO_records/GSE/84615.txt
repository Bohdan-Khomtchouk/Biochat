TITLE
Tissue-specific Emergence of Regulatory and Intraepithelial T Cells from a Clonal T-cell Precursor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA sequencing to characterize gene expression of CD4+ CD8α+ double positive (DP), Foxp3+ Treg (TR) and CD4+ single positive (SP) cells in the lamina propria (LP) and intraepithelial compartment (IEL) that had differentiante from the same clonal transnuclear (TN) precursor.

DESIGN
We adoptively transferred CD4+ CD8α- Foxp3-GFP- isolated from pTregTN/RKO/Foxp3-GFP mice into TCRαβKO hosts. After 6 weeks, we sorted transferred CD4+ CD8α+, Foxp3+ pTreg as well as unconverted CD4+ CD8α- Foxp3-GFP- from the small intestine LP and IEL compartments for whole transcriptome analysis by mRNA sequencing.
