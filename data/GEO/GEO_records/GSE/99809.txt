TITLE
Expression data from WT liver DX5- NK cells and dnTGFbRII liver DX5- NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus

SUMMARY
Liver is a unique immunological organ containing large number of NK cells which play an important role in the maintenance of liver homeostasis, especially the specific liver resident DX5- NK cell subset. We used microarrays to detail the differences of normal DX5- NK cells and the DX5- NK cells in inflammatory environment.

DESIGN
WT and dnTGFbRII mice liver DX5- NK cells were sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We wanted to analysis the changes of liver resident NK cells in inflammatory environment.
