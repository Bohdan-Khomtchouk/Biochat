TITLE
Mammary Tissue: Wild type mammary glands vs IGF-IR induced mammary tumors vs IGF-IR independent tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Molecular profiling was used to classify mammary tumors that develop in MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice. It was determined that the primary mammary tumors (PMT), which develop due to elevated expression of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in mammary epithelial cells, most closely resemble murine tumors with basal-like or mixed gene expression profiles and with human basal-like breast cancers. Downregulation of IGF-IR transgene in MTB-IGFIR tumor-bearing mice leads to the regression of most of the tumors followed by tumor re-appearance in some of the mice. These tumors that re-appear following IGF-IR transgene downregulation do not express the IGF-IR transgene and cluster with murine mammary tumors that express a mesenchymal gene expression profile and with human claudin-low breast cancers. Therefore, IGF-IR overexpression in murine mammary epithelial cells induces mammary tumors with primarily basal-like characteristics while tumors that develop following IGF-IR downregulation express a gene signature that most closely resembles human claudin-low breast tumors.

DESIGN
Three conditions: 8 wild type (WT) mammary glands, 11 primary mammary tumor (PMT) samples, 9 recurrent spindle tumor (RST) samples, each sample was hybridized against a universal mouse reference RNA
