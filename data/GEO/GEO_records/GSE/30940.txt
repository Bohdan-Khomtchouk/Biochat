TITLE
Evaluating the transcriptomic and metabolic profile of mice exposed to source drinking water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic and metabonomic methods were used to investigate miceâ€™s responses to drinking source water (DSW) exposure. After mice were fed with DSW for 90 days, hepatic transcriptome was characterized by microarray and serum metabonome were determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A total of 243 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 141 genes were up-regulated and 102 genes were down-regulated. Metabonomics revealed significant changes in concentrations of creatine, pyruvate, glutamine, lysine, choline, acetate, lipids, taurine and trimethylamine oxide. Four biological pathways were identified by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis where both gene expression and metabolite concentrations were altered in response to DSW exposure. These results highlight the significance of combined use of transcriptomic and metabonomic approaches in evaluating potential health risk induced by DSW contaminated with various hazardous materials.

DESIGN
Nine mice in each group were selected and the livers of every three mice were homogenized together to obtain a total RNA sample. Three RNA samples in the treated or control group were hybridized separately onto three arrays to compare the genomic expression between the two groups.
