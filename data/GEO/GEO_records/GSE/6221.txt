TITLE
Characterization of anaerobic catabolism of p-coumarate in Rhodopseudomonas palustris

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris

SUMMARY
To address the question of how photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris metabolize lignin derived compound p-coumarate, transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics were combined to characterize gene expression profiles at both the mRNA level and protein level in Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown with succinate, benzoate, and p-coumarate as the carbon source. Keywords: Comparison of transcriptome profiles

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles among Rhodopseudomonas palustris cells grown with succinate, benzoate, and p-coumarate as the carbon source were compared.
