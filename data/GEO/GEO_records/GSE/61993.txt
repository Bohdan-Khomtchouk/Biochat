TITLE
Expression data from human keratinocytes stimulated with streptococcal M1 protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to investigate if keratinocytes excert an immuno-inflammatory response towards streptococcal M1 protein. Keratinocytes respond to M1 protein by activating pathways to induce the production of inflammatory signaltransducers, AP-1 and NFkB transcription factor subunits, together with inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, CCL20 and IL-1 family proteins etc.

DESIGN
HaCaT cells were cultured in serum-free media, without calcium, until 80% confluency. Cells were incubated 6 h in absence or presence of M1 protein before RNA extraction. The integrity of RNA quality was analysed by an Bioanalyzer. Out of 12 samples, 3 M1 stimulated and 3 control samples were chosen for hybridization on Affymetrix Human 2.0 ST array.
