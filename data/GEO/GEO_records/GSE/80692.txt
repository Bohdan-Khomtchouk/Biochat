TITLE
Circadian gene expression profile of pancreatic islets from C57BL6 mice fed on rodent chow diet collected at 4hr intervals around the clock

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of pancreatic islet transcriptome at 4hr intervals around the clock helps to identify genes that are cycling under the control of the circadian clock. We used Agilent microarrays to analyze pancreatic islet transcriptome at different time points across the circadian cycle.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islets were isloated at ZT0, ZT4, ZT8, ZT12, ZT16, and ZT20 (ZT0 corresponds to lights on - 06:00hr and ZT12 corresponds to lights off - 18:00hr in a 12hr light, 12hr dark cycle). Pooled RNA samples, 3-5 mice per group, were used for the array.
