TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of K3K27ac, H2AZ and methylation data in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated two types 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) data in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq).

DESIGN
Examination of 2 histone modifications and methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus) GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
