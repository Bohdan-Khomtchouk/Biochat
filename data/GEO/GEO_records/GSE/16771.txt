TITLE
Male Fundulus exposed to 1,720ppb arsenic, and their parentally exposed offspring

ORGANISM
Fundulus heteroclitus

SUMMARY
The present study investigated arsenicâ€™s effects on mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus), while also examining what role that gender or age of exposure might play.  Adult male and female mummichogs were exposed to 172ppb, 575ppb, or 1,720ppb arsenic as sodium arsenite for 10 days immediately prior to spawning.  No differences were noted in the number or viability of eggs between the groups, but there was a significant increase in deformities in the 1,720ppb arsenic exposure group.  Total RNA from adult livers or 6-week-old juveniles was used to probe custom macroarrays for changes in gene expression.  In females, 3% of the genes were commonly differentially expressed in the 172 and 575ppb exposure groups.  In the males, between 1.1-3% of the differentially expressed genes were in common between the exposure groups.  Several genes, including apolipoprotein, serum amyloid precursor, lysozyme, and tributyltin-binding protein, were commonly expressed in either a dose-responsive or dose-specific, but across genders, manner.  These patterns of regulation were confirmed by QPCR.   These findings will provide us with a better understanding of the effects of dose, gender, and exposure age on the response to arsenic.
