TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Populus leaves with altered SA levels

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Salicylic acid (SA) has long been implicated in plant responses to oxidative stress.  A direct assessment of SA effects in planta has been difficult, as SA-overproducing Arabidopsis mutants are compromised in growth or other developmental processes.  We now report that transgenic Populus expressing a bacterial bifunctional SA synthase accumulated two to three orders of magnitude more total SA than wild type without affecting growth.  Microarray experiments were performed to gauge the transcriptional responses of young source leaves to SA manipulation and/or heat stress.  Differentially expressed genes due to SA perturbation or temperature treatment were identified. Co-expression network analysis was performed to identify key driver genes in SA-modulated response.
