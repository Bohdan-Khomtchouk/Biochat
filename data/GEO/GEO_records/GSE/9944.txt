TITLE
Gene expression data on human optic nerve head astrocytes in Caucasian and African americans with or without glaucoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether optic nerve head astrocytes, a key cellular component of glaucomatous neuropathy, exhibit differential gene expression in primary culture of astrocytes from African American donors with or without glaucoma, compared to astrocytes from Caucasian American donors with or without glaucoma. Keywords: Gene expression profile

DESIGN
We divided samples into four group: Caucasian American normal, Caucasian American with glaucoma, African American normal and African American with glaucoma. We analyzed data from Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 and U95 chips.
