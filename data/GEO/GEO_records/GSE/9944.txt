TITLE
Gene expression data on human optic nerve head astrocytes in Caucasian and African americans with or without glaucoma

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
To determine whether optic nerve head astrocytes, a key cellular component of glaucomatous neuropathy, exhibit differential gene expression in primary culture of astrocytes from African American donors with or without glaucoma, compared to astrocytes from Caucasian American donors with or without glaucoma. Keywords: Gene expression profile
