TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of OECM1 after expression of let-7i

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of let-7i results in transcriptome alteractions in head and neck cancer cell line, OECM1.

DESIGN
Stable transfection of pmCherry-let7i in OECM1 cell and analyzed the transcriptome by cDNA microarray. OECM1 transfected with pmCherry empty vector was used as a control of experiment.
