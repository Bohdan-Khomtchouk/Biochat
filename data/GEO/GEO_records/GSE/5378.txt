TITLE
Comparative Genome Analysis of Ureaplasma parvum Clinical Isolates

ORGANISM
Ureaplasma parvum

SUMMARY
Ureaplasma are widespread parasites colonizing the mucosal surface of the human urogenital tract, and it has been suspected as a causative agent of nongonococcal urethritis, pregnancy complications and prenatal infections. Ureaplasma may also cause central nervous system infections and affect the lower respiratory tract of newborn babies. However, Ureaplasma spp. have also been detected in the urogenital tracts of clinically healthy patients, and their role in the development of infections thus remains unclear. Like in other organisms, virulence of Ureaplasma is determined by the presence of virulence factors - adhesions, human IgA protease, phospholipase and urease. However, the existence of interrelationships between the presence of these genes in the Ureaplasma genome and the incidence of diseases in man has not been demonstrated. Difficulties in the elucidation of these interrelationships may arise from significant macro- (gene mutation, chromosomal rearrangements) and micro- (nucleotide polymorphism) genomic heterogeneity. It is possible that the combination of the variable strain-specific genes in Ureaplasma with generally known virulence factors determine the development of pathological processes on the mucosal surface of the human urogenital tract. Keywords: macroarray, variability of genome, Ureaplasma parvum
