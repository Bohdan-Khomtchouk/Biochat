TITLE
Influence of dietary fatty acid composition on white adipose tissue gene expression in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a randomized controlled dietary intervention study, we compared a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a diet enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFA) for influence on abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression. We studied young lean adults; 11 women and 25 men. There was no significant difference in age, BMI, or gene expression between the PUFA and SFA groups before the intervention. The intervention lasted for seven weeks. We calculated for each gene the absolute difference in gene expression after vs. before intervention (deltas), and compared the deltas between the PUFA and SFA group using SAM. 12 genes were significantly differentially regulated by the two diets with a FDR of 25%. These include metabolic and adipokine genes. In conclusion, dietary fatty acids have a modest influence on white adipose tissue gene expression.

DESIGN
Abdominal subcutaneous adipose needle biopsies were obtained from young adults before (W0) and after completion (W7) of the dietary intervention. From the biopsies we extracted RNA. From total RNA we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and then washed, stained and scanned the slides using standardised protocols (Affymetrix, Inc.). Signicance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was use to compare the difference in gene expression between groups.
