TITLE
RNA-sequencing of brain ECs isolated at P8 from mice with EC-specific deletion of YAP/TAZ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Hippo-YAP signaling in angiogenesis, we performed RNA-sequencing by using brain ECs isolated from mice with EC-specific deletion of indicated components of Hippo pathway.

DESIGN
Bung ECs were isolated from mice with indicated genotype at P8 and mRNA profiles was generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplicate, using Illumina NextSeq 500.
