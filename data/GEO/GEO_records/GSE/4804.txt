TITLE
IL-13 and EGF receptor signaling in normal human bronchial epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of interleukin-13 (IL-13) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway in controlling mucus metaplasia, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured on air-liquid interface for 14 days and were treated with IL-13, anti-EGFR antibody or both during the final 48 h of culture. Keywords: Stimulus response

DESIGN
There were 3 independent samples for each of 3 treatment groups (IL-13 only, anti-EGFR only, IL-13 plus anti-EGFR). Each of these sample was hybridized to one of the 3 independent control samples on a separate array.
