TITLE
IL-13 and EGF receptor signaling in normal human bronchial epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of interleukin-13 (IL-13) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway in controlling mucus metaplasia, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured on air-liquid interface for 14 days and were treated with IL-13, anti-EGFR antibody or both during the final 48 h of culture.
