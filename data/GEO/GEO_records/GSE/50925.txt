TITLE
Genomic localization of Cockayne syndrom B protein upon genotoxic stresses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cockayne syndrome is an inherited premature aging syndrome associated with developmental and neurological disorders.  Mutations in the genomic locus encoding CSB are associated with 80% Cockayne syndrome cases.  CSB is invovled in relieving UV-induced and oxidative stree. To gain more insights into the fucntion of CSB under these stress, we  use ChIP-seq to determine the genomic localization of CSB 1 hour after UV irradiation and menadione treatment.

DESIGN
Genomic localization of CSB and remodeling deficient CSBâˆ†N1

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
