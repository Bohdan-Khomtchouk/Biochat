TITLE
Effects of the nutritional background and parasite infection on the intestine transcriptome of gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Gilthead sea bream fed plant-protein based diets with either fish oil or vegetable oil as the most iportant source of dietary lipids were experimentally exposed to the intestinal parasite Enteromyxum leei by water effluent. A specific gilthead sea bream oligo-microarray was used to determine the intestine transcriptomic response.

DESIGN
41 samples from six experimental groups (2 diets x 3 infective status) in a single-color hybridization
