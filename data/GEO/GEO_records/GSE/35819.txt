TITLE
Comparison of hypoxia (4 % O2) cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to normoxia (21 % O2) cultured

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome at gene expression level in hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The transcriptome of cells cultured at three different timepoints, 2h, 24 h and 7 days with three different cell lines in normoxia and hypoxia was compared

DESIGN
18 samples total, 3 replicates in each conditions, 2h, 24 h and 7day timepoints in hypoxia and normoxia
