TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of PER2  on BMAL1 DNA binding and transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use PER2-inducible system to analyse BMAL1 chromatin binding by ChIPseq and expression profile by mRNA-Seq. PER2 decrease BMAL1 chromatin bindging but the effect on transcrtipion is gene-specific.

DESIGN
Comapration of BMAL1 ChIP-Seq and mRNA-seq between cells with PER2 and without PER2 induction
