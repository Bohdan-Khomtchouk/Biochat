TITLE
Copy number variants in candidate genes are genetic modifiers of Hirschsprung disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by absence of intramural ganglion cells along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. The HSCR phenotype is highly variable with respect to gender, segment length of aganglionosis, familiality and the presence of additional anomalies. By molecular genetic analysis, a minimum of 11 neuro-developmental genes (RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZFHX1B, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4) are known to harbor rare high-penetrance mutations that confer a large risk to the bearer. In addition, two other genes (RET, NRG1) harbor common low-penetrance polymorphisms that contribute only partially to risk and act as genetic modifiers. To broaden this search, we examined whether a set of 67 proven and candidate HSCR genes harbored additional modifier alleles. In this pilot study, we utilized a custom-designed array CGH with ~33,000 test probes at an average resolution of ~185bp to detect gene-sized or smaller copy number variants (CNVs) within these 67 genes in 18 heterogeneous HSCR patients. Using stringent criteria, we identified CNVs at three loci (MAPK10, ZFHX1B, SOX2) that are novel, involve regulatory and coding sequences of these neuro-developmental genes and show association with HSCR in combination with other congenital anomalies.
