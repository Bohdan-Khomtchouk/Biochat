TITLE
PFOS and PFHxS decrease lipoprotein production

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effect of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates on lipoprotein metabolism was investigated in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice with a humanized lipoprotein profile. Perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorooctane sulfonate markedly reduced both plasma TG and TC by decreasing nonHDL-C and HDL-C accompanied by a reduction in apoAI. Mechanistic studies showed that these effects were mainly caused by impaired lipoprotein production.

DESIGN
Male E3L.CETP mice on a C57Bl/6 background were fed a Western-type diet, containing 0.25% (w/w) cholesterol, 1% (w/w) corn oil and 14% (w/w) bovine fat (Western-type diet) (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) for 4 to 6 weeks in three independent experiments. Upon randomization according to total plasma cholesterol (TC) and TG levels, mice received the Western-type diet without or with PFBS (30 mg/kg/day), PFHxS (6 mg/kg/day) or PFOS (3 mg/kg/day) during 4-6 weeks. The effects of these PFAS on plasma lipids and lipoproteins were determined. In addition, PFAS levels were determined in plasma and livers were isolated for hepatic lipid analysis and hepatic gene expression analysis using an Affymetrix technology platform and Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays.
