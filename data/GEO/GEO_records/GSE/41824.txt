TITLE
Methylation profiling of Glioma Stem Cell lines vs GBM FFPE tissue biopsies and foetal Neural Stem Cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA methylation profiles of Glioma Stem Cell (GSC) lines were investigated in order to find the stem cell signature associated to glioblastoma (GBM). This goal was achieved through the comparison of GSC methylation data with FFPE-GBM biopsies and human foetal Neural Stem Cell (NSC) lines profiles.

DESIGN
GSC lines: 3 (GBM2, G144, G166). FFPE-GBM biopsy pool: FFPE-GBM pool: 1 pool from 5 GBM biopsies. Human foetal NSC lines: 2 (CB660 from forebrain; CB660SP form spinal cord). Methylated DNA from each sample was enriched with the immunoprecipitation method using 5-methylcytosine antibody (Eurogentec). Immunoprecipitated DNA (IP-DNA) and total DNA were labeled and hybridized on Agilent Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K. IP-DNA were labeled with Cy5 while the matching total DNA were labeled with Cy3.
