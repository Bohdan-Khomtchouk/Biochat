TITLE
Altered global gene profile in KSHV-infected siHa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common HIV/AIDS-associated tumor worldwide. Transmission routes of KSHV in the general population are poorly understood. Whereas sexual transmission appears to be common in homosexual men, the evidence for heterosexual transmission is less convincing. In fact, KSHVDNA sequences have been detected in the prostate, semen, and in the female genital tract. Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major risk factor and is a requirement for the development of cervical cancer. However, it remains unknown the interaction between KSHV and HPV, and the contribution of KSHV to cervical cancer development and pathogenesis.  In the present study, we used Illumina microarray to detect the global gene profile altered in KSHV-infected siHa cervical cancer cell-line containing integrated HPV16 genome.

DESIGN
SiHa cells were infected by KSHV and the gene expression signature was compared to the corresponding mock cells
