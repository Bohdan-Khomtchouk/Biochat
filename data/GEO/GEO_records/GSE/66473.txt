TITLE
Expression data from Keap1 overexpression and Nrf2 knockdown lung cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Keap1 overexpressed and Nrf2 depleted CL1-5 cells were used to identify genes regulated by Keap1/Nrf2 axis-dependent gene regulations We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying metastasis and identified distinct classes of Keap1/Nrf2-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
CL1-5 cells stably expressed Keap1 expressing construct and Nrf2-specific shRNA were analyzed compared to control cells
