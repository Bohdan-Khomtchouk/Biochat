TITLE
Expression data of GMDCs with conditioned medium from topotecan-treated E0771 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from damaged or dying cells not only elicit inflammation but also potentiate antitumor immune responses. Here, we show that treatment of breast cancer cells with the antitumor agent Topotecan, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, induces DAMP secretion that triggers dendritic cell activation and cytokine production.

DESIGN
To investigate the gene expression of GMDC that were cultured with the conditioned medium from topotecan-treated cells
