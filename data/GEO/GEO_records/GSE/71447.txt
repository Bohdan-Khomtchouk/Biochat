TITLE
Cell cycle-dependent resolution of DNA double-strand breaks repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Damage to genomic DNA, especially as DNA double strand breaks (DSB), elicits prompt activation of DNA damage response (DDR) which arrest cell-cycle either G1/S or G2/M to avoid entering S and M phase with DNA damage. In mammalian organs cells are in both proliferating and quiescent states. Quiescent cells are already arrested in G0, therefore there may be fundamental difference in DDR between proliferating and quiescent cells. To address these differences we studied recruitment of DSB repair factors and resolution of DNA lesions induced at site-specific DSBs occurring at different cell cycle phases, i.e. in asynchronously proliferating, G0, and G1 arrested cells. Strikingly, DSBs occurring in G0 quiescent cells are irreparable with a sustained activation of p53-pathway. Conversely, reentry of G0-damaged cells into cell cycle progression, show a delayed clearance of recruited DNA repair factors bound at DSBs, indicating an inefficient repair when compared to DSBs induced in asynchronously proliferating or G1 cells. Moreover, we found that initial recognition of DSBs and assembly of DSB factors is largely similar at different cell cycle phases. Our study thereby demonstrates the crucial role of cell cycle phases in repair and resolution of DSBs.
