TITLE
MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-conditioned medium (CM) was previously reported to affect the biology of tumor cells; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that MSCs secreted 40- to 100-nm particles, which have the typical characteristics of exosomes, and these MSC-derived exosomes promoted migration of the breast cancer cell line MCF7. To further investigate the effect of MSC-exosomes on MCF7, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of MCF7 treated with or without MSC-exosomes for 24 h.

DESIGN
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in breast cancer cell line MCF7 which were treated with or without mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes. This study uses total RNA recovered from two samples. One sample is MCF7 treated with PBS for 24 hours and another one is MCF7 treated with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for 24hours. The ultimate concentration of  mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes used in this experiment was 400ng/ul.
