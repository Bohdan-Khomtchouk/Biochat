TITLE
Deep sequencing reveals mRNA recruitment in translation initiation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We studied the initiation signals located in the translational initiation region (TIR) and identified the role for recognition of the initiation signals in each individual stage during formation of the initiation complexes.

DESIGN
Sequencing the randomized mRNA libraries captured by translation initiation complexes

PLATFORM
GPL14548 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Escherichia coli)
