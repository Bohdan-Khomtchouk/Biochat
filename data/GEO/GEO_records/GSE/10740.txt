TITLE
Expression data from  the colon of wild-type and Slc9a3 (NHE3)-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) provides a major route for intestinal Na+ absorption. It has been considered as a target of proinflammatory cytokines and enteropathogenic bacteria and impaired NHE3 expression and/or activity may be responsible for inflammation-associated diarrhea. We used microarray analysis to detail the global programme of colonic gene expression in the absence of functional NHE3. Keywords: knockout effect

DESIGN
Whole colon was dissected from 6-8 week old NHE3-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates and total RNA isolated for microarray analysis using Affymetrix murine MOE430 2.0 arrays
