TITLE
Pluripotency Factors Regulate Definitive Endoderm Specification through Eomesodermin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling early cell fate decisions in mammals is a major objective towards the development of robust methods for the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant cell types. Here, we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to study specification of definitive endoderm in vitro. Using a combination of whole genome expression and ChIP-seq analyses, we established a hierarchy of transcription factors regulating endoderm specification. Importantly, pluripotency factors, namely NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 have an essential function in this network by actively directing differentiation. Indeed, these transcription factors control the expression of EOMES, which marks the onset of endoderm specification. In turn, EOMES interacts with SMAD2/3 to initiate the transcriptional network governing endoderm formation. Together, these results provide for the first time a comprehensive molecular model connecting the transition from pluripotency to endoderm specification during mammalian development.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of Eomesodermin binding in human embyonic stem cells, differentiated towards an endodermal fate for 48h in chemically-defined culture media. Includes an input DNA control. Supplementary file GSE26097_README.txt contains descriptions of the raw data files and processed data files.
