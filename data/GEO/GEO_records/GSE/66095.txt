TITLE
Identification the target genes of microRNA in Ammopiptanthus mongolicus

ORGANISM
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus

SUMMARY
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus is an ecologically important desert plant. miRNA are endogenous 20-22 nt small RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression in plants. To identify to the target genes of miRNA in Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, degradome sequencing was performed and a batch of transcripts were found to be targeted by miRNA. The result is helpful in understanding the roles on miRNA in plant development and environmental stress response.

DESIGN
A degradome sequencing library was constructed using pooled mRNA isolated from leaves and roots of A. mongolicus seedlings. The library was sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
