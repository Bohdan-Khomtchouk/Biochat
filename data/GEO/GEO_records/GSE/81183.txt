TITLE
Genome-wide copy number analyses reveal genomic abnormalities involved in transformation of follicular lymphoma [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied 277 lymphoma samples (198 FL and 79 transformed FL [tFL]) using a single-nucleotide polymorphism array to identify the secondary chromosomal abnormalities that drive the development of FL and its transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This dataset is corresponding Gene expression data that is available for a subset of the tFL cases for Series GSE67385.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor biopsies were obtained from transformed Follicular Lymphoma cases. Total RNA was extracted and processed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol and hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2 arrays.
