TITLE
Effects of dominant-negative Smarca4 mutations on the DNA accessibility landscape [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a library of Smarca4 variants with mutations in conserved regions of the N-terminal ATPase domain based on mutants observed in primary tumors and cancer cell lines. Heterozygous expression of Smarca4 ATPase mutants led to decreased accessibility at active enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic accessibility using ATAC-seq in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing heterozygous mutations of the BAF subunit Smarca4. Cells express wild-type Smarca4-GFP and either wild-type or mutants of Smarca4-V5. Filenames and descriptions of Smarca4 in this dataset refer to the status of the Smarca4-V5 fusion in these cells.
