TITLE
Diurnal transcriptome dynamics of Japanese cedar in summer and winter

ORGANISM
Cryptomeria japonica

SUMMARY
Investigation of transcriptome dynamics of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) in winter (Dec. 22-23, 2011) and summer (July 30-31, 2012). We investigated seasonal and diurnal transcriptome dynamics of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) by analyzing shoot samples collected at four-hour interval for two days in winter and summer, respectively. We first collected sequence data of expressed genes from shoots to designed microarray probes. Microarray analysis revealed the significant difference of transcripts between summer and winter, and the diurnal transcriptome dynamic in summer.Statistical analysis indicated that about 7.7 % of unique genes showed diurnal rhythms with more than two-fold of peak-to-trough amplitude in summer.

DESIGN
Summer samples were collected at four-hour interval for two days (12 time points) from three different cuttings as biological repeats (total 36 samples). Winter samples were collected at 4:00/8:00/12:00/16:00/20:00/24:00 on Dec 22 and 12:00/24:00 on Dec 23 (total eight samples).
