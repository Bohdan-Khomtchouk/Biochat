TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs in adipose stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) are an attractive multipotent stem cell source with therapeutic applicability in diverse fields for the repair and regeneration of acute and chronically damaged tissues.In the last few years there has been increased interest in hADSCs for tissue engineering applications; however, the molecular mechanisms especially the microRNAs underlying the regulation of hADSCs proliferation and differentiation are not fully understood. To this end, we profiled the global microRNA expression in hADSCs, fibroblasts and endothelial cells by using Exqion mercury LNATM  (Exqion Inc)
