TITLE
Transcriptome changes in the cambial region of poplar (Populus alba L.) in response to water deficit

ORGANISM
Populus alba

SUMMARY
A transcriptome analysis of P. alba cambial zone was performed with the aim to unravel the gene network underlying the response to water deficit within the cambium and the differentiating derivatives cambial cells. Water stress was induced on one-year-old plant of Populus alba by withholding water for 9 days. At that time, leaf Î¨pd fell down to -0,8 MPa resulting in a significant reduction of the stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation, consistent increment of stem shrinkage and cessation of the radial growth. These effects were almost fully reversed by re-hydration. The water deficit resulted in changes in gene expression that affected a few functional categories as protein metabolism, cell wall metabolism, stress response, transporters and transcriptional regulation. The function of up- and down-regulated genes is discussed considering the physiological response of the plants to water deficit.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, Stress vs. Control, Re-hydrated vs. Stress and Re-hydrated vs Control. Each sample consists of a pool of two plants independently grown and harvested. Two technical replicates are performed for each of the three treatments. One swap replicate per array.

PLATFORM
