TITLE
Gene expression data from cervical spinal cord regions of MPTP-intoxicated mouse by acupuncture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been shown that acupuncture at acupoints GB34 and LR3 inhibits the degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. This preventative effect of peripheral acupuncture stimulation is hypothesized to be transmitted through the spinal cord to the nigrostriatal neurons. The gene expression profile changes following acupuncture at the acupoints were investigated in the cervical spinal cord of an MPTP-induced parkinsonism model using an Affymetrix genechip mouse gene 1.0 ST array.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were divided into four experimental groups; ① C: Control, ② M: MPTP-treatment only, ③ MA: MPTP- and acupuncture-treatment at acupoints GB34 and LR3, ④ MNA: MPTP- and acupuncture-treatment at non-acupoints. Total RNA was isolated from the cervical spinal cord regions of each experimental group (4 experimental group × 2 samples of each experimental group = total 8 samples).
