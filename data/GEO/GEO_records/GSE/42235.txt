TITLE
Involvement of ERK, Wnt and BMP2 signaling in human articular chondrocyte dedifferentiation in monolayer culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: When primary chondrocytes are cultured in monolayer, they undergo dedifferentiation during which they lose their phenotype and their capacity to form cartilage.  Dedifferentiation is an obstacle for cell therapy for cartilage degeneration. In this study, we aimed to systemically evaluate the changes in gene expression during dedifferentiation of human articular chondrocytes to identify underlying mechanisms.  Methods: RNA was isolated from monolayer-cultured primary human articular chondrocytes at serial passages. Gene expression was analyzed by microarray. Based on the microarray analysis, relevant genes and pathways were identified. Their functions in chondrocyte dedifferentiation were further investigated in detail.   Results: In vitro expanded human chondrocytes showed progressive changes in gene expression during dedifferentiation. Strikingly, an overall decrease in total gene expression was detected. Genes in the Wnt and BMP pathways exhibited significant changes in expression. The non-canonical rather than the canonical Wnt pathway was found to be involved in the loss of collagen II synthesis. BMP2 was able to decelerate the dedifferentiation and reinforce the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype in monolayer culture. DNA methylation was in part responsible for the expression downregulation of a set of genes.   Conclusion: Our study revealed the roles of ERK, Wnt and BMP pathways as well as DNA methylation in chondrocyte dedifferentiation in monolayer culture.

DESIGN
RNA human chondrocytes were allowed to dedifferentiate for 8 passages. RNA was isolated at week 0, 2 ,4, 6 and 8, which was subjected to whole genome gene expression analysis.
