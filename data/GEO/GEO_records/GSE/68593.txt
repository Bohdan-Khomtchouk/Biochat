TITLE
Detection of hypoxia inducible/reducible miRNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the miRNAs mediating the hypoxia in HCC, we design several groups HCC cells exposed to hypoxic conditions for several times and and submit to miRNA microarrays

DESIGN
we expose HCC cells to hypoxic conditions for 0 hrs and 8 hrs. Both groups contain 3  independent replicates
