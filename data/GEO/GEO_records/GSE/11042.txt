SUMMARY
To obtain insight into the molecular basis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and its progression by infiltrating surrounding tissue, we have performed cellular-based gene expression analysis of pure DCIS and DCIS with co-existing invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and compared the histological and molecular aspects between these morphologically identical lesions seeking to find key genes involved in DCIS progression. For that, 30 samples were evaluated, 4 non-neoplastic (N), 5 pure DCIS, 11 DCIS with co-existing IDC (DCIS-IDC) and 10 IDC. All samples were laser capture microdissected and RNAs were amplified using T7-based methodology. Microarray technology was performed using a customized cDNA platform containing 4,608 human genes. To classify the 4 sample groups according to molecular similarity we performed comparisons of their general expression pattern using ANOVA test (pFDR < 0,01) followed by TukeyÂ´s test (fold > l2l). Among the 4 sample groups, as expected, non-neoplastic cells reported the most distinct gene expression pattern. However, among the 3 groups of neoplastic cells, in contrast to morphological aspects, pure DCIS had the most distinct expression profile when compared to the other lesions: DCIS-IDC and IDC. Additionally, by comparison among pure DCIS, DCIS-IDC and N, we identified 147 genes potentially involved in DCIS progression. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster based on expression profile of this gene-set could discriminate DCIS-IDC from 60% of pure DCIS samples. Keywords: disease state analysis
