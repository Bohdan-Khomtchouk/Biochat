TITLE
Identification of candidate FOXA2-regulated genes in the adult mouse uterus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify candidate genes regulated by forkhead  transcription factor box A2 (FOXA2) in the uterus,  control and Foxa2-deleted uteri were collected at day of pseudopregnancy (DOPP) 3.5 (DOPP  0.5= vaginal plug). Microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes in the Foxa2-deleted as compared to control uteri that are candidiate FOXA2-regulated genes in the uterus.

DESIGN
Whole uteri (control wild type  n=4;  Foxa2-deleted  n=4) were analyzed for differences in their transcriptome using a mouse microarray.
