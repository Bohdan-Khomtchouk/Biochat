TITLE
Genetic characterization of large parathyroid adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We genetically characterized parathyroid adenomas with large glandular weights, for which independent observations suggest pronounced clinical manifestations. Large parathyroid adenomas (LPTAs) were defined as the 5% largest sporadic parathyroid adenomas identified among the 590 cases operated on in our institution during 2005-2009. The LPTA group showed a higher relative number of male cases and significantly higher levels of total plasma and ionized serum calcium (P < 0.001). Further analysis of 21 LPTAs revealed low MIB-1 proliferation index (0.1-1.5%), MEN1 mutations in 5 cases and one HRPT2 mutation. Total or partial loss of parafibromin expression was observed in 10 tumors, two of which also showed loss of APC expression. Using array-CGH, we demonstrated recurrent copy number alterations most frequently involving loss in 1p (29%), gain in 5 (38%) and loss in 11q (33%). Totally 21 minimal overlapping regions were defined for losses in 1p, 7q, 9p, 11 and 15q, and gains in 3q, 5, 7p, 8p, 16q, 17p and 19q. In addition, 12 tumors showed gross alterations of entire or almost entire chromosomes, most frequently gain of 5 and loss of 11. While gain of 5 was the most frequent alteration observed in LPTAs, it was only detected in a small proportion (4/58 cases, 7%) of parathyroid adenomas. A significant positive correlation was observed between parathyroid hormone level and total copy number gain (r = 0.48, P = 0.031). These results support that LPTAs represent a group of patients with pronounced parathyroid hyperfunction and associated with specific genomic features.

DESIGN
We applied high-resolution array-CGH to assess copy number alterations (CNAs) in 21 tumors representing the 5% largest sporadic parathyroid adenomas in our institution.
