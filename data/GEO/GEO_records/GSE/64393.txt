TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of DNA hydroxymethylation in osteoarthritic chondrocytes [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examination of the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in osteoarthritic chondrocytes compared to normal chondrocytes in order to elucidate the effect on OA-specific gene expression. 5hmC-sequencing was performed and data was compared with microarray gene expression data to identify genes with differential expression between normal and OA chondrocytes that are potentially under epigenetic regulation.

DESIGN
High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC in 4 normal and 4 OA chondrocyte samples.

PLATFORM
