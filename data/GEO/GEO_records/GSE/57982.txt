SUMMARY
Genome-wide mapping and characterization of novel Notch-regulated long non-coding RNAs in acute leukemia

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from samples using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Samples were then subject to PolyA  selection (Figures 1E, 5F and 5G only) using oligo-dT beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or rRNA removal (all other samples) using the Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI)  according to the manufacturers instructions. The resulting RNA samples were then used as input for library construction using the dUTP method as described by Parkhomchuck et al, 2009. RNA libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 using 50bp paired-end reads.
