ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
We ran for each studied culture (WCFS1 NZ7608 NZ7602 and NZ7603) an independent shake flask cultivation and designed one experiment. The hybridization scheme (4 arrays) of the experiment was as follows: WCFS1_respiratory NZ7608_respiratory NZ7602_respiratory NZ7603_respiratory WCFS1_respiratory. In the experiment we studied the difference in response towards respiratory cultivation (OXYGEN HEME and VITAMIN K2) of each strain compared to wild type Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
