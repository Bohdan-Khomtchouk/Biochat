ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
We ran for each studied culture (WCFS1 NZ7608 NZ7602 and NZ7603) an independent shake flask cultivation and designed one experiment. The hybridization scheme (4 arrays) of the experiment was as follows: WCFS1_respiratory NZ7608_respiratory NZ7602_respiratory NZ7603_respiratory WCFS1_respiratory. In the experiment we studied the difference in response towards respiratory cultivation (OXYGEN HEME and VITAMIN K2) of each strain compared to wild type Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Per array two cDNA labeled targets were hybridized on custom designed L. plantarum WCFS1 11K Agilent oligo microarrays (GEO Acc. Nr. GPL4318) using the Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol version 4.1. An oligo-microarray contained an average of 3 probes per transcript. Dried slides were scanned in the Scan Array Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Packard Bioscience) for both Cy3 and Cy5 at 10 microns and a PMT Gain between 40-50%.  Spot intensity data was normalized and quantified (average intensity) using a customized grid in ImaGene (BioDiscovery, Inc.). Signal intensities of all probes were corrected against background in BioArray Software Environment (BASE). The ratio of each probe (M) was defined as log [cy5 intensity/cy3 intensity] where cy3 is the wild type. Fold change (FC) is defined as 2M. For the statistical analysis we used Linear Models for Microarray Analysis (Limma) (R/limma).  Significant transcripts were defined as transcripts with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted for the pvalues of less than 1% and FC = 1.5
