TITLE
MicroRNA transcriptome profiles during swine muscle development

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Studies have been done to search for changes in miRNA expression during the muscle development in different pigs. However, research in this area has largely focused on dissecting miRNAs that are important for fetal and young muscle development. Little is known about the role of miRNAs in adult muscle development. In this study, we performed a comprehensive study on miRNA expression pattern across the muscle developmental process from embryo to adult (E90-7Years). We identified a number of differentially expressed muscle development-associated miRNAs including new members during developmental stages.

DESIGN
Nine small RNA libraries at five stages of muscle development including one prenatal stages (90-day post-gestation fetuses, E90) and four postnatal stages (0, 30, 180 days and 7 year after birth) from fifteen Jinhua female pigs were sequenced.
