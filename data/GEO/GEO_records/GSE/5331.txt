TITLE
Radiation-induced genes expressed in two murine tumors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling  was used to identify genes that display radiation-induced transcriptional change over tumor histopathology. Keywords: mouse squamous cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and mammary carcinoma, gamma-irradiation, carbon ion irradiation,  resected sample, transplanted tissues

DESIGN
C3H/HeMs male mice were irradiated by gamma-rays (30Gy, 50Gy, 70Gy) or carbon ions (30Gy) as local irradiation in single doses to hind legs where each tumor was transplanted. Animals were sacrificed either before irradiation (pre) or 1 day after irradiation (day 1) for expression analysis.
