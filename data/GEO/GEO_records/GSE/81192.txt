TITLE
Dynamic Profiles of MicroRNAome in Developing Porcine Liver

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To evaluate the roles of miRNA in porcine liver, dynamic profiles of microRNAome were investigated using liver tissue from pigs at embryonic period  (Embryonic 90 days), weaning stage (postnatal 30d) and adult stage (7 years old). In this study, we identified 503 miRNAs sequences corresponding to 472 unique miRNAs sequences, and 353 unique miRNAs were differentially expressed during liver development. We also identified that 17, 13 and 6 miRNAs were specific abundant at embryonic day 90, postnatal day 30 and year 7, respectively. Besides regulating basic cellular roles in the development and function maintain, miRNAs expressed at E90, 30d and 7 y, also participated in the regulating of “embryonic liver development”, “early hepatic growth and generating a functioning liver” and “energy metabolic processes” ,respectively. Our study indicates that miRNAs are extensively involved in liver development and provides a valuable resource for further elucidation of regulatory role of miRNAs in liver development.

DESIGN
Using high-throughput sequencing technology to reveal the characteristic of microRNAome during porcine liver development.
