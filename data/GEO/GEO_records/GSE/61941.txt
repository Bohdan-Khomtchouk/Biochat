TITLE
Time course microarray analysis during xylem cell differentiation in leaf-disk culture system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We established a novel in vitro culture system, in which vascular development can be induced in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf-disks using the specific GSK3s inhibitor. To elucidate gene expression profiles during vascular development, we performed GeneChip analysis using our newly established culture system.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis leaf disks cultured with the induction medium were sampled at every 12 hours from 0 to 48 hours.
