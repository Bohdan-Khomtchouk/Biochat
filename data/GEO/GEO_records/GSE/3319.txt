TITLE
Anti-IFN antibody 16 array set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Timecourse experiment (0hr, 2hr,6hr and 21hr) where RNA was extracted from non-rested PBMCs which were exposed to 4 different conditions- nothing (mock), interferon (IFN)gamma, IFN gamma and a non-specific antibody and IFN gamma with purified patient antibody. The purified patient antibody is demonstrated to have a specific anti-interferon gamma effect over time, with the expression profile in the arrays with IFN gamma plus patient antibody most closely resembling the mock arrays. A disease state experiment design type is where the state of some disease such as infection, pathology, syndrome, etc is studied. Keywords: disease_state_design

DESIGN
Using regression correlation
