TITLE
In vitro exposure of rat hepatocytes to a variety of toxicants, assayed by Affymetrix microarray

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
DrugMatrix is a comprehensive rat toxicogenomics database and analysis tool developed to facilitate the integration of toxicogenomics into hazard assessment.  Using the whole genome and a diverse set of compounds allows a comprehensive view of most pharmacological and toxicological questions and is applicable to other situations such as disease and development.

DESIGN
Complete Drug Matrix dataset for primary rat hepatocytes.  Cells were exposed to toxicants in culture medium and harvested after 0.67 or 1 day.
