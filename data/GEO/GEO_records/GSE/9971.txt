TITLE
CYP3A5 Gene Expression is Associated with Early Recurrence of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study to identify genes associated with NSCLC recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Purpose:  Recent clinical trials suggest improvement in survival with adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  This study's aim is to identify genes associated with NSCLC recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Experimental design: Banked NSCLC tumors of patients who underwent resection of stage Ia-IIIb disease were identified.  Patients were stratified into two groups: recurrent (R, n=11) or non-recurrent (NR, n=16) 2 years after surgery.  Microarray profiling and Cox multivariate analysis were performed. Conclusion:  Increased CYP3A5 gene expression correlates with NSCLC recurrence and promotes proliferation through mechanisms that may involve, in part, CYP3A5 epoxygenase activity. Keywords: comparison of gene expression profiles for recurrent and non-recurrent cancer

DESIGN
