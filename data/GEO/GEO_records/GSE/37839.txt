TITLE
Early-stage breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number alteration profiling of human early-stage (stage I and II) breast cancers. We aimed to describe the commonly occurred chromosome alterations in early-stage breast cancer (stage I and II) and to explore the implications of the recurrently altered regions (RAR) on the patient prognosis. For this purpose, we analyzed the DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) across the whole genome using oligoarray-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in the discovery set of EBC patients.

DESIGN
48 cases of early-stage breast cancer were used in this study.
