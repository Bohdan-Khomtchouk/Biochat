TITLE
Expression data of BRCA1 shRNA and Rad51 shRNA knockdown and control shRNA in MCF-10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair deficiency (HRD) predisposes to cancer development, but also provides therapeutic opportunities. Here, we identified an HRD gene signature that robustly predicted HRD status. Unexpectedly, concurrent loss of PTEN in BRCA1-deficient cells might extensively rewire the HR repair network and confer resistance to PARP inhibitor, partially through over-expression of TTK. We used the HRD gene signature as a drug discovery tool and found several PARP-inhibitor-synergizing agents through the connectivity map. Thus gene expression profiling can be used to define the functional status of the HR repair network providing prognostic and therapeutic information.

DESIGN
Various shRNAs that target genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) were transfected in MCF-10A non-transformed breast cells lines. Stable HR gene knockdown MCF-10A cells were seeded 200000 at 10 cm plate. Cells were harvested after 48 hours culturing and used for gene expression profiling. The shRNAs that target PTEN or BRCA1 genes were transfected in MCF-10A non-transformed breast cell line by lentiviral particles. Stable BRCA1 and PTEN knockdown MCF-10A cells were selected. Scrambled control shRNA-transfected MCF-10A cells were applying as control.  All knockdown and control MCF-10A cells were seeded with 2 x 10^5 cells at 10 cm culture plate. Cells were cultured in MCF-10A medium and harvested after 48 hours culturing.  mRNA was extracted from collected cells and performing gene expression profiling. Four biological replicates were applied. Four biological replicates were applied.
