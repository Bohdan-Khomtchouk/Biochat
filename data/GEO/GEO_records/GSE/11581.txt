TITLE
Role of FAK, dominant-negative FAK, FAK-CD and FAKsiRNA in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in proliferation, motility, adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, and survival signaling. Focal adhesion kinase has been shown to be overexpressed in many types of tumors, including breast cancer at early stages of tumorigenesis.  To study the biological role of FAK in breast tumorigenesis, we used FAKsiRNA to down-regulate FAK in MCF-7 cell lines.

DESIGN
Eight samples were analyzed in MCF-7, MCF-7-Vector, MCF-7 control (luciferase) siRNA and FAKsiRNA#1, FAKsiRNA#2
