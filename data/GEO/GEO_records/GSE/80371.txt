TITLE
Comprehensive assessment of shockwave intensity:  transcriptomic biomarker discovery for primary blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using the mammalian hair follicle

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Primary blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represents a common injury experienced during modern warfare. With virtually no apparent physical damage or symptoms presented, an effective source with minimum-invasion for mTBI biomarker discovery is required. In this study, we measure the transcriptomic sensitivity of the hair follicles in relation to the severity of primary blast-derived TBI.

DESIGN
An Advanced Blast Simulator system was used to expose rats to single pulse shockwaves with a static overpressure ranging from 15 psi to 30 psi in a head-only fashion. Blood and hair were collected for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
