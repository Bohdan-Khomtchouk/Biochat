TITLE
Combined blockade of MET and EGFR abolishes liver regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR are critically involved in initiation of liver regeneration. Other cytokines and signaling molecules also help in the early part of the process.  Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for missing signals. Elimination of any single signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling abolishes liver regeneration, prevents restoration of liver mass and leads to liver decompensation. Our results demonstrate that liver function is dependent on synchronous availability of signaling from these two pathways. The study shows that MET and EGFR separately control many non-overlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked. The combined elimination of the signals however was not tolerated. The results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and liver decompensation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in METKO-canertinib mouse liver  following a partial hepatectomy

DESIGN
Systemic inhibition MET-EGFR signaling pathway in mice liver regeneration in mice was carried out by using a tamoxifen inducible system EGFR was inhibited by using Canertinib added to diet. Partial hepatectomy was carried out and liver tissue harvested at defined time points and gene arrays carried out.
