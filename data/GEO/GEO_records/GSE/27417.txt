TITLE
Whole Transcriptome Data from Embryonic Mouse Limb-Buds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Limb development is a powerful model to investigate transcriptional complexity during differentiation and development, as tissue types appear at various stages, with unique transcriptional signatures. So far, most studies have used conventional expression arrays, which can identify only a predetermined set of cDNAs. However there is growing evidence that most of the non-coding part of the genome is transcribed as well. We took advantage of genomic tiling arrays, which cover most of the mouse genome, to look at limb transcriptomes in an unbiased manner, by identifying all genic- and intergenic transcripts. We selected three developmental stages (E11.5 ; E13.5 ; E15.5), covering a large period of limb organogenesis, during which the limb evolves from a mostly homogenous mesenchymal cell population to more specialized tissue types such as cartilage, bone, muscle and skin.
