TITLE
Gene expression changes in As4.1 cells during treatment with interleukin (IL) or hydrogen peroxide (HP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
As4.1 cells are a renin-expressing cell line commonly used to study the molecular regulation of the mouse renin gene.  In the present study, the global gene expression profile was assessed in these cells under control conditions (VEHICLE) and after treatment with interleukin (IL) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), both of which negatively regulate mouse renin gene expression.

DESIGN
For each experimental group, 2 separate cultures of As4.1 cells were used.  Cells were treated with interleukin (IL), hydrogen peroxide (HP) or vehicle control (VEHICLE). Cellular RNA was prepared using conventional methods and quality was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies).  All the microarray procedures were conducted at the University of Iowa DNA Core facility using standard Affymetrix protocols.  In brief, approximately 5 ug of total RNA was used as input to a one-step amplification procedure to generate biotin-labeled RNA fragments for hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.
