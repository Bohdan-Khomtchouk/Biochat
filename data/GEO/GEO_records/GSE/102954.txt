TITLE
ATAC-seq analyses during spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the dynamics of open chromatin at a genomic resolution during spermatogenesis, we performed ATAC-seq and detected genomic regions of accessible chromatin by Tn5 transposase during spermatogenesis. We analyzed four representative stages of spermatogenesis: Thy1+ undifferentiated spermatogonia, which contains spermatogonial stem cells and progenitor cells; c-Kit+ differentiating spermatogonia from P7 testes; purified pachytene spermatocytes (PS) undergoing meiosis; and postmeiotic round spermatids (RS) from adult testes

DESIGN
ATAC-seq analyses using purified spematogenic cells from wild-type mice and Scml2 knockout mice

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
