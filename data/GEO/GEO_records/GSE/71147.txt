TITLE
MicroRNA expression proÔ¨Åling in GC-2 cells following 50 Hz ELF-EMF

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Aberrant miRNA expression has been related to the development of human germ cell tumors, but little is known about effect of ELF-EMFs on miRNA expression. ELF-EMFs may epigenetically modify cells, which may account for the adverse effects of ELF-EMFs on the male reproductive system. To identify miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the sham and ELF-EMF exposure groups, we performed an Affymetrix microarray analysis to establish the miRNA expression profiles.
