TITLE
MicroRNA expression proÔ¨Åling in GC-2 cells following 50 Hz ELF-EMF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aberrant miRNA expression has been related to the development of human germ cell tumors, but little is known about effect of ELF-EMFs on miRNA expression. ELF-EMFs may epigenetically modify cells, which may account for the adverse effects of ELF-EMFs on the male reproductive system. To identify miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the sham and ELF-EMF exposure groups, we performed an Affymetrix microarray analysis to establish the miRNA expression profiles.

DESIGN
Mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells were intermittently exposed to a 50 Hz ELF-EMF for 72 h (5 min on/10 min off) at magnetic field intensities of 1 mT and 3 mT. miRNA expression was profiled using Affymetrix Mouse Genechip miRNA 3.0 arrays.
