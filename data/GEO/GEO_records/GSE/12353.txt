TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines exposed to six volatile organic compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of HL-60 cells were determined for two doses (IC20 and IC50) of three chemicals (ethylbenzene, tricholoretylene and dichloromethane) and for the IC50 doses of 3 other chemicals (benzene, toluene and o-xylene) at a 3 h time point. Assays were performed in triplicate for each chemical/dose, and individual gene-expression profiles were determined for each chemical at the tested concentration doses.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis was conducted on the RNA samples using 35-K whole human genome microarray (Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. Germany). Three independent experiments were performed for each chemical (N = 6), simultaneously. Labeling and hybridization were performed using the instructions of the Platinum Biochip Reagent Kit (GenoCheck Co. Ltd., Korea). This was followed by the coupling of the Cy3 dye for the controls (DMSO) and Cy5 dye for the treated samples. Hybridization was performed in a hybridization oven at 62 oC for 12 h. After washing (2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 2 min at 58 oC, 1× SSC for 2 min at RT and 0.2× SSC for 3 min at RT), the slide was dried by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 3 min at RT. Hybridization images on the slides were scanned by ScanArray Lite (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, USA). Scanned images were analyzed with GenePix 3.0 software (Axon Instruments, USA) to obtain gene expression ratios.
