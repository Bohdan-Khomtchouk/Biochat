TITLE
Nurr1 and Retinoid X Receptor ligands stimulate Ret signaling in dopamine neurons and can alleviate Î±-synuclein disrupted gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We ovexpressed human alpha synuclein alone or together with Nurr1 in mouse primary midbrain cultures and identified the full spectrum of genes whose expression is affected by alpha synuclein, including genes whose expression is normalized after Nurr1 overexpression. Moreover we treated mouse primary midbrain cultures with Bexarotene or short hairpin RNA fro Nurr1, sorted out the dopamine neurons and assessed the effects of Bexarotene and of the Nurr1 downregulation on gene expression.

DESIGN
Comparison of 3 Synuclein samples to 5 controls (RFP), Comparison of 3 Synuclein + Nurr1 samples to 5 controls (RFP), Comparison of 3 Bexarotene samples to 3 controls (DMSO), comparison of 1 short hairpin against Nurr1 to 1 control (scrambled).
