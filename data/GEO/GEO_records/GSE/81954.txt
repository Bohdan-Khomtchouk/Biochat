TITLE
A nested case-control study to investigate drivers for metastatic disease in breast cancer (QC substudy)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a quality control (QC) substudy of GSE48091. The QC substudy comprises gene-expression profiling of re-extracted tumor RNA for a subset of the tumours in the full study. As background, a population-based cohort study of metastatic breast cancer patients was first designed. Thereafter, a case-control study nested in the corresponding population-based cohort of primary breast cancer patients was designed by selecting distant metastasis-free controls to each case. Tumor RNA was extracted in the same order. All RNA was profiled on microarrays in randomized order. For quality control, RNA was also re-extracted (new tumor piece) in a randomized order for randomly selected cases-controls sets and profiled with the rest. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
The nested case-control study included 768 study subjects corresponding to 623 primary tumor samples. This QC substudy comprises 97 of the study subjects (all different primary tumor samples). Details concerning case-control status are given in the samples section. This Series includes a re-analysis of 97 samples from GSE48091. The file " full_data_matrix.txt " includes the re-normalized values for the 97 samples from GSE48091 and the normalized values for the 97 new samples from the same patients that were analyzed together.
