TITLE
Hypoxia effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells - gene and exon expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated for 48 h under normoxic or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. Changes in transcript and exon levels were analyzed.

DESIGN
6 samples; 2 conditions: normoxia vs. hypoxia (1% oxygen); 3 replicates per condition
