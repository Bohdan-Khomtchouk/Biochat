TITLE
Methylation and gene expression profiling in Dnmt3a-deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genome-wide methylation changes and aberrant gene expression profiles that occur upon deletion of Dnmt3a in a mouse model of CLL and PTCL.

DESIGN
Deletion of Dnmt3a in the hematopoietic compartment of mice results in the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma in mice (PTCL). The resulting tumors and appropriate controls were analyzed to identify changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. Specifically, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and RNA-seq analysis was performed on WT B-1a, WT CD8+ T cells, Dnmt3a+/Δ CLL, Dnmt3aΔ/Δ CLL, and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ PTCL. All mice were on the N/FVB background.
