TITLE
FZD7 Plays a Critical Role in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. Triple negative cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer usually associated with poor outcome and lack of benefit from target therapy. A pathway analysis in a microarray study was performed using TNBC compared with non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Overexpression of several Wnt pathway genes, such as frizzled homolog 7 (FZD7), Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) has been observed in TNBC. Focus was given to the Wnt pathway receptor, FZD7. To validate its function, inhibition of FZD7 using FZD7shRNA was carried out. Notably decreased cell proliferation, suppressed invasiveness and colony formation in triple negative MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells were observed. Mechanism study indicated that these effects occurred through silencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, as evidenced by loss of nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and decreased transcriptional activity of TCF7. In vivo study revealed that FZD7shRNA significantly suppressed the tumor formation in xenotransplation mice due to decrease cell proliferation. Our finding suggests that FZD7 involved canonical Wnt signaling pathway is essential for tumorigenesis of TNBC. Thus, FZD7 may be a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for triple negative breast cancer.

DESIGN
14 pretreatment non-triple negative breast tumors compare with 5 triple negative breast tumor.
