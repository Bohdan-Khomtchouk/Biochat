TITLE
Next-Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Transcriptomes in PB- and PB-TERRA-transfected 46C Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of transcriptomes in 46C mouse embryonic stem cells overexpressing PB-TERRA or PB empty vector at gene expression level. Results provide important information of the response of up-regulating TERRA, such as specific mechano-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated genes that were mainly enriched in signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from TERRA-overexpressed 46C ESCs compared to empty vector-transfected control 46C ESCs.

PLATFORM
