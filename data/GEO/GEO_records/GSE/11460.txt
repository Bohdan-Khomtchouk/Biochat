TITLE
Genomic expression patterns of mitral valve tissues from dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Evaluation of global expression patterns provides a molecular portrait of mitral valve disease, yields insight into the pathophysiologic aspects of DMVD, and identifies intriguing genes and pathways for further study. (Am J Vet Res 2006;67:1307â€“1318) Keywords: control vs diseased
