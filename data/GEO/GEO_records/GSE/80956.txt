TITLE
Chronic activation of hepatic Nrf2 has no major effect on fatty acid and glucose metabolism in adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) induces cytoprotective genes, but has also been linked to the regulation of hepatic energy metabolism. In order to assess the pharmacological potential of hepatic Nrf2 activation in metabolic disease, Nrf2 was activated over 8 weeks in mice on Western diet using two different siRNAs against kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), the inhibitory protein of Nrf2. Whole genome expression analysis followed by pathway analysis demonstrated that the suppression of Keap1 expression induced genes that are involved in anti-oxidative stress defense and biotransformation, pathways proving the activation of Nrf2 by the siRNAs against Keap1. The expression of neither fatty acid- nor carbohydrate-handling proteins was regulated by the suppression of Keap1. Metabolic profiling of the animals did also not show effects on plasma and hepatic lipids, energy expenditure or glucose tolerance by the activation of Nrf2. The data indicate that hepatic Nrf2 is not a major regulator of intermediary metabolism in mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of mouse liver samples from 8-week-old male C57BL6/J mice (N=24) treated with liver-selective Keap1-specific siRNA (group 1: siKeap1-1, N=8; group 2: siKeap1-2, N=8) or unspecific scrambled control siRNA (group 3: siControl, N=8)
