TITLE
Alterations in the transcriptome of soybean in response to enhanced somatic embryogenesis promoted by 35S:GmAGL15

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
A soybean ortholog of the Arabidopsis MADS-domain transcription factor (called GmAGL15) enhanced somatic embryogenesis from immature cotyledon explants of soybean when expressed via the 35S promoter compared to non transgenic tissue (cultivar Jack). To better understand how this occurs an expression microarray experiment was performed. publication: Q. Zheng and S.E. Perry. (2014). Alterations in the transcriptome of soybean in response to enhance somatic embryogenesis promoted by orthologs of AGAMOUS-Like 15 and AGAMOUS-Like 18. Plant Physiology, in press.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes of non-transgenic tissue to 35S:GmAGL15 tissue at the time of explant preparation (0 days) and 3 and 7 days after induction of somatic embryogenesis by placement on medium containing 2,4-D.
