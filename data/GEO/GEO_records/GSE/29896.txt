TITLE
Histone Demethylase UTX-1 Regulates the Caenorhabditis elegans Lifespan by Targeting the Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling Pathway

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Epigenetic modifications are thought to be important for gene expression changes during development and aging. However, besides the Sir2 histone deacetylase in somatic tissues and H3K4 trimethylation in germlines, there is scant evidence implicating epigenetic regulations in aging. The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is a major lifespan regulatory pathway. Here we show that progressive increases in gene expression and loss of H3K27me3 on IIS components are due, at least in part, to increased activity of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 during aging. RNAi of the utx-1 gene extended the mean lifespan of C. elegans by ~30%, dependent on DAF-16 activity and not additive in daf-2 mutants. The loss of utx-1 increased H3K27me3 on the Igf1r/daf-2 gene and decreased IIS activity leading to a more " naive " epigenetic state. Like stem cell reprogramming, our results suggest that reestablishing epigenetic marks lost during aging might help " reset " the developmental age of animal cells.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 in young and old worms without or with Utx-1 RNAi.
