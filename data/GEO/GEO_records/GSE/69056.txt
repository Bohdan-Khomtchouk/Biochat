TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse tracheal epithelial cells isolated before and 48hrs after SO2 injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conducting airway epithelium of the rodent and human lung is made up of about equal proportions of ciliated and secretory cells. In addition, in regions where the epithelium is pseudostratfied, ~30% of the epithelium consists of undifferentiated basal cells (BCs). Evidence suggests that these BCs are multipotent stem cells that can self renew over the long term and give rise to both ciliated and secretory lineages. The goal of this project is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the basal cells normally maintain the epithelium and repair it after injury. We used Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare transcripts in tracheal epithelium before and after SO2 injury.

DESIGN
Mice tracheal epithelium and mesenchyme were separate for RNA extraction before and 48hrs after SO2 injury. Cells from tracheas of 4 male C57Bl/6 mice were pooled  for each biological experiment. The experiments were repeated three times for triplicate samples.
