TITLE
Sex-biased expression profile of Schistosoma mansoni microRNAs

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Schistosoma mansoni is a dioecious species, that is, it has two differentiated sexes. Interestingly, this sexual species evolved from a hermaphrodite ancestor. Indeed, most Platyhelminthes are hermaphrodites. Here we characterize the microRNAs of S. mansoni and quantify their differential expression between males and females.

DESIGN
Mice were infected with Schistosoma mansoni 1-2 weeks prior to dissection. RNA from two independent samples were extracted and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq technology and AB SOLiD 4 technology. Reads were mapped to the reference genome and microRNA detected and analyzed.
