TITLE
8p Loss of Heterozygosity triggers metastasis and drug resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosome arm deletions are frequently observed in human cancers. Such large-scale aberrations may trigger phenotypes distinct from those that arise by loss of single genes. Using TALEN-based genomic engineering, we generated cell models with targeted 8p loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) that mimics an 8p deletion commonly found in breast cancer patients. 8p LOH triggered up-regulation of the mevalonate pathway. The alterations in lipid metabolism led to increased metastatic potential and drug resistance of 8p-deleted cells that are in agreement with poorer survival rates of breast cancer patients harbouting 8p LOH. Our findings also suggest novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of 8p LOH tumors.
