TITLE
Enrichment of Wolbachia Endosymbiont Transcripts from Host Nematode RNA by Cappable-seq

ORGANISM
Brugia malayi

SUMMARY
We report the application of Cappable-seq to selectively enrich prokaryotic endosymbiont transcripts from mixed host-symbiont total RNA.

DESIGN
Comparison of total RNA and Cappable-seq enriched RNA from Brugia malayi.
