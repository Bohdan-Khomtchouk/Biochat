TITLE
Sequencing-based ssDNA detection

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Meiotic DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) initiate genetic recombination in discrete areas of the genome called recombination hotspots. Although DSBs can be directly mapped using ChIP-Seq and antibody against ssDNA-associated proteins, genome-wide mapping of recombination hotspots in mammals is still a challenge due to the low frequency of recombination, high heterogeneity of the germ cell population and the relatively low efficiency of ChIP. To overcome these limitations we have developed a novel method, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequencing (SSDS), that specifically detects protein-bound single-stranded DNA at DSB ends. SSDS consists of a computational framework for the specific detection of ssDNA-derived reads in a sequencing library and a new library preparation procedure for the enrichment of fragments originating from ssDNA.  When applied to mapping meiotic DSBs, the use of SSDS reduces the non-specific dsDNA background more than ten-fold. Our method can be extended to other systems where the identification of ssDNA or DSBs is desired.

DESIGN
Development and validation of the method, SSDS, for the specific detection of ssDNA-derived and dsDNA-derived fragments in sequencing libraries and enrichment of ssDNA-derived fragments. SSDS was used to detect meiotic DSBs in 9R/13R mice.
