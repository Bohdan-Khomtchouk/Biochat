TITLE
Circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in hypopharyngeal carcinoma tissues vs. adjacent normal mucosae detected by microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in hypopharyngeal carcinoma tissues vs. adjacent normal mucosae detected by microarray

DESIGN
The expression profiles of circRNA in 4 pairs of hypopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and matched adjacent nomal mucosae were obtained through circRNA microarry detection.
