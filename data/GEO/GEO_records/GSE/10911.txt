TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7aro aromatase inhibitor-resistant, tamoxifen-resistant and LTEDaro lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7aro cells were used to generate a cell culture model system that is resistant to 3 aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane.  For comparison, the MCF-7aro cells were also used to generate the tamoxifen-resistant cells as well as long-term estrogen deprived, LTEDaro. Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed to determine changes in gene expression that are unique to AI-resistance. Keywords: cell lines, aromatase inhibitor resistance, tamoxifen resistance
