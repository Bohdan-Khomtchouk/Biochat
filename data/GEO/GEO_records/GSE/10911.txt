TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7aro aromatase inhibitor-resistant, tamoxifen-resistant and LTEDaro lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7aro cells were used to generate a cell culture model system that is resistant to 3 aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane.  For comparison, the MCF-7aro cells were also used to generate the tamoxifen-resistant cells as well as long-term estrogen deprived, LTEDaro. Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed to determine changes in gene expression that are unique to AI-resistance. Keywords: cell lines, aromatase inhibitor resistance, tamoxifen resistance

DESIGN
For control purposes, MCF-7aro cells were cultured without any hormone or inhibitor as well as a hormone-only control (T-only).  Resistant cells were grown in the presence of testosterone, T+LET R (letrozole), T+ANA R (anastrozole), T+EXE R (exemestane), T+TAM R (Tamoxifen).  In addition, testosterone-free resistant lines were generated, LTEDaro, ANA R and EXE R.  6 replicates were generated for the hormone-containing resistant lines and 3 replicates for the hormone-free resistant lines.
