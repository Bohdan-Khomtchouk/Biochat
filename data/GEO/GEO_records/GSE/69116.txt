TITLE
Comparison of gene expresson between larger sized tetraploid and smaller sized diploid HCA2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the factors that regulate senescence induction, we tried to identfy genes that are predominantly expressed in large sized senescent cells with tetraploid DNA.

DESIGN
We sorted large or small sized HCA2 cells treated wth IR (10Gy) according to size and structure (FSC and SSC) by FACScan and analyzed global gene expression patterns.
