TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of developing photoreceptor subtypes reveals candidate genes for avian photoreceptor diversification

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Avian photoreceptors are a diverse class of neurons, comprised of four single cones, the two members of the double cone, and rods. Many distinctive features of photoreceptor subtypes, including spectral tuning, oil droplet size and pigmentation, synaptic targets and spatial patterning, have been well characterized, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these attributes have not been explored. Furthermore, the signaling events and transcriptional regulators driving the differentiation of these diverse photoreceptors are currently unknown. Methods: To identify genes specifically expressed in distinct chicken (Gallus gallus) photoreceptor subtypes, we developed fluorescent reporters that label photoreceptor subpopulations, isolated these subpopulations using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, subjected them to next-generation sequencing, and conducted differential expression analysis. Results: We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes from photoreceptor subpopulations labeled with rhodopsin, red opsin, green opsin, and violet opsin reporters. These genes are involved in a variety of processes, including phototransduction, transcriptional regulation, cell adhesion, maintenance of intra- and extra-cellular structure, and metabolism. Of particular note are a variety of differentially expressed transcription factors, which may drive and maintain photoreceptor diversity, and cell adhesion molecules that may mediate spatial patterning of photoreceptors and act to establish retinal circuitry. Conclusions: These analyses provide a framework for future studies that will dissect the role of these various factors in the differentiation of avian photoreceptor subtypes.
