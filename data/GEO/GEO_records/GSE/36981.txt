TITLE
Expression data from Alzheimer's disease model  mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify molecular pathological alterations in AD brains, we performed interspecies comparative microarray analyses using RNAs prepared from postmortem human brain tissues donated for the Hisayama study and hippocampal RNAs from the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) Three-way ANOVA of microarray data from frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus with presence/absence of AD and vascular dementia, and sex, as factors revealed that the gene expression profile is most significantly altered in the hippocampi of AD brains. Comparative analyses of the brains of AD patients and a mouse model of AD showed that genes involved in non-insulin dependent DM and obesity were significantly altered in both, as were genes related to psychiatric disorders and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

DESIGN
3xTg-AD-H mice harboring a homozygous Psen1M146V mutation and homozygous mutant transgenes for APPSwe and tauP301L, 3xTg-AD-h mice harboring hemizygous APPSwe and tauP301L transgenes with a homozygous Psen1M146V mutation, and non-transgenic control mice (non-Tg) were used in this study, (male, n=3 for each group). RNA samples prepared from hippocampi were subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform (GPL6246).
