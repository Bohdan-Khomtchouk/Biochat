TITLE
Gene expression affected by miR-147

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental program that is often activated during cancer progression and may promote resistance to therapy. An analysis of patients (n = 71) profiled with both gene expression and a global microRNA assessment (~ 415 miRs) identified miR-147 as highly anti-correlated with an EMT gene expression signature score and postulated to reverse EMT (MET).We have found that miR-147 induced cancer cells to undergo MET phenotypically. It's necessary to investigate the genes affected by miR-147 to understand the mechanism.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from miR-147 and non-coding miR transiently transfected HCT116 cells; gene expression then assayed using the Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus2.0 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
