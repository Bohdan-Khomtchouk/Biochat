TITLE
Expression data comparing KRas(G12D/+);CreT, R26(H1047R/+);KRas(G12D/+);CreT, and MMTV-Neu mouse mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Breast Cancer (BC) has been associated with alterations in signaling through a number of growth factor and hormone regulated pathways.  Mouse models for metastatic BC have been developed using oncoproteins that activate PI3K, Stat3 and Ras signaling.  To determine the role of each pathway, we analyzed mouse mammary tumor formation when they were activated singly or pairwise. We used microarrays to detect differentially expressed genes in the KRas(G12D/+);CreT and R26(H1047R/+);KRas(G12D/+);CreT tumors

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from tumors developed by Qiagen RNAeasy kit and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
