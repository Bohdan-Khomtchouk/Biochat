ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present the case of adult medulloblastoma with minimal chromosomal rearrangements. Data presented here are aCGH analyses of two biopsies of adult patient with a medulloblastoma which was classified as a Shh subgroup.

DESIGN
Analyses were performed on 2 archival specimens of medulloblastoma, WHO Grade IV, seen at the Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital from 2007. This Series represents the CGH part of the study.
