TITLE
CD117, CD200 and CD371 identifies seven populations of γδ thymocytes programmed towards three distinct effector subsets in adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine γδ T cells include several effector subsets that fulfil distinct functional roles. In pathological conditions, such as cancer, some γδ T cell subsets are highly protective whereas other subsets may exacerbate disease. γδ T cells are programmed for their effector function during their development in the thymus. Investigations of γδ T cell development have been hampered by the scarcity of surface markers distinguishing different development stages. In this study, we found that addition of CD117, CD200 and CD371 to existing markers, allowed identification of seven distinct development stages (named A, B, C, D, E, F and G) present in both the Vγ1.1+ and Vγ2+ thymocyte subsets. We provide evidence for the existence of three distinct pathways leading to export of γδ T cells, two of which express high levels of CD24. These pathways are dominated by different TCRδ repertoires shaped by TCR signalling or lack thereof. Each pathway express distinct cytokine and transcription factor profiles associated with γδT1, γδNKT and adaptive γδ T cells. Thus, the identification of additional γδ T cell development stages in this study connects three distinct development pathways to the programming of three γδ T cell effector subsets.

DESIGN
FACS sorted TCRVγ1.1+ and TCRVγ2+ γδ thymocytes each divided into 7 populations based on expression of CD24, CD25, CD73, CD117, CD200 and CD371 pooled from 3x8 (rep1) or 2x8 (rep2) mice. Two biological replicates (rep1 and rep2).
