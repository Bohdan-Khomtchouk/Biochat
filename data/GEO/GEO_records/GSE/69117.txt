TITLE
LR11 knockout in BAT and WAT

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
To study the gene expression profiles of brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues in wild type and LR11-deficeint mice.

DESIGN
The four RNA sources, WT scWAT, Lr11 -/- scWAT, WT BAT and Lr11 -/- BAT, were prepared from subcutaneous WAT and BAT from wild-type mice and Lr11 -/- mice, respectively (n=3 each).

PLATFORM
