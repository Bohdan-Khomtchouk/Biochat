TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to norephedrine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal the molecular mechanism underling necrotic neuronal cell death caused by norephedrine, we examined alteration of gene expression profile during norephedrine exposure in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

DESIGN
The alteration of gene expression during norephedrine exposure (3 mM, 0,2 and 6 hours) in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was examined.
