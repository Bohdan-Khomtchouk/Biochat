TITLE
Effect of GnRH on miRNA expression in LbetaT2 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse immortalized LbetaT2 gonadotrope cells treated with 100 nM GnRH for 2 h.

DESIGN
GnRH treated LbetaT2 cells vs. untreated to assess whether GnRH regulates miRNA expression acutely.  Treated and untreated RNA labeled independently then hybridized together to 2-color array.  Duplicate arrays run with RNA from independent experiments.
