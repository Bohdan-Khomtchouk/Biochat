TITLE
The effects of CEP-37440, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase, in vitro and in vivo on inflammatory breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CEP-37440 at low concentration (1,000 nM) decreased the proliferation of the human inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cell line FC-IBC02, while not affecting the proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells. CEP-37440 decreased the cell proliferation of FC-IBC02 by blocking the auto-phosphorylation kinase activity of FAK (Tyr 397). This cell line did not expressed ALK. In vivo, CEP-37440 significantly decreased FC-IBC02 breast tumor xenografts growth with maximum of 40% tumor growth inhibition. None of the FC-IBC02 breast xenografts mice treated with CEP-37440 developed brain metastasis in contrast to the control group in which 20% of the mice developed brain metastasis. Expression array analyses in FC-IBC02 cells showed that CEP-37440 affects the expression of genes related to apoptosis specifically related to the interferon signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Cell proliferation assays were performed in the presence of several concentrations of CEP-37440 using IBC and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) non-IBC cell lines. We studied the expression of total FAK1, phospho-FAK1 (Tyr 397), total ALK and phospho-ALK (Tyr 1604) in these cells by ELISA. FC-IBC02 cells were treated with 1,000 nM CEP-37440 during 48 h, and expression arrays were performed in order to define pathways dysregulated by CEP-37440.
