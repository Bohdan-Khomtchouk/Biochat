TITLE
Expression data from mock- or LMO3 silenced differentiating adipose stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we aimed to gain further insight on the role of GCs in adipocyte differentiation. For the future drugability of candidate targets it is of utmost importance to find factors relevant to human biology. Thus, we analyzed the transcriptome of GC induced primary human adipose stem cells (hASC) to identify novel factors downstream of GC action We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following glucocorticoid treatment and identified distinct classes of up- and downregulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human preadipocytes (human adipose stem cells) were obtained from lipoaspirates by enzamytic digestions, followed by several steps of centrifugations (Mikkelsen et. al Cell. 2010 Oct 1;143(1):156-69.). Following isolation, human adipose stem cells were transfected with a control siRNA (siCtrl) or two different siRNA oligos targeting the gene LMO3 (siLMO3_oligo1 or siLMO3_oligo2). 40Hrs later, the transfected human adipose stem cells were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes with a adipogenic cocktail (FullMix) and RNA isolated at day 0 or day6 after induction of differentiation.
