TITLE
Genomic analysis of relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of de novo copy number abnormalities arising in relapsed paediatric ALL in matched presentation and relapse samples. We identified deletions of BACH2, (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2) at relapse. To study the role of Bach2 in pre-B ALL in a genetic experiment, we transformed pre-B cells from Bach2–/– mice with BCR-ABL1. Our findings identify Bach2 as a novel tumor suppressor upstream of p53 in pre-B ALL.

DESIGN
64 arrays (32 250K Nsp and 32 250K Sty) are included in this study. DNA was extracted from the presentation and relapse samples from 11 paediatric patients and DNA was extarcted from the remission samples from 10 patient and hybridised to the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500K Array Set.
