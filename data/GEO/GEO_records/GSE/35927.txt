TITLE
Genome-wide identification of RNA polymerase, RpoD, and RpoS binding sites in Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578

SUMMARY
Genome-wide identification of RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding sites were performed in Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 (KP). Anti-RNAP is used to capture the RNAP in KP. ChIP-chip was performed on tiling array specifically made for KP.

DESIGN
Comparison ChIP by anti-RNAP antibody vs ChIP by normal mouse IgG (control, mock IP)

PLATFORM
GPL15252 Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 Nimblegen 9822 array
