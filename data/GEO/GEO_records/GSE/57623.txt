TITLE
Global microRNA profiling of mouse hemopoietic stem cells (LSKs), promyelocytes, myelocytes and granulocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study sought to determine the dynamic changes of miRNA expression during mouse granulopoiesis. We not only performed analyses of miRNA expression levels in whole cells but also analyzed purified nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions to profile miRNA subcellular localization.

DESIGN
qRT-PCR analysis of miRNAs was performed on whole cell, nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs extracted from mouse hemopoietic stem cells (LSKs), promyelocytes, myelocytes and granulocytes. 100 ng of RNA was reversed transcribed using the Taqman miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit  and Megaplex RT Primers rodent pool A and B (Life Technologies). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified using a TaqMan rodent microRNA A and B Array v2.0 (Life Technologies) with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System.
