TITLE
TLR signaling in C57BL/6J TLR2,4,7-tolerant splenocytes over PBS-treated counterpart.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine splenocytes were isolated from the spleens of C57BL/6J mice and were pretreated in vitro for three days in the presence of Pam3CSK4 (1 μg/ml), high pure LPS from E.coli O111:B4  (100 ng/ml) and R848 (5 μg/ml). PBS-treated splenocytes served as negative control. We used Qiagen Toll-like Receptor RT2 Profiler PCR Array kit to quantitate gene expression profiling of the TLR signaling pathway.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Splenocytes from 6 mice were used and treated separately as indicated in the summary. Equal amount of total cDNA from each mouse (reverse-transcribed from 0.5 μg RNA) was used prior to gene expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL21759 Toll-like Receptor RT2 Profiler PCR Array panel
