TITLE
Effect of acute muscle unloading on soleus and gastrocnemius muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes induced by acute skeletal muscle unloading, which leads to physiological changes including muscle atrophy, fibre-type switching, and loss of ability to transition between lipid and glucose as energy source (metabolic inflexibility), was investigated by hind-limb suspension (HLS) treatment of Male ICR mice (28â€“32 g body wt; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays were utilised to examine the effects of HLS on mRNA expression profiles of the soleus muscle and the gastrocnemius muscle in the hindlimbs of freely ambulating control and 24h HLS treated mice. Keywords: treatment vs control, tissue type comparison
