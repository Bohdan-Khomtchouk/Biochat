TITLE
Expression changes during late stage retinal degeneration in rd1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
From 3 months of age the retina is known to undergo morphoplogical remodelling. This analysis examines expression in the retina after all the rod photoreceptors are lost (by 1 month) and compares the changes in expression that occur before (2 months) and after (8 months) remodelling. Total RNA was extracted from central retina regions by punch biopsy at 2 months and 8 months of age from C57Bl6/rd1 mice.

DESIGN
Each sample comprised 3-6 retina punch biposies (1.5 mm diameter) of the central retina obtained at dissection in ice-cold PBS. Three independent samples were harvested from rd1/rd1 mice at 2 months of age and three independent samples were isolated from rd1/rd1 mice at 8 months of age.
