TITLE
O-GlcNAc Aminidase is an RNA Pol II Elongation Factor Coupled to Pausing Factors SPT5 and TIF1b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq shows that OGA and O-GlcNAc are found at promoters/TSS concomitantly with the known elongation factors SPT5 and TIF1b as well as RNA pol II.  There are gene body overlaps of various combinations of factors as well.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of the indicated factors from the human BJAB B-cell line

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
