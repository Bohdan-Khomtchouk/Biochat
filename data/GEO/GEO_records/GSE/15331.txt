TITLE
mRNA expression in human hepatitis c virus (HCV) liver biopsy samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to infer the inverse expression relationships between microRNAs and mRNAs during HCV infection, we profiled both microRNA and mRNA expressions in HCV positive (HCV+) and HCV negative (HCV-) human liver biopsy tissue samples. This series includes all mRNA profiles.

DESIGN
This series includes mRNA profiles of 30 samples, 24 HCV positives and 6 HCV negatives. Each sample was repeated 4 times (3 for 3 samples) with dye swaps.
