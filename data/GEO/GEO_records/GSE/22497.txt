TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Geobacter sulfurreducens under multiple growth conditions

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA

SUMMARY
Investigation of comprehensive information about the transcripts (boundary, level, etc.)  across the entire G. sulfurreducens genome in mulitple growth conditions, including in biofilm and on electrode.

DESIGN
A five array study using total RNA recovered from two separate culture conditions of G. sulfurreducens.  G. sulfurreducens were harvested one week after growth on electrode or to form biofilm. The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used consisted of 381,174 oligonucleotide probes spaced 20 bp apart (30-bp overlap between two probes) across the G. sulfurreducens genome (NimbleGen). Experiments were conducted as two (electrode) or three (biofilm) biological replicates (different cultures).
