TITLE
ChIP-seq data of RedN-venus from asynchronous and swarmer populations of Caulobacter crescentus NA1000

ORGANISM
Caulobacter crescentus NA1000

SUMMARY
Goal: We have discovered and charactherized a new Nucleoid Associated Protein in Caulobacter crescentus, that we named RedN. To determine its global binding on C.crescentus chromosome we have performed a ChIP-seq using a strain with a RedN-Venus fusion expressed at gene loci and as single copy on the chromosome.

DESIGN
We analyzed 2 replicates for the asynchronous population and 1 replicate for the swarmer population after synchrony of RedN-venus expressed in wild type samples (Caulobacter crescentus NA1000). We also performed 1 replicate using Venus protein expressed at xylose locus as control for non-specific binding at regions of high expression, this sample was named Mock. The total DNA before Immunoprecipitation was also extracted and sequenced and used as the control for peak detection for every biological sample, this samples were called Input.
