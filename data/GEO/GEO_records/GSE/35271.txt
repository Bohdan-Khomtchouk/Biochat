TITLE
The effect of kanamycin on Paenibacillus vortex

ORGANISM
Paenibacillus vortex

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the bacteria Paenibacillus vortex comparing control untreated cells with kanamycin treated cells after 18 hours of exposure. Goal was to determine the effect of the antibiotic kanamycin in concentration which affect the colony morphology on global bacteria gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control cells vs. kanamycin treated cells. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 treated replicates. Pooling of 5 technical replicates for each biological replicate.
