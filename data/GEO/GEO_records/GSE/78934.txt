TITLE
Binding Profiles of Myc and RNA Polymerase II in Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
During the progression of cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes accelerate RNA biogenesis to meet increasing metabolic demands under exogenous hypertrophic stimuli. We have elucidated the quantitative kinetics of RNA in c-Myc (Myc)-mediated hypermetabolic analytical model using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing demonstrate that overexpressed Myc binds to a specific set of genes directly in cardiomyocytes and recruits RNA polymerase II to these genes.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequence using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes transduced by adenovirus encoding Myc or LacZ control in duplicates.
