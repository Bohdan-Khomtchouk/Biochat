TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUC-MSCs) Culutured in Chemical Defined Serum Free Medium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells maintained multipotency and immunosuppressive ability when being cultured in chemical defined serum free medium, but gained different gene expression profile. We used microarrays to identify the transcriptional difference between human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells cultured in serum containing medium and chemical defined serum free medium.

DESIGN
human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in conventional serum containing medium and chemical defined serum free medium separately. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
