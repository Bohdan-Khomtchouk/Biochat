TITLE
Ecdysone and Mediator trigger a metabolic switch uncoupling cell cycle from cell growth to end proliferation in Drosophila neural stem cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Stem cells are highly abundant and proliferate rapidly during early development but become a rare population in most adult organs. The molecular mechanisms causing stem cells to exit proliferation at a specific time are not well understood. Here, we show that changes in energy metabolism induced by the steroid hormone Ecdysone initiate an irreversible cascade of events leading to cell cycle exit in Drosophila neural stem cells. We show that the timely induction of oxidative phosphorylation and the mitochondrial respiratory chain are required in neuroblasts to uncouple cell cycle progression from cell growth. This results in a progressive reduction in neuroblast cell size and ultimately in terminal differentiation. Neuroblasts isolated from brain tumors fail to undergo this shrinkage process and this may explain why they are immortalized. Our findings show that cell size control can be modified by systemic hormonal signaling and reveal a unique connection between metabolism and proliferation control in stem cells.
