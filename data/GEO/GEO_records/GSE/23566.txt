TITLE
Aldosterone-Regulated Expression Data in Mouse Aorta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The steroid hormone aldosterone plays a role in vascular function and disease. Aldosterone activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. MR have been found to be expressed in vascular cells and vessels. We used microarrays to identify the global programme of gene expression changes in mouse aortas treated with vehicle (DMSO) or aldosterone.

DESIGN
Wild type C57Bl6 male mice were treated with spironolactone (20 mg/kg/day, an MR antagonist) for 5 days by Sub-cutaneous pellet to suppress basal MR-mediated gene expression. Aortas were then harvested and treated ex vivo in organ culture with vehicle or 100 nM aldosterone for 2, 4, or 8 hours. Three aortas were pooled for each timepoint and treatment, and three pooled biological replicates were performed.
