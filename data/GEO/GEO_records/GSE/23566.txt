TITLE
Aldosterone-Regulated Expression Data in Mouse Aorta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The steroid hormone aldosterone plays a role in vascular function and disease. Aldosterone activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. MR have been found to be expressed in vascular cells and vessels. We used microarrays to identify the global programme of gene expression changes in mouse aortas treated with vehicle (DMSO) or aldosterone.
