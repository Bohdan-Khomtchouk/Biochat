TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of hypoxic cells and identification of HEXIM1-dependent genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify primary response genes (PRGs) that were differently expressed within 1 hr of hypoxia exposure, we performed global transcriptional profiling using the Agilent Technologies SurePrint G3 Human GE Microarray . To identify Hexim1-dependent genes, we compare profiles of hypoxia PRGs in cells transfected with control or Hexim1 targeting double-strand siRNA

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transfected with control and HEXIM1-targeted double-strand siRNA and 48 hr after treated with IL-1beta in combination with normoxia or hypoxia (5% CO2, 0.5% O2, balanced with N2)  O for 1 hr.
