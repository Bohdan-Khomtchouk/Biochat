TITLE
Combinatorial role of Jmjd2b and Jmjd2c in mESCs identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide occupancy of biotinylated Jmjd2b, Jmjd2c from mESCs, as well as occupancy of selected factors and histone marks from wild-type mESCs, Anti-GFP KD, Jmj2b KD and Jmjd2c KD mESCs genome

DESIGN
To identify genome-wide binding target sites of Jmjd2b and Jmjd2c in the mESCs genome, and genome-wide binding sites for selected factors and histone marks from Anti-GFP KD, Jmjd2b KD and Jmjd2c KD mESCs

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL14759 Helicos HeliScope (Mus musculus)
