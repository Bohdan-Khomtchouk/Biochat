TITLE
Role of RfaH in Yersinia enterocolitica O:3

ORGANISM
Yersinia enterocolitica

SUMMARY
To assess the effects of rfaH mutation on gene expression, RNA sequencing was carried out using the RNA extracted from rfaH mutant and wild type bacteria cultivated at both 22˚C and 37˚C. Additionally, to differentiate between genes affected directly by the rfaH mutation and those affected by the O-antigen negative phenotype, the Y. enterocolitica O:3 strain YeO3-R1 missing the O-antigen was included in the RNA-sequencing study. At RT-grown bacteria altogether 77 (45 up- and 32 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes were identified. At 37ºC, on the other hand, 44 genes were differentially expressed; 14 genes up- and 30 genes down-regulated. The RNA-sequencing data of YeO3-R1 was available only for bacteria grown at 22˚C and the comparison revealed that 22 of the 102 genes were similarly differentially expressed both in rfaH and YeO3-R1 mutants.  To detect genes regulated directly or indirectly by Hfq, deep RNA-seq was performed with RNA isolated from Y. enterocolitica wild-type strain 6471/76 and the YeO3-hfq::Km strain. Total RNA was isolated from two biological replicas of bacteria grown in LB to logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.6) at two different temperatures, RT and 37°C. knocking out of Hfq affected the transcription of 346 genes at RT and 541 genes at 37°C, i.e., ca. 8 and 12.5 % of the Y. enterocolitica genes, respectively. At RT, of the 346 genes 216 genes were down- and 132 up-regulated, and at 37°C, of the 541 genes, 96 were down- and 445 up-regulated. A total of 95 genes were differentially expressed both at RT and 37°C; 27 showed down- and 59 up-regulated. For 9 genes opposite changes took place depending on the growth temperature.

DESIGN
Bacterial RNA profiles of wild type, rfaH- and hfq- strains were generated using deep sequencing, in duplicates, under two growth temperatures (22°C and 37°C). The RNA-sequencing data of YeO3-R1 was generated only from bacteria grown at 22˚C.
