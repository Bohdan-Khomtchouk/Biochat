TITLE
RNA_seq and Ribo_seq analyses of control and Nutlin3a-treated MCF7 cells (20 hrs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses to examine the effect of Nutlin3a (activator of p53) treatment of translation efficiency (TE)

DESIGN
We measured expression levels (RNA.seq) and ribosome densities (ribo-seq) in control and Nutlin3a-treated (20 hrs) MCF7 cells
