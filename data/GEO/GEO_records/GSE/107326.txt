TITLE
Oncogenic Kras synergizes with enhanced TGF-beta-Foxd4 signaling to maintain leukemia-initiating cells in acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, the expression profiles of the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GMP) in bone marrow from KrasG12D/+; CD2Cre mice and wild-type mice were utilized as the in vivo model of acute-myeloid leukemic initiating cells for comparison. We compared the microarray data for transcriptional analysis of the GMP cells from KrasG12D/+; CD2Cre+ mice and littermate control.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on GMP cells sorted from leukemic KrasG12D/+; CD2Cre+ mice and littermate control.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
