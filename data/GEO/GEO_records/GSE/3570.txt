TITLE
cDNA array of the new human breast cancer cell line EM-G3 derived from breast cancer progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression with cDNA array showed high expression levels of apoptosis activator Apaf1, membrane proteins CD44 and TGFR1β, integrin family members α2, α3, α6, αV and β1, p53 regulator MDM2, p21Ras GTP-ase activating molecule RasA1, and extracellular matrix-associated protein thrombospondin I. Expression of EGFR confirmed the immunocytochemical results, and expression of integrin α6 and CD44 support basal epithelial character of the EM-G3 cells. Keywords: cDNA array, breast cancer cell line
