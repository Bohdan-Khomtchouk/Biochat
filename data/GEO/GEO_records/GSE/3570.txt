TITLE
cDNA array of the new human breast cancer cell line EM-G3 derived from breast cancer progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression with cDNA array showed high expression levels of apoptosis activator Apaf1, membrane proteins CD44 and TGFR1β, integrin family members α2, α3, α6, αV and β1, p53 regulator MDM2, p21Ras GTP-ase activating molecule RasA1, and extracellular matrix-associated protein thrombospondin I. Expression of EGFR confirmed the immunocytochemical results, and expression of integrin α6 and CD44 support basal epithelial character of the EM-G3 cells. Keywords: cDNA array, breast cancer cell line

DESIGN
GEArray Q series Human Cancer PathwayFinder array kit was obtained from SuperArray Inc (see www.superarray.com for details). RNA (3 μg) from EM-G3 cells was used as a template to generate 32P-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) labeled cDNA probes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA probes were denatured and hybridized overnight at 60°C with the SuperArray membrane. The membrane was washed, and analyzed by scanning the Kodak BioMax X-Omat X-ray film (Amersham Biosciences).
