TITLE
Effects of Dcp1a and Dcp2 knockdown during mouse oocyte maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oocyte maturation is accompanied by a transition from mRNA stability to instability.  We investigated the role of DCP1A and DCP2, proteins responsible for mRNA decapping,  in mRNA destabilization during mouse oocyte maturation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of both Dcp1a and Dcp2 transcripts prior to initiation of maturation inhibited the maturation-associated increase of DCP1A and DCP2, stabilized a set of maternal mRNAs that are normally degraded during maturation, and inhibited development beyond the 2-cell stage, likely a consequence of failure to activate fully the zygotic genome.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 30 MII eggs was used in each sample. Three independent biological replicates were analyzed for each condition.
