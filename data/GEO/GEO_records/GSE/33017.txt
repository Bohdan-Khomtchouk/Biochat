TITLE
Expression profile of third instar larval salivary gland tissue

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We use mRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile larval salivary gland tissue from Drosophila third instar larvae. These data provide insights into tissue physiology and can be used to identify tissue specific transcripts.

DESIGN
Salivary glands were dissected from 200 wandering third instar larvae and the associated fat body was removed.Salivary glands were transferred to Graces unsupplemented medium on ice prior to RNA extraction with TRIzol reagent. mRNA-seq samples were prepared from 10 ug of total RNA and subject to Illumina based sequencing.
