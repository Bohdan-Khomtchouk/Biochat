TITLE
Genome-wide association studies for sheep growth and meat production traits using Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Mear prodution is the most important trait for sheep. In this study, we performed a Genome-wide association study (GWAS) by using Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip in 329 purebred sheep phenotyped for 11 growth and meat production traits (birth weight, weaning weight, 6-month weight, eye muscle area, fat thickness, pre-weaning gain, post-weaning gain, daily weight gain, height at withers , chest girth and shin circumference). A total of 319 sheep and 48,198 SNPs were fitted using TASSEL 3.0 software as random effects in a mixed linear model. 36 chromosome-wise significant SNPs were identified for 7 traits and 10 of them reached genome-wide significance level consistently for post-weaning gain. Gene annotation was implemented based on the latest version3.1 ovine genome sequence (released October 2012), and meanwhile we referenced genomic information of human, bovine, mouse and rat. More than one-third SNPs (14 out of 36) were located within ovine genes , some other were located close to ovine genes (878bp-398165bp apart).

DESIGN
329 sheep DNA were scanned using OvineSNP50 Beadchip and  the association is done between the SNP data and 11 different meat prodution traits
