TITLE
Functional genomics of Aspergillus fumigatus conidiospores interacting with human bronchial epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
The cells of the airway epithelium play critical roles in host defense to inhaled irritants, and in asthma pathogenesis. These cells are constantly exposed to conidiospores of the ubiquitous mould Aspergillus fumigatus, which are small enough to reach the alveoli. This exposure is asymptomatic in most individuals but can be associated with a spectrum of diseases ranging from asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis to aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis. Airway epithelial cells have been shown to internalize A. fumigatus conidiospores in vitro, but the implications of this process for pathogenesis remain unclear. We have developed a cell culture model for this interaction using the 16HBE cell line and a transgenic A. fumigatus strain expressing green fluorescent protein. The transcriptional profiles of A. fumigatus conidiospores incubated in the presence or absence of human cells were compared, revealing significant changes in fungal gene expression in response to conidial interaction with cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels were investigated in A. fumigatus conidiospores incubated in the presence or absence of 16HBE cells for 6 hours. Four independent samples were analysed for each of these conditions, using JCVI PFGRC Aspergillus fumigatus Version 3 microarrays, with a dye-swap experimental design.

PLATFORM
GPL5346 JCVI PFGRC Aspergillus fumigatus 22K v3 array designed primarily based on strain Af293
