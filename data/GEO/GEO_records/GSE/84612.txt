TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of Ta, Tbx16 and Mixl1 binding in early zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Identification of Ta and Tbx16 binding sites during gastrulation, and Mixl1 binding sites during endoderm specification

DESIGN
Replicate ChIP samples for Ta, Tbx16 and Mixl1 with matched input samples - 6x ChIP samples (2 per factor); 3x input samples
