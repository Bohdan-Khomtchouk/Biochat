Expressing profiles of small non-coding RNA in mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR)

SUMMARY
Pathologic ocular angiogenesis is a common cause of blindness in proliferative retinopathy. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) play critical roles in normal development and diseases, and their function in eye diseases and angiogenesis are increasingly recognized. In the present study, we aimed to identify the function and therapeutic potential of sncRNAs in retinopathy. We used microarray to analyze the retinal expression profile of sncRNAs in a mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model that mimic human proliferative retinopathy.
