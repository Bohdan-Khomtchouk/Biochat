TITLE
Effect of DBC1/CCAR2 depletion on global gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deleted in breast cancer (DBC1; also known as CCAR2) is a coactivator for nuclear receptors (NRs) as well as a negative regulator of epigenetic modifiers such as deacetylases SIRT1 and HDAC3. We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in control (shNS) and DBC1-depleted (shDBC1) MDA-MD-231 cells to investigate global gene expression changes induced by depletion of DBC1

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shNS or shDBC1 using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity of RNA was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Two independent biological replicates were assayed for each sample. The microarrays were performed following the Affymetrix standard protocol.
