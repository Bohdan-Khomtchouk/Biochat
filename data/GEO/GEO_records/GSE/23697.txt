TITLE
Gene expression profiling in skeletal muscle 3 hours following the performance of an eccentric exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eccentric exercise (ECC) can result in ultra-structural and histological damage to skeletal muscle. The damage incurred following ECC is typically followed by a subsequent regenerative and adaptive response. The specific mechanisms that drive this response, particularly in human muscle, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to characterize the early molecular response in skeletal muscle following ECC in humans. We used an Agilent whole human genome microarray to assess global gene expression in male subjects (N=35) at 3 hours post-100 eccentric contractions of the knee extensors. ANCOVA (age and BMI covariates) was used to compare mRNA expression between the ECC and non-exercised (CON) legs of each subject. Novel transcripts from IPA identified networks were confirmed with quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. qRT-PCR analysis of 3 of these transcripts (IkBÎ±, TNFRSF1A and ICAM-1) confirmed changes observed in the microarray analysis.

DESIGN
35 male subjects performed an eccentric exercise protocol consisting of 100 maximal eccentric contrations of the knee extensors.  3 hours after the completion of the exercise regimen, a muscle biopsy was taken from the vastus lateralis of both legs. The non-exercised leg served as the control. Gene expresssion was analyzed using an ANCOVA, with covariates for age and BMI.
