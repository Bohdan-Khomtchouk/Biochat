TITLE
microRNA expression profiles from three arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) patients' skin fibroblasts with recessive SLC2A10 mutations [miRNA]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To screen for potential miRNA that may contribute to the pathomechanisms of ATS miRNA expression profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® miRNA 3.0 Array comparing the miRNA expression changes of skin fibroblasts of three ATS patients with those of three healthy individuals
