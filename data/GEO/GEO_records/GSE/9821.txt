TITLE
The differentiation/retrodifferentiation program of human U937 leukemia cells is accompanied by changes of VCP/p97

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A possible functional role of VCP/p97 during differentiation of U937 cells was addressed by siRNA-targeting of VCP/p97. Functional changes in VCP-siRNA-transfected cells following phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation have been examind by DNA microarray analysis. Cells transfected with the non-targeting AllStars negative siRNA (Qiagen) served as a reference. Keywords: cellular modification design
