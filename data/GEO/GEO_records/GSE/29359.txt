TITLE
Analysis of p53 target genes in melanoma part 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although mutations in p53 are infrequent in human melanoma, its function is abnormal. In this study, whole genome bead arrays were used to examine the expression of p53 target genes in extracts from 82 metastatic melanoma samples, compared to extracts derived from diploid human melanocytes, to provide a global assessment of aberrant p53 function.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 82 tumour samples and 8 melanocyte cell lines was analysed. Metastatic melanomas were compared to melanocyte cell lines.
