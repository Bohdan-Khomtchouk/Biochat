TITLE
Expression data from mouse differentiated T helper cell lineages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray data on TH cell subsets from WT C57BL/6 and Bhlhe40 KO mice We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in polarized TH cell lineages

DESIGN
Purified na√Øve CD4 T cells from spleen were polarized in vitro and then activated with PMA/Ionomycin prior to microarray analysis

PLATFORM
