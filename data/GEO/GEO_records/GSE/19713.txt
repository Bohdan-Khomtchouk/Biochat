TITLE
Expression data of 3 prostate cancer stem cell primary lines comparing spheres and parental/adherent culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of PCSC spheres in SCM-1% KO (stem-like cells) vs adherent cultures in PCSC-Celprogen medium (differentiated-like cells) Two-condition experiment: Sphere vs. Parental/adherent cells. Biological replicates: 2 sphere replicates , 2 adherent replicates.

DESIGN
Early passaged tumor cells were expanded in adherent conditions and then plated in sphere forming conditions (SCM-1KO% medium at low density) to isolate sphere growing cells.
