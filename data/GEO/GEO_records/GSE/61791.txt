TITLE
Expression data from 7 cell lines in early and late stages and their corresponding tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Sarcoma oncogenesis is still poorly understood and there is a pressing need to generate cell lines representative of diverse sarcoma types. Methods: We submitted to culture all sarcoma from patients receiving surgery in a large tertiary referral centre in France. Of the 32 established cell lines we report the genomic and transcriptomic study of 7 which were extensively tested for the representativeness to the original tumor and the evolution over passages. Results: Pleomorphic sarcomas are genetically heterogeneous. As a consequence, cell lines derived from that kind of tumor developed from selected clones roughly representing the initial tumor. More importantly our results show that there are no genetic imbalances and transcription modifications along passages. Conclusions: This likely means that even if pleomorphic sarcomas are genetically unstable at the cellular level, they appear to be genetically stable at the multicellular one and therefore remain representative of the initial tumor even after passages. We established a sarcoma cell line panel gathering 32 cell lines with genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data, which will be very powerful to go further in the understanding of genomic alterations, sarcoma biology and to manage preclinical studies and clinical trials.
