TITLE
A germline mutation in SRRM2, a splicing factor gene, is implicated in papillary thyroid carcinoma predisposition

SUMMARY
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) displays strong but so far largely uncharacterized heritability. Here we studied genetic predisposition in a family with six affected individuals. We genotyped all available family members and conducted whole exome sequencing of blood DNA from two affected individuals. Haplotype analysis and other genetic criteria narrowed our list of candidates to a germline variant in the serine/arginine repetitive matrix 2 gene (SRRM2). This heterozygous variant, c.1037C > T (Ser346Phe or S346F; rs149019598) cosegregated with PTC in the family. It was not found in 138 other PTC families. It was found in 7/1,170 sporadic PTC cases and in 0/1,404 controls (p=0.004). The encoded protein SRRM2 (also called SRm300) is part of the RNA splicing machinery. To evaluate the possibility that the S346F missense mutation affects alternative splicing, we compared RNA-Seq data in leukocytes from three mutation carriers and three controls. Significant differences in alternative splicing were identified for 1,642 exons, of which a subset of 7 exons was verified experimentally. The results confirmed a higher ratio of inclusion of exons in mutation carriers. These data suggest that the S346F mutation in SRRM2 predisposes to PTC by affecting alternative splicing of unidentified downstream target genes.

DESIGN
We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of polyadenylated RNA transcripts extracted from blood samples obtained from three PTC patients heterozygous for the SRRM2 mutation and from three wildtype controls. *The submitters declare they do not have approval to share the raw data.*
