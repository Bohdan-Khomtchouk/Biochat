TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the mouse oviduct during the estrous cycle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study attempted to reveal the profile of the oviductal gene expression at each stage of estrous cycle by microarray analyses

DESIGN
The oviductal tissue was separately collected at four stages of the estrous cycle, i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus.
