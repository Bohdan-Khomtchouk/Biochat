TITLE
MicroRNA expression abnormalities in pancreatic endocrine and acinar tumours are associated with distinctive pathologic features and clinical behavior

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the global microRNA expression patterns in normal pancreas, pancreatic endocrine tumours and acinar carcinomas to evaluate their involvement in transformation and malignant progression of these tumour types.

DESIGN
A neoplastic cellularity higher than 90% was obtained by cryostat enrichment. RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from 10 20-Î¼m thick cryostat sections, checking the cell composition of the sample every five sections. RNA integrity was confirmed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). microRNA microarray (Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, version 2.0) contains probes for 460 mature microRNAs spotted in quadruplicate (235 homo sapiens, 222 mus musculus, and three Arabidopsis thaliana) with annotated active sites. Often, more than one probe set exists for a given mature microRNA.
