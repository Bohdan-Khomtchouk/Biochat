TITLE
mRNA sequencing of Trim71 conditional ( " WT " ) and Trim71 KO mES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Trim71 mutation does not lead to significant changes within the core regulatory network of mES cells, however, there is an upregulation of specific genes involved in neural differentiation. We thus conclude that Trim71 KO mES cells are poised for differentiation.

DESIGN
Analysis of changes in the expression of mRNAs in two different genotypes

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
