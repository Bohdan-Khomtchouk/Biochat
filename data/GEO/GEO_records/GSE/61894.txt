TITLE
Gene Expression data from Pdx-1CreAPC+/LP53L/L pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells versus Pdx-1CreP53L/L normal pancreatic ductal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary PDAC cells established from Pdx-1CreAPCL/+p53L/L and Pdx-1Crep53L/L mice. APC haploinsufficiency combined with P53 loss in the pancreas drives MCN progression in mice. Results provide insight into  molecular mechanisms  invloved in the MCN formation of Pdx-1Cre APCL/+P53L/L mice.

DESIGN
Pdx-1CreAPC+/LP53L/L PDAC cell lines and 2  Pdx-1CreP53L/L ductal cell lines were analyzed.
