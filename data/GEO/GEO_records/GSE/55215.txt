TITLE
Genomewide analysis of QKI-dependent alternative splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify QKI targets, we performed QKI knockdown in BEAS2B cells and analyzed alternative splicing patterns by high-throughput RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of control- and QKI-knockdown BEAS2B cells were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx sequencer.
