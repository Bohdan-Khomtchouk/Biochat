TITLE
Liposome transfection of miR-145 induces immune response via RIG-I in mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liposomal transfection reagents are frequenly used in gene deliverytransfer experiments. The validity of these experiments depends on the absence of changes in genes other than the target gene. Here we report that transfection of synthetic microRNA-145 using liposomes, but not electroporation, induced the upregulation of a range of immune-related genes in human mesenchymal stem cells. The immune response was dependent on the binding of microRNA-145 to retinoic acid inducible gene-I, and was independent on endosome functionality and toll-like receptors. Immune response was not observed after transfection of any of nine other small RNAs, suggesting a sequence restricted response. One of the upregulated mRNAs encode interferon Î², which presumably in turn induced the upregulation of another group of immune associated genes. Interestingly, exposure of liposomes alone led to the upregulation of some immune genes, one of them retinoic acid inducible gene-I mRNA.
