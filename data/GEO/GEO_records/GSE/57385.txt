TITLE
Determination of decay rates across the transcriptome and identification of controlling features

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this work, we determine andenylated and total mRNA decay rates and correlate them with codon optimality. We conclude that optimality is a major contributor to mRNA stability in budding yeast.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling was done on 10 time points using two different library prep methods and sequenced using a paired end protocol on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. A biological duplicate was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
