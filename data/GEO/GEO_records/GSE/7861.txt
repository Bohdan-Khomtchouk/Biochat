TITLE
Angiogenesis study of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we report a novel nanomedicine (Gd@C82(OH)22 ) effectively inhibit  human breast tumor growth by antiangiogenesis in vivo. To further identify which angiogenic factor(s) were affected on mRNA level, the " RT² Profiler™ PCR Array Mouse Angiogenesis (APMM-024, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation) " was used. Keywords: nanomedicine, Gd@C82(OH)22, angiogenesis, MCF-7, breast cancer

DESIGN
In the experimental group, the tumor bearing mice were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) [Gd@C82(OH)22]n saline solution once a day at the dose of 2.5mM/kg, after the tumor tissue implantation into the animal for 7 days, continuing until the mice were sacrificed. The 0.9% saline soultion was used as control. At the end of the experiment, parts of the tumor tissue was collected, and further be analyzed by PCR-array.
