TITLE
Expression data from Burkitt lymphoma cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Burkitt lymphoma is the commonest cancer in children in Africa. We compared the gene expression profiles of African Burkitt lymphoma patients with those of cases presented in  Western countries in both immunocompetent (sporadic Burkitt lymphoma) and HIV-infected patients (immunodeficiency associated Burkitt lymphoma). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in different subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma.

DESIGN
Lymph-node biopsies were collected at diagnosis. Gene expression profiles were generated with the Affymetrix HG U133 2.0 plus microarray
