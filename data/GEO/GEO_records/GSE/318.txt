TITLE
MK-DG vs MK C+S-DG

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MK: MK-801. Young male C57BL/6J mice received an injection of MK-801 (300 micro-g per g body weight). RNA from control mice were extracted 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, and 6hr after MK experimental mice received their last shock treatment. MK C+S: MK-801 & Context + Shock: Young male C57BL/6J mice received an injection of MK-801 (300 micro-g per g body weight) 1 h prior to contextual fear conditioning that consisted of: Placement into a novel spatial context for 2 min. After 2 min, a 1 sec (0.5 mA) shock was administered through a floor grid. The 2 min-1 sec shock paradigm was repeated for a total of 3 shocks. 1 min after the last shock, animals were removed to their homecage. RNA was extracted 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, and 6hr after the last shock treatment. Keywords: time-course
