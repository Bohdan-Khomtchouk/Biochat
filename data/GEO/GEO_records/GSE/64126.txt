TITLE
Identification of the gene(s) responsible for ocular abnormalities of Hirosaki Small Eye Rat (HiSER)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
HiSER, established in our laboratory, exhibits ocular abnormalities including opacity, lens involution, and retinal detachment. To identify a causative gene(s) of the HiSER phenotype, microarray analysis was performed between HiSER and normal (SDR) eyes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from HiSER and normal (SDR) eyes, and subjected to microarray analysis.
