TITLE
Genome-wide expression kinetics of children with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) -associated autoantibodies or progression towards clinical T1D, compared to healthy matched controls .

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To unravel genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of prospective venous blood samples from children developing T1D-associated autoantibodies or progressing towards clinical diagnosis.

DESIGN
357 peripheral blood RNA samples from 10 autoantibody-positive children (Case) and their matched controls (Control) or alternatively 18 prediabetic children (T1DCase) and their matched controls (T1DControl) were analyzed with Affymetrix U219 gene array, in order to study the gene expression changes occuring during the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Each case child (positive for T1D-specific autoantibodies) was matched with a persistently autoantibody-negative control child, with the same HLA-DQB1 risk category, gender, and place and date of birth. Seroconversion is determined as the first detection of T1D-specific autoantibody/autoantibodies (ICA titre > 4 JDFU, IAA > 3.47 RU, GADA > 5.4 RU, IA-2A > 0.43 RU, ZnT8A > 0.61 RU). Two control children were selected for T1D cases 3, 5, 13 and 17. Case5 & T1DCase15 and  Case7 & T1DCase3 share the same matched control. Sample T1DControl7_4 was excluded from the final analysis as an outlier, resulting in 356 total Samples listed below.
