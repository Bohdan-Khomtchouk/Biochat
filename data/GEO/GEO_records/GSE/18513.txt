TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana young flowers: Wild type vs. sdg2-1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in young flowers (stage 8) of Arabidopsis wild type control plants and sdg2-1 mutant is performed using Aligentâ€™s Whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F, V4, 4x44K). A significant number of genes involved in gametophyte development are found differentially regulated in the sdg2-1 mutant.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, young flowers of wild type control vs. young flowers of sdg2-1 mutant. Two biological replicates: 2 control, 2 mutant, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
