TITLE
Global variation of copy number in the human genome_COMM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify and categorize copy number variation in normal populations Keywords: Copy number variation detection

DESIGN
270 Hapmap samples were hybridized to 500K mapping arrays (Nsp and Sty) to identify variable copy number regions in the genome. NA15510 and NA10851 were hybridized to 500K mapping arrays in triplicate for parameter-tuning and validation of algorithm.
