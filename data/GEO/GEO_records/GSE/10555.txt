TITLE
Comparision of expression profile between wild-type and Slc39a13 knockout osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to explore molecules whose expression is controlled by Slc39a13, we investigated gene expression profiling of primary osteoblast isolated from wild-type and Slc39a13 knockout mice. Keywords: knockout vs wild-type

DESIGN
wild-type vs Slc39a13 knockout
