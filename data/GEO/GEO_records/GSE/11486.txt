TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Salmonella typhimurium wt, hfq and smpB mutants in four different growth conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
S. typhimurium 14028 wt, hfq and smpB were harvested from log phase LB (LBlog); (2), stationary phase LB (LBstat); (3) 4h MgM medium pH 5.0 after resuspension of LB stat culture (MgMshock); and (4) log phase MgM medium pH5.0 after 100fold dilution of an LB stat culture (MgMDil). Total RNA was extracted, cDNA labeled and hybridized to a non-redundant Salmonella whole genome PCR product ORF array.

DESIGN
S. typhimurium 14028 cells were harvested, on three separate days,  (1), after growth at 30째C to log phase in LB (LBlog); (2), after growth at 30째C to stationary phase in LB (LBstat); (3) after transfer of a stationary phase culture grown in LB into magnesium-deficient MgM medium [100 mM Tris-Cl, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% Casamino acids, 8uM MgCl2] pH 5.0 and growth for four more hours at 30째C (MgMshock); (4) after 100fold dilution of a stationary phase culture grown in LB into magnesium-deficient MgM medium pH5.0 and growth at 30째C to log phase (MgMDil). This procedure was performed on (A), wild type [WT] cells; (B), cells of an hfq- (STM4361) knockout mutant; and (C), cells of an smpB- (STM2688) knockout mutant, resulting in 36 samples total. Total RNA was extracted, cDNA labeled with Cy5-dCTP and hybridized versus Cy3-labeled 14028 gDNA to a non-redundant Salmonella whole genome PCR product ORF array.
