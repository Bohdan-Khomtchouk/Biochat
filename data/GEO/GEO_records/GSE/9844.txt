TITLE
Transcriptomic Dissection of Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The head and neck / oral squamous cell carcinoma (HNOSCC) is a diverse group of cancers, which develop from many different anatomic sites and are associated with different risk factors and genetic characteristics. The oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is one of the most common types of HNOSCC. It is significantly more aggressive than other forms of HNOSCC, in terms of local invasion and spread. In this study, we aim to identify specific transcriptomic signatures that associated with OTSCC. Keywords: Disease/Control analysis

DESIGN
26 OTSCC samples and 12 control samples were analyzed using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array.
