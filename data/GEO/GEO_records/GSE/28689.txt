TITLE
CO1 network analysis in poplar

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
We conducted microarray experiments by comparing constitutive constructs with appropriate controls, followed by the identification of downstream targets of Pro35S:CO1

DESIGN
Four samples of mature leaf tissues were collected from four independent lines of 35S:CO1 and pBI101. RNA was extracted from tissues and hybridized on Affymetrix Genechip Poplar Genome Array.
