SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Yijun Ruan ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Transcriptome Project. It shows the starts and ends of full length mRNA transcripts determined by GIS paired-end ditag (PET) sequencing using RNA extracts ( ) from different sub-cellular localizations ( ) in different cell lines ( ). The RNA-PET information provided in this track is composed of two different PET length versions based on how the PETs were extracted. The cloning-based PET (18 bp and 16 bp) is an earlier version and detailed information can be found from reference (Ng et al. 2006). The cloning-free PET (25 bp and 25 bp) is a recently modified version which uses Type II enzyme EcoP15I to generate a longer length of PET (unpublished), which results in a significant enhancement in both library construction and mapping efficiency. Both versions of PET templates were sequenced by Illumina platform at 2 x 36 bp Paired End sequencing. See the Methods and References sections below for more details.
