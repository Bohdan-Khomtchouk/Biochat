TITLE
RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional effects of G quadruplex stabilization by the G4 ligand PhenDC3 in HT-1080 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G quadruplex motifs are frequently located near TSS and in the first introns of transcribed genes. We investigated the role that G4 structures play in transcription by stabilizing G4 DNA with the selective G4 ligand PhenDC3 in the HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line. After treatment of triplicate samples with PhenDC3 or a negative control (DMSO carrier only), we performed RNA-Seq after poly-dT selection to assess changes in gene and isoform expression, as well as changes to splicing patterns.

DESIGN
6 samples total; 2 gene expression conditions (treated and untreated) in triplicate; 4 raw sequencing files per sample

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
