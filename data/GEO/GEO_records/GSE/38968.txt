TITLE
Gene expression profiling in liver from control versus mutant Sox17 SHIVA fasted C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to test the impact of a mutation in the Sox17 gene (SHIVA mouse) on the ability of liver to mount a transcriptional response to 24 hours of fasting.

DESIGN
Control female C57BL/6 versus SHIVA mice were fasted for 24 hours. Livers from 3 control and 4 SHIVA mice were harvested. RNA was purified for each individual mouse and reverse-transcribed.
