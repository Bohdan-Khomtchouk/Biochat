TITLE
MiRNAs expression data from Atm+/+ and Atm-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts after DNA damage at various time point

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atm+/+ and Atm-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with DNA damaging agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), and cells were harvested at indicated time points for the microarray analyses of whole-genome miRNAs.

DESIGN
To examine how miRNAs are regulated in the DNA damage response, we assessed the genome-wide mature miRNA expression in Atm+/+ and Atm-/- littermate mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
