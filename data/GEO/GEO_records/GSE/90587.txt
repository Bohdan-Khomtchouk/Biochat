TITLE
Neuroblastoma response to C2 ceramide and PARP inhibitor (PJ34)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line treated with C2 ceramide, or combination of C2 ceramide and PJ34. Samples were collected in three time points: 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours. Results provide insight into the mechanism of cramide induced cell death and role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in these proces.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y 27 in 2 experimental conditions (cells treated with C2 ceramide or C2 ceramide and PJ34) and the contol sample (pure medium).  For each experimental condition and the control 3 time points (3, 6 and 24 hours) were analysed.  For each variant 3 biological replications were collected.
