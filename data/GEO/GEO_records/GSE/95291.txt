TITLE
Mantle cell lymphoma gene expression profiling array RUL.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains 10 Illumina array spots with a samples of interest from the 12 spot array Illumina HumanHT-12. The following samples was analyzed, all samples were sorted using CD19-microbeads (Miltenyi): -patient´s primary lymphoma cells obtained from leukemized blood (P6-PBMC1, P6-PBMC2) -non-malignant B-cells isolated from peripheral blood of 5 healthy donors (CTRL) -lymphoma cell line designated UPF7U established from the patient´s primary lymphoma cells 166 and 226 days from ex vivo culture (UPF7U-D166, UPF7U-D226) -UPF7U cells isolated ex vivo from from subcutaneously growing murine xenograft (UPF7U-SC) -patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells designated RUL3 established by xenotransplantation of primary lymphoma cells into immunodeficient mice- isolated from the infiltrated murine lymph-node-like tumor (RUL3-LN3) and from subcutaneously growing xenograft (RUL3-SC1, RUL3-SC3) For xenotransplantation, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (referred to as NSG mice) were used.

DESIGN
Unsummarized data can be obtained from https://bitbucket.org/kulvait/klenermicroarraydata package using data(RUL) command.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
