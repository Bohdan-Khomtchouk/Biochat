TITLE
ANTIBIOTICS OVERPRODUCTION IN STREPTOMYCES COELICOLOR A3(2) MEDIATED BY PHOSPHOFRUCTOKINASE A2 DELETION

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of S. coelicolor M145 and the delta_pfkA2 mutant. RNA samples were taken in the early exponential phase during growth in fermentors in defined mineral medium. Keywords: cell type, gene expression, genetic modification

DESIGN
5 Streptomyces ceolicolor Extracts (3 M145 WILD TYPE, 2 M145 Delta_pfkA2 MUTANT) were hybridised with dye swaps on 4 arrays: - Sco8.26 (M145 RNA No. 1 cy5 + M145 delta_pfkA2 RNA No. 1 cy3) - Sco8.28 (M145 delta_pfkA2 RNA No. 2 cy5 + M145 RNA No. 3 cy3) - Sco8.31 (M145 RNA No. 2 cy5 + M145 delta_pfkA2 RNA No. 2 cy3) - Sco8.37 (M145 delta_pfkA2 RNA No. 1 cy5, M145 RNA No. 2 cy3).
