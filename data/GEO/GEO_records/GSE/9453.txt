TITLE
Zea mays B73 stress treatments on UA 70mer oligo slides (Maize oligo array version 1.3 array A and B)

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Maize seedling transcriptome responses to six abiotic perturbations (heat, cold, darkness, desiccation, salt, UV-B) and 2 controls were analyzed Keywords: comparitive transcriptome profiling

DESIGN
Tissues were grown at Stanford University during the summer of 2005.  RNA was extracted and purified, cDNA generated, and amplified cRNA was labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 dyes from 4 biological replicates of each treatment.  Each replicate was composed of a pool of 10 similarly treated whole seedlings (with the endosperm and kernel removed).  Two types of biological controls were employed: 1) seedlings germinated under constant 26ÂºC temperature, with 16 h light and adequate water and 2) field grown juvenile leaf samples   Field seedlings emerged on day 6 or 7.
