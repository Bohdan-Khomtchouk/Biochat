TITLE
Effect of loss of function of Gal11/Med15 and Med3 from the Mediator tail module in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared for wild type yeast (BY4741) and yeast lacking Gal11/Med15 and Med3, or from a gal11-myc med3∆ strain.  The gal11-myc allele shows a partial loss of function when combined with med3∆.  Expression was analyzed for yeast grown in YPD as well as in CSM. We also examined gene expression of the wild type strain BY4742 grown in YPD and include that data here.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared for wild type yeast (BY4741 and BY4742) and yeast lacking Gal11/Med15 and Med3, or from a gal11-myc med3∆ strain.
