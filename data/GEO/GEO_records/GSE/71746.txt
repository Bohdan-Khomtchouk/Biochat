TITLE
Role of GEMC1 controls the MCC transcriptional program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The generation of multiciliated cells requires a highly regulated but poorly understood transcriptional program. The deletion of GEMC1 in mice leads to the loss of multiciliated cells in the brain, respiratory system and oviduct indicating that it plays a key role in this process. We used microarrays to examine the influence of GEMC1 on transcription in tissues with high numbers of multiciliated cells (trachea and oviduct).

DESIGN
The trachea and oviduct were isolated from  wild type and GEMC1 null mice of 39 (trachea, males) or 65 (oviduct, females) days of age. mRNA was extracted for array analysis. IFOM-Cogentech (contributor)
