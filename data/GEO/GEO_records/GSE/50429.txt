TITLE
Deep sequencing of exosomal and cellular miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the miRNAs that are differentially expressed and secreted between the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells and the MCF-10A non-cancerous human mammary epithelial cells, we profiled the cellular and exosomal small RNAs (between 17 and 52 nt) isolated from these two cell lines by Solexa deep sequencing.  MiRNAs that are significantly different between the two cell lines are identified.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from cultured MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A cells or purified exosomes secreted by these cells, and subjected to library construction and Solexa deep sequencing.
