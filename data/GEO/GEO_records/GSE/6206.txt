TITLE
Expression data of untreated or cisplatin-treated wildtype or Rb-/- MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The absence of the Rb tumor suppressor gene changes levels/activities of transcription factors (e.g., E2F and p53) which alter gene expression patterns, related to cell cycle control and cellular response to DNA damage.  Cisplatin is a genotoxic chemotherapeutic agent and wildtype or Rb null cells have different sensitivities to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. We used microarrays to compare global profiles of gene expression and distinct responses of wildtype and Rb null MEFs in response to cisplatin. Keywords: genotype and cisplatin treatment

DESIGN
Primary wildtype or Rb null MEFs were generated from embryos at embryonic day 13.5 and cultured to passage 2.  Wildtype or Rb null MEFs were either untreated or treated with 16 microM cisplatin for 24 hours prior to harvest and RNA extraction.  Four different RNA samples (wildtype or Rb-/- MEFs, untreated or cisplatin-treated) were used for hybridization in triplate to Affimatrix Chips. Then, the total of 12 hybridizations were divided into 4 subseries: UT-Rb, UT-WT, CP-Rb, CP-Wt, and each subseries contained three samples (hybridization 1-3 or a-c).
