TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of WT and SCL28-OX in the Arabidopsis thaliana root tip

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis to identify downstream genes that are transcriptionally regulated by SCL28 (At1g63100)

DESIGN
mRNA samples were prepared from the root tips of 5 d-old WT and SCL28-OX seedlings which were grown in a growth room at 22 â„ƒ under a constant light condition.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
