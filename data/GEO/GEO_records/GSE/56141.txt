TITLE
Expression data from Mesenchymal progenitor cells knocked down for HIF-1a or HIF-2a expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HIF-1a and HIF-2a are expressed at high levels in mesenchymal progenitors compared to more committed mesenchymal cells and hematopoietic cells. HIF-factors could therefore have a role in the regulation the biology of mesenchymal progenitors and their functions, like the non cell-autonomous maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression regulated by HIF-1a or HIF-2a in mesenchymal progenitors

DESIGN
Mesenchymal progenitors were FACS-sorted and cultured in low oxygen concentration for few days. Once cells started to form CFU-F colonies, we transduced them with shRNAs targeting specifically HIF-1a or HIF-2a. Four days after transduction, cells were collected and RNA extracted for microarray analysis.
