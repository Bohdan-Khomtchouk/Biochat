TITLE
Chip-chip from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand how pluripotency is controlled, we employed a modification of standard ChIP-chip method (biotin-mediated ChIP-chip) to identify targets of nine factors, including somatic cell reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) and others (Nanog, Dax1, Rex1, Zpf281, and Nac1) in mouse ES cells. We show the application of In vivo biotinylation mediated ChIP (bioChIP) to global target mapping. Our data also show that differential regulation of target genes correlates with the extent of promoter occupancy by multiple factors in maintaining stem cell pluripotency.
