TITLE
Experiment 4: Klf4, FoxD3, FoxD5 and combined FoxD3 and FoxD5  loss-of-function experiments at 30% epiboly Wild Type zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Morpholino injections were performed to investigate transcriptional targets of Klf4, FoxD3 and FoxD5  in the blastula stage embryos (4,7 hours postfertilization) of wild type zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological duplicates or triplicates. Cy3 and Cy5 channels were splitted in Genedata Analyst software, quantile normalised and used for independent comparisons.

PLATFORM
GPL14664 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Probe Name version)
