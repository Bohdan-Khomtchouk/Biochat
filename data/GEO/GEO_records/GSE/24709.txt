TITLE
Peripheral profiles from patients with cancerous and non cancerous lung diseases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes peripheral miRNA blood profiles of patients with lung diseases. Since miRNAs are known to be valuable diagnostic markers we asked whether respective patterns of lung cancer patients and COPD patients can be detected in peripheral blood samples rather than in biopsies. The project aimed at an impoved understanding of complex profiles rather than single markers. Thus, a high-throughput technique was necessary, profiling all known miRNAs integratively.

DESIGN
n = 19 normal controls, n = 28 lung cancer patients and n = 24 COPD samples have been screened for the complete miRNA repertoire.  Please note that each miRNA has been measured in seven replicates and the median of the replica has been computed.
