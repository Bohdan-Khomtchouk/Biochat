TITLE
Inducible expression of MyoD directly mediates myogenic conversion of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of MyoD-infected DMD-specific iPSCs (GM05112-M5.1) on days 0 (untreated), day 3 and day 8 post Dox treatment, human primary myoblasts (undifferentiated and as differentiated myotubes), and undifferentiated iPSCs from healthy donors (iPSCs-1 and iPSCs-2).

DESIGN
DMD-specific iPSCs were infected with lentivirus expressing MyoD under the control of Tet-inducible promoter and another lentivirus expressing the transactivator. To initiate myogenic differentiation,  iPSCs were treated with 1Âµg/ml Dox. RNA was isolated 0, 3 and 8 days later and gene expression analysis was performed.
