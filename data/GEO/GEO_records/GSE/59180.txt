TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of malignant pleural mesothelioma tumor tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify prognostic microRNAs with differential expression in tumor tissue from long and short survivors of extrapleural pneumonectomy surgery.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from laser-capture microdissected archived FFPE tumor samples from malignant pleural mesothelioma patients. RNA was hybridized on Agilent microRNA microarrays. We sought to identify microRNAs with differential expression between long and short survivors of extrapleural pneumonectomy surgery.
