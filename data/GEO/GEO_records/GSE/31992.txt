TITLE
To determine whether sialyltransferases, sulfotransferases, and/or MUC genes are expressed and if they are induced by PMA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are interested in having the gene microarray done on untreated and PMA treated (10 nM x 24 hr) human and mouse epithelial cells lines including CALU-3, MLE-15, primary bronchial human airway epithelial cells.  We are especially interested in seeing whether sialyl or sulfo transferases, and MUC genes, are present and if they are induced by PMA.  We hope to use this information to optimize future experiments designed to identify Siglec lung ligands.

DESIGN
The lab is interested in studying untreated and PMA treated (10 nM x 24 hr) human and mouse epithelial cells lines including CALU-3, MLE-15, primary bronchial human airway epithelial cells. With special interest in understanding whether sialyl or sulfo transferases, and MUC genes, are present and if they are induced by PMA.
