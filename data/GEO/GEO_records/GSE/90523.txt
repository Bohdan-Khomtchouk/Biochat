TITLE
The long non-coding RNA GAS5 differentially regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the global transcriptional profiles of the neurblastoma cell line IMR-32 48 hours after transfection with a Negative Control siRNA compared to an siRNA for the lncRNA GAS5.

DESIGN
MYCN-amplified Neuroblastoma cells were being examined for the global transcriptional effect of the loss of the lncRNA GAS5 in connection to recognized phenotypes associated with cell cycle control, proliferation, and apoptosis.

PLATFORM
