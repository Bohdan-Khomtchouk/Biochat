TITLE
Genetic analysis of Ikaros target genes and tumor suppressor function in BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed in patient-derived BCR-ABL1+ (Ph+) pre-B ALL cells that harbor heterozygote deletions of the IKZF1 DNA binding domain (Ik6), using cells that inducibly express wild-type Ikaros (Ik1) or an empty vector control.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq from human Ik6+ BCR-ABL1+ pre-B ALL cells following DOX induction of IK1 or empty vector control for the indicated time

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
