TITLE
Gene Expression in Cisplatin Resistance HeLa Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cisplatin resistance is a problem in cancer treatment. Using DNA microarray, we detected differentially expressed genes in cisplatin-resistant cervix carcinoma HeLa cells compared to parental cells.

DESIGN
Three cisplatin resistant cell lines were established by stepwise increasing cisplatin concentration. RNA from these resistant lines and its parental HeLa cells were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. Equal amount of RNA from resistant cell line and HeLa were mixed and were hybridized to cDNA array. Signals were scanned and analyzed to find out the candidate genes involved in cisplatin resistant mechanism.
