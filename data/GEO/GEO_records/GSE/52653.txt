TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation of E2A-PBX1 in the cell line 697

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data from " Direct and indirect targets of the E2A-PBX1 leukemia-specific fusion protein " to be published in PLOS One, authors Christofer Diakos, Yuanyuan Xiao, Shichun Zheng, Leo Kager, Michael Dworzak, Joseph L. Wiemels The experiment showed direct targets of the fusion protein.  In the manuscript, individual gene targets are explained, along with DNA motifs that the fusion protein bound to. Demonstrates the " direct " targets of the E2A-PBX1 leukemia fusion protein, which is a feature of about 5% of all chilldhood leukemia.

DESIGN
Comparison of the ChIP pull-down from E2A antibody in an E2A-PBX1 positive cell line, compared to the input DNA.  There are 3 replicate experiments
