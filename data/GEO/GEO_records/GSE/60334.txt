TITLE
DNA methylation analysis and expression profiling during murine embryogenesis and in embryos deficient for DNMT3A or DNMT3B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We quantified the targets and kinetics of DNA methylation acquisition in mouse embryos, and determined the contribution of the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B to this process. We provide single-base maps of cytosine methylation by RRBS from the blastocysts to post-implantation stages and in embryos lacking DNMT3A or DNMT3B activity, and performed RNA-Seq in embryos lacking DNMT3B activity.

DESIGN
We sequenced RRBS libraries prepared from genomic DNA isolated from embryos at consecutive stages of development between E3.5 and E11.5,and adult differentiated cells (sperm, liver). We performed RRBS on blastocysts at E3.5/E4.5, dissected epiblasts at E5.5/E6.5/E7/5, whole embryos at E8.5/E10.5 and limbs at E11.5. RRBS experiments in Dnmt3a-/- and Dnmt3b-/- embryos were performed in biological duplicates on individual embryos. We sequenced RNA-Seq libraries prepared from total RNAs of three WT and Dnmt3b-/- littermate embryos collected at E8.5.
