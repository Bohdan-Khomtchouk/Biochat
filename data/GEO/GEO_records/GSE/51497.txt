TITLE
Glucocorticoid Receptor and Androgen Receptor DNA binding in LREX'

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LREX' are a LnCAP/AR subline with natural expresison of the glucocorticoid receptor.  We used the model to compare the AR and GR cistromes in prostate tissue.

DESIGN
We determined the GR cistrone in the presence of Dex (100nM) treatment and the AR cistrome in the presene of DHT (1nM) treatment.
