TITLE
AURATUS goldfish environmental genomics projects: fadrozole in the telencephalon

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
Sexually mature female goldfish were exposed (waterborne) to 50 ug/L fadrozole or untreated water (control) to examine the global gene expression of fadrozole on the telencephalon.

DESIGN
A common reference design was used: 5 independent groups of telencephalonic tissue from sexually mature female goldfish exposed to 50 ug/L of waterborne fadrozole were hybridized against a common pool of unexposed fish. Slides 4, 14, 22, 33, 44.
