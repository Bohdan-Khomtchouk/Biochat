TITLE
Estrogen Regulates the JNK1 Genomic Localization Program in Breast Cancer Cells to Control Gene Expression and Cell Growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JNK1 ChIP-chip and ER-alpha ChIP-chip were performed on NimbleGen genomic tiling arrays to understand the genomic binding patterns of this MAP kinase and receptor and their relationship to gene expression.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip analysis of JNK1 occupancy at promoters before and after estrogen treatment. 2 biological replicates (rep1 and rep2, rep3A and rep3B), 2 technical replicates each. ChIP-chip analysis of ER-alpha occupancy at promoters before and after estrogen treatment. 2 biological replicates, 2 technical replicates for one of the replicates (1 and 2).
