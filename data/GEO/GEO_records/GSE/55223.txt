TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisae RNAPII mutant strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major contributor to genome instability. A main cause of transcription-associated instability relies on the capacity of transcription to stall replication. Such genome instability is increased in RNAPII mutants. We performed microarrays to analyze the effect of RNAPII mutations on gene expression. The results indicate there is neither a common profile of gene expression nor genes whose gene expression alterations could reasonably explain the genome instability phenotypes of the RNAPII mutants.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
