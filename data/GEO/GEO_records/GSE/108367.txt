TITLE
IKZF2 is required for myeloid leukemic stem cells by driving self-renewal and inhibiting the myeloid differentiation program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that IKZF2 is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility in leukemic stem cells in myeloid leukemia. RNA seq and ATAC-seq were performed to investigate the changes in chromatin accessibility of differentially expressed genes in leukemic stem cells when IKZF2 was absent. We found that IKZF2 maintains open accessibility in self-renewal transcription factor motifs such as HOXA9 sites whereas motifs of differentiation transcription factors including C/EBPs are kept closed.

DESIGN
4 RNA-seq, 4 ATAC-seq; 2 Ikzf2 WT each, 2 Ikzf2 KO each

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
