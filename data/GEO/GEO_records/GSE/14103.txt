TITLE
Synchronized HTC116 cells: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of synchronized HCT116 cells at various time points up to 10 hours following treatment with DMSO or Nocodazole.

DESIGN
HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in McCOY’S 5A MEDIUM MODIFIED (SIGMA) with 10% FBS (JBS). It was maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Synchronous culture was obtained by incubating cells for 19 h in 2 mM of thymidine, followed by a 9 h-incubation in normal medium and a second 16 h-incubation in thymidine (2 mM). Cells were washed with normal medium followed by treatment with DMSO for 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 h as a control or 0.1 mg/ml Nocodazole (Sigma) for 7, 8, 9 and 10 h.
