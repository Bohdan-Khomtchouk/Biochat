TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with reduced synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the common precursor of all biological synthezised tetrapyrroles. Inhibition of ALA synthesis results in decreased amounts of chlorophylls, heme, siroheme and phytochrome. It was previously shown that 4 out of 5 Arabidopsis mutants uncoupling nuclear gene expression from the physiological state of the chloroplast are affected in plant tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. It is common to all four mutants to show a reduced ALA formation. We investigate the impact of reduced plastidic ALA synthesis on nuclear gene expression by inhibition of ALA formation using gabaculin and compare these effects with  the gun4-1 mutant.

DESIGN
Formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid was inhibited in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seedlings by application of 10 ÂµM gabaculin. Additionally the Arabidopsis gun4-1 mutant was investigated. Seedlings were etiolated for 3 days on MS medium in absence or presence of gabaculin and subsequently deetiolated for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted and used for microarray hybridisation.
