TITLE
The Molecular Mechanism for EZH2 Function in DSS-induced Colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we employed the genetically engineered mice models (GEM) to uncover the role of gut epithelial EZH2 in the pathogenesis of colitis. To dissect the underlying mechanism, Chip-Seq analysis is used for mechanistic study. From the result we find EZH2 mainly targeted in the TSS region. As we have known TNF-alpha pathway can be regulated by EZH2, we try and find TRAF2/5 may be the key point for EZH2 to regulated TNF-alpha pathway. At the same time Bad, BAX, PUMA.etc which promote cell apoptosis can be find in the result, which means EZH2 may inhibit apoptosis of IEC in colitis by targenting these genes.

DESIGN
Wild-type mice were treated with 2% DSS for 3 days and IECs were isolated by EDTA isolation buffer, and each sample contains pooled IECs from 5 mice. Flash frozen cells were then sent to Active Motif, Inc. for chromatin extraction and followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-EZH2 antibody (Active Motif, cat # 39901).
