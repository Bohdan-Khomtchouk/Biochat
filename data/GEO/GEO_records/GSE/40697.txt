TITLE
Studies on the Mechanism of Telavancin Decreased Susceptibility in a Laboratory-Derived Mutant

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide derivative of vancomycin with a dual mode of action. This study sought to understand knowledge of mechanisms of decreased susceptibility in laboratory-derived mutant. There were multiple significant changes in the transcriptome of TlvDSMED1952 indicating an altered overall physiology of the strain, likely decreased virulence, and changes in cell wall and membrane properties, probably due to multiple genetic changes in the strain.

DESIGN
MHB cultures (biological replicates: N=3) were then grown to exponential phase (OD600=0.4). Dye-swapping was performed between samples.

PLATFORM
GPL10591 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 16K v9 array designed primarily based on strain COL
