TITLE
Gene expression data from human induced pluripotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neural stem/progenitor cells, and iPSC-derived cerebral cortical neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and possess the ability to differentiate into numerous lineages during the developmental process. In similarity to embryonic stem cells, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) possess the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages making them an excellent research tool. We generated iPSCs from multiple donors and also differentiated iPSCs from these donors into human neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). We used human transcriptome arrays to detail the programme of gene expression underlying NPC induction and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to create neurons in vitro. This microarray allows researchers to check the expression of their gene of interest in iPSC-derived neurons and compare the gene expression profile of iPSC-derived neurons to other cell types or primary human tissue.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from human induced pluripotent stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells. Their gene expression profiles were investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 platform. Total RNA was extracted from iPSC-derived cerebral cortical neurons and the gene expression profile was investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0
