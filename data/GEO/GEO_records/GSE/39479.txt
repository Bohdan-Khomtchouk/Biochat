TITLE
Transcriptomics of Bacillus thuringiensis Strain CT-43.

ORGANISM
Bacillus thuringiensis

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression and metabolic regulatory mechanisms associated with the high-level accumulation of ICPs by performing the transcriptomics analysis of B. thuringiensis strain CT-43, using Illumina high throughout sequencing (RNA-seq) technique.

DESIGN
The bacterial cells were collected at the time points of 7 h, 9 h, 13 h and 22 h for the whole-genome transcriptomics, respectively.
