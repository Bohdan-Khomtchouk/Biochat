TITLE
Detect circulating miRNA Expression change after exposure to hexavalent chromium (an carcinogen) among occuaptional workers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled plasma miRNA expression in workers exposed to Cr(VI), and assessed genetic damage on chromosome and DNA to compare the sensitivity between epigenetic changes and genetic damage for biomarkers

DESIGN
We screened differently expressed plasma miRNAs between high and low Cr(VI) exposed workers using Agilent miRNA microarray. low exposure : < 5.49 ng/ml; high exposure > 5.49 ng/ml

PLATFORM
GPL16730 Agilent-039659 hs_miR_18_addvirus 038169
