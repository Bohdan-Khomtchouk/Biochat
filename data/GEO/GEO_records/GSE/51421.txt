TITLE
Gene expression profile of hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ cells) with or without nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the the effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating a fluorine contrast agent on hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ fraction of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells), we have employed whole genome microarray expr

DESIGN
The gene expression in human CD34+ cells was measured at 24 h and 7 d after incubation with nanoparticles. Three independent experiments were performed at each time.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
