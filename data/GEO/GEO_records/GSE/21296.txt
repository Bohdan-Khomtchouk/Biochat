TITLE
Expression data of cHL cell lines after KLF4 activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characteristic extinguishing of B-cell phenotype in cHL is believed to be a result of transcription factor network deregulation due to the overexpression of repressor proteins ID2 and ABF-1. KLF4 is a versatile transcription factor, participating in regulation of differentiation processes in various tissues. Epigenetic silencing of KLF4 in cHL hints that KLF4 is involved in the complex mechanism of extinguishing of B-cell phenotype in cHL. To clarify this issue we investigated transcriptome changes, induced by KLF4 activation in two cHL cell lines KM-H2 and L428.

DESIGN
KM-H2-KLF-ER and L428-KLF-ER cells were incubated with 200 µM 4-OHT or vehicle (ethanol). The experiment was done twice. After 24 h, total RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Microarray analyses were performed using 200 ng total RNA as starting material and 5.5 µg ssDNA per hybridization (GeneChip Fluidics Station 450; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The total RNAs were amplified and labeled following the Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay ( http://www.affymetrix.com ). Labeled ssDNA was hybridized to Human Gene 1.0 ST Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The  chips were scanned with a Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and subsequent images analyzed using Affymetrix® Expression Console Software (Affymetrix). Probe level data were obtained using the robust multichip average (RMA) normalization algorithm.
