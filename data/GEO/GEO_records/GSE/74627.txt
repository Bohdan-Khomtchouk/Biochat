TITLE
microRNA study of rectal tissue collected from super-shedders vs cattle negative for E. coli O157:H7

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Total microRNA from rectal tissues of E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000 system. For comparative analysis, differentially expressed microRNAs were identified with edgeR. Two of differentially expressed genes were identified, and one of up-regulated microRNA in super-shedders potentially targets genes related to innate and adaptive immune functions.  The findings indicated that microRNA could play a role in super-shedding phenomenon.

DESIGN
We performed a differential analysis of microRNA expression of rectal tissues collected from E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders, targets prediction for interested microRNAs, and functional analysis for interested microRNAs, to study molecular mechanisms of super-shedding phenomenon.
