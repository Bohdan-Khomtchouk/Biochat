SUMMARY
Murine A20 B cells harboring latent MHV68 were treated with TPA and RNA expression was examined over a 24 hour timecourse experiment.

DESIGN
Study includes 4 samples- an untreated sample and reactivation samples isolated at 6, 12, and 24 hours after treatment of a latent MHV68+ B cell line with TPA.
