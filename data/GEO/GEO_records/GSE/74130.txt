TITLE
microRNA expression of TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant Bel-7402 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further analyze the change of microRNA (miRNA) between TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant Bel-7402 cells Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)

DESIGN
Total RNA from TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant Bel-7402 cells were extracted and analyzed using Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array (7th generation) platform, and changes of miRNA were screened out.The 7th generation of miRNA array contains 3100 capture probes, covering all human, mouse and rat microRNAs annotated in miRBase 18.0, as well as all viral microRNAs related to these species. In addition, this array contains capture probes for 25 miRPlusâ„¢ human microRNAs. These are proprietary microRNAs not found in miRBase.

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
