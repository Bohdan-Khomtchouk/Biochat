TITLE
Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly has been defined as distinct autosomal-recessive syndrome of quasi-static encephalopathy with normo- or microcephaly, impaired psychomotor development and characteristic pattern on brain MRI. We identified mutations in the gene encoding the RNASET2 glycoprotein in seven affected individuals as the cause of disease. The results suggest that RNASET2 plays an important role in central nervous system myelination and development.

DESIGN
2-Color dye swap design independent for two different families including technical and biologial replicates for affected family members (disease) and not affected family members (controls).
