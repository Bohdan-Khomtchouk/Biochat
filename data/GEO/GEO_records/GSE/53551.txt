TITLE
Knockdown of LIVE1 in HUVEC compared to universal negative control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To profile changes in gene expression upon dsiRNA knockdown of LIVE1 lincRNA in HUVECs

DESIGN
HUVECs were either subject to dsiRNA targeting LIVE1 or universal negative control, four distinct biological samples were used paired in each condition,  8 samples all together

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
