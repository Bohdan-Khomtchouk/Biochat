SUMMARY
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common tumors in young men. Fortunately, TGCTs respond very well to cisplatin -based chemotherapy and show a low incidence of acquired resistance compared to most somatic tumors. This high sensitivity also applies to more than 80% of all TGCTs with metastatic disease. The reasons for this particularly high sensitivity of male germ cell tumors to chemotherapy seem to be multifactorial. To study this phenomenon, we have addressed the issue of whether cisplatin produces germ cell tumor specific gene expression profiles using testicular germ cell tumor derived cell lines. By means of microarray technology, we have analyzed cisplatin-induced gene expression in two well characterized human testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) derived cell lines (833K and GCT27) which are sensitive to cisplatin treatment, and in a human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116), to compare responses in germ cell tumor cell lines with those of tumor cells of somatic origin. We further evaluate the male germ cell tumor specificity, by mining available public databases and literature. By using SAM analysis, we identified 1794 differentially expressed genes. Among these, 1180 genes were over-expressed in TGCT cells and under-expressed in HCT116 cells and 614 genes were down-regulated in TGCT cells and up-regulated in HCT116 cells after exposure to cisplatin. Functional classification of these genes showed that they participate in a variety of different and widely distributed functional categories and biochemical pathways.
