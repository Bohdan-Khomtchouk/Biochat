TITLE
Live cell monitoring of periodic gene expression in synchronous human cells identifies forkhead genes involved in cell cycle control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide DNA binding patterns of wild type FOXK1 in asynchronous HeLa cells using chromatin precipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).  We find that FOXK1 is bound to the promoter of a number of cell cycle genes including the E2F binding partner TFDP1.  This study is the first reported study of FOXK1 binding on a genome-wide scale in HeLa cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin precipitation
