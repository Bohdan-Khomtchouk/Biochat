TITLE
Gene expression profiles of NSCLC tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A custom microarray was used to measure the gene expression of NSCLC tumors.  This represents a subset of samples which also have matched DNA copy number profiles from array CGH experiments

DESIGN
49 microdissected NSCLC tumor samples
