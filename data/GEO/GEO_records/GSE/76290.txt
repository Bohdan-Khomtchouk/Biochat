TITLE
Identification of FOSL1 transcriptional targets in mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma cells, H2009, were depleted of FOSL1 by a specific shRNA and its transcriptome was profiled

DESIGN
H2009 cells were infected with lentivirus carrying a FOSL1 or a control (GFP) shRNA for 2 days. Then, cells were selected for 3 days using 5ug/ml puromycin. After that, cells were counted and plated at a density of 600,000 cells/well (6-well plate). RNA was harvested on the following day using Trizol.
