TITLE
Differential gene expression profile of y79 retinoblastoma cells in response to stress conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Y79 retinoblastoma cells were exposed to oxidative stress conditions with hydrogen peroxide exposure. The differential gene expression profile on this condition was evaluated by comparing with untreated control Y79 cells. The cellular responses based on the differential gene expression was studied.
