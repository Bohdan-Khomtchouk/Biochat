TITLE
Gene expression profiles of neonatal cardiomyocytes and immortalized heart muscle cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a transcriptomic approach to systematically compare the response to inflammatory stimuli for two murine cardiomyocyte models. Our results indicate that murine neonatal cardiomyocytes (NNC) are able to exhibit a pronounced response upon inflammatory stimuli, while HL-1 cells were predominantly recruiting transcripts corresponding to Jak-Stat-signalling.

DESIGN
RNA from murine HL-1 cardiomyocytes and isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes (NNC) stimulated by infectious (PCI) serum or LPS or a cytokine mix (CM) were extracted (n=4 each group) and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses.
