TITLE
In vitro and in vivo transcriptional profiling of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was performed on samples taken from (i) chemostat cultures (in vitro) and (ii) from the ceca of gnotobiotic monoassociated NMRI mice (in vivo).  In vitro profiles were obtained from biological duplicate cultures taken at five timepoints from log to stationary phase in three types of media: (i) minimal media glucose (MM-G), (ii) minimal media maltotriose (MM-M), and (iii) rich media (TYG).  In vivo profiling was performed on 12 mice, each colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron for ten days.  The in vivo profiling was conducted in two separate experiments: (i) 6 male NMRI mice fed standard polysaccharide rich mouse chow and (ii) 3 male NMRI mice fed standard polysaccharide rich mouse chow and 3 male NMRI mice fed a simple sugar diet containing glucose and sucrose but deficient in polysaccharides.
