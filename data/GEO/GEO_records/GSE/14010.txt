TITLE
Downregulation of three tumour suppressor genes SLC26A3, DCN and TPM1 in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite identification of major genes and pathways involved in development of colorectal cancer (CRC) it became obvious that several steps in these pathways might be bypassed by other yet unknown genetic events that lead towards CRC. To improve our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of CRC development we used microarrays to identify novel genes involved in development of CRC.
