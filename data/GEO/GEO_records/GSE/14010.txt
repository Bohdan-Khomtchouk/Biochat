TITLE
Downregulation of three tumour suppressor genes SLC26A3, DCN and TPM1 in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite identification of major genes and pathways involved in development of colorectal cancer (CRC) it became obvious that several steps in these pathways might be bypassed by other yet unknown genetic events that lead towards CRC. To improve our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of CRC development we used microarrays to identify novel genes involved in development of CRC.

DESIGN
In order to identify possible novel genes involved in the development of colorectal cancer we analysed the expression profile of 16 colorectal cancers. We used dual color approach. Tumour tissue was labeled with Cy5 and corresponding normal tissue was labeled with Cy3. Each array contained at least 4 replicate spots for each gene analysed. Expression was obtained by calculating median from replicate spots. Genes not present in at least 100% of all samples were filtered out. Median value for each gene from 16 arrays was calculated.
