TITLE
Gene expression in WT, Flt3 KO, and Flt3L KO cDC1s and cDC2s

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine whether there are any gene expression changes in cDC1s and cDC2s from WT, Flt3 KO, or Flt3L KO mice. Specifically whether developing in the absence of Flt3 signaling had any effects on the gene expression of the cDCs

DESIGN
Mature cDC1s and cDC2s were sorted from spleens of WT, Flt3 KO, and Flt3L KO mice, there were two biological replicates for each cell type from each genotype

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
