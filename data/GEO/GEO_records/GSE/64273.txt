TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of Human ES cell line (hESC) derived embryoid body (EB) treated with H3R17methylation inhibitor TBBD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3R17 methylation inhibitor TBBD associated differential gene expression in embryoid bodies was assessed by microarray analysis treated with 10uM TBBD for 48 hours compared to DMSO control treated Ebs

DESIGN
Agilent one-color experiment, Agilent Human miRNA 8x15k Arrays AMADID: 021827 [Agilent miRNA labeling reagent and Hybridization Kit Cat # 5190-0408]
