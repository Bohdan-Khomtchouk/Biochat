TITLE
Retinal gene expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinal gene expression was assessed from postnatal day (P) 8 old low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) knockout mice with a Illumina mouse-WG6 expression BeadChip.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the retinas of P8 Lrp5 knockout and wild type mice (n=3 each group). Total RNA (1ug each) were reverse transcribed, followed by a single in vitro transcription amplification to incorporate biotin-labeled nucleotide, and subsequent hybridization and staining with strepatavidin-Cy3 according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
