TITLE
Analysis of RPE65 loss of function in mouse retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize gene response in RPE65-/- mouse model of Leberâ€™s congenital amaurosis during progression of the disease, we analyzed differential gene expression in retinae early in the development of the disease, namely before and at the onset of photoreceptor cell death in knock-out mice of 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Keywords: knock out response over time

DESIGN
We compared gene expression in wild type and RPE65-/- retinae at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the six conditions analyzed; this series hence contains 18 samples.
