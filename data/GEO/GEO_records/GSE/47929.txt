TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Siglec-14/THP-1 and Siglec-5/THP cell lines, with or without NTHi stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acquisition of a new strain of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is often associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We have previously reported that COPD patients who are homozygous null for SIGLEC14 gene is less susceptible to COPD exacerbation than those who have wild-type allele with functional SIGLEC14 gene. In order to gain insight into the mechanism behind the COPD exacerbation, and to find new clues that may lead to the discovery of objective biomarker of COPD exacerbation, Siglec-14/THP-1 and Siglec-5/THP-1 cell lines, which mimic monocytes from homozygous wild-type and homozygous SIGLEC14-null person, respectively, were incubated with or without NTHi, and their gene expression profiles were compared by using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

DESIGN
Four samples (2 cell lines x 2 conditions) were analyzed. No replicates were made.
