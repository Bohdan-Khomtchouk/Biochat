TITLE
Expression profiling of differentiating emerin-null myogenic progenitor identifies molecular pathways implicated in their impaired differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was performed on proliferating and differentiating wildtype and emerin-null myogenic progenitors to identify molecular pathways implicated in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 2 million wildtype or emerin-null H2Ks during proliferation and at each day of differentiation using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, product #217004) and processed according to manufacturerâ€™s protocol. RNA was isolated from three independent cell culture plates for each sample.
