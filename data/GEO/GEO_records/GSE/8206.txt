TITLE
Tomato response to TMV after 1h of infection

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
TMV-resistant, TMV-susceptible and enhanced susceptibility mutant tomato were grown in asceptic conditions.  At approximately 5 weeks, leaves were mock inoculated, TMV inoculated, or left untreated.  Leaf tissue was collected 1hour after treatment.  RNA was isolated and purified; hybridizations were performed using 130ug of total RNA from plants mock inoculated versus TMV inoculated and untreated.  Each RNA sample is from two pooled plants.  Two replicates were completed. Keywords: Direct comparison

DESIGN
12 hybs total

PLATFORM
GPL1901 Potato 10k cDNA array version 2
