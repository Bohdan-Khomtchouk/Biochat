TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of human iPSC-derived Neural Stem Cells (NSC) from LCA patients and unaffected persons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our purpose was to investigate genes and molecular mechanisms involved in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Fibroblasts from two unrelated clinically-identified patients (Coriell) were reprogrammed to pluripotency by retroviral transduction. These human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSC) that mimicked the neural tube stage and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells that could be targeted by the disease. A genome wide transcriptome analysis was performed with Affymetrix Exon Array GeneChipÂ®, comparing LCA-hiPSCs derivatives to controls. The aim was to identify differentially expressed genes which may be associated with early developmental defect before the establishment of mature retinal circuitry.

DESIGN
We analyzed iPSC-derived neural stem cells from LCA patient's fibroblast (n=2) and iPSC-derived neural stem cells from healthy people fibroblast (n=2). A total of 21 samples were analyzed : 9 NSC derived from iPSC LCA and 12 NSC derived from wild-type iPSC.
