TITLE
Early dynamics of ERa and GRHL2 binding on stimulation with estradiol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured ER binding by ChIP-Seq at three time-points (0, 45, 90 minutes after activation with E2) and overlaid the binding information on a co-expression network. Our approach, called VULCAN, rediscovered many known components of the ER complex and additionally found that the activation ER results in the reprogramming of the transcriptional role of the GRHL2 cofactor.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data in MCF7 at three time-points for ERa and two time points for GRHL2 after stimulation with 100 nM E2

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
