TITLE
Illumina Bead expression array data from Human IgE+ and IgG+ B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human in-vitro differentiated IgE+ and IgG+ Germinal Centre B cells, plasma blasts and plasma cells were isolated by flow cytometry and subjected to transcriptome analysis using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array platform.  B cells derived from 4 donors are submitted for each cell population.

DESIGN
Total B  cells were isolated from discarded tonsillar tissue from 4 donors following routine tonsillectomy (following informed consent) and cultured for 10 days in the presence of IL-4 and anti-CD40 stimulation. After 10 days IgE+ and IgG+ germinal centre, plasma blast or plasma cells were isolated  by flow cytometry and total RNA extracted. RNA was then reverse transcribed, amplified and biotin labelled prior to profiling on Illumina Human HT-12 v4 expression arrays.
