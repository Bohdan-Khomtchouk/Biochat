SUMMARY
Calibration array used to assess probe specific binding behaviour across eight different amounts of DNA starting material. This calibration step was performed to select one best out of three probes per gene based on probe responsiveness on increasing DNA staring material. It was further used to calibrate a subsequent microarray experiment to account for probe specific binding behaviour as part of the normalization process (see also Dennenmoser et al. 2017 Copy number increases of transposable elements and protein coding genes in an invasive fish of hybrid origin).
