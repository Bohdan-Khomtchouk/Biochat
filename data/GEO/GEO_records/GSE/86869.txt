TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene transcripts during callus formation  from the basal part of young rice leaf explants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism that confers the ability to regenerate on certain tissues in rice, we performed an RNA-seq experiment during callus formation from the basal part of young leaf explants about 7 mm in length.The 1727 genes are significantly highly upregulated in 2 DAC and 1839 genes in 5 DAC on Callus Induced Medium as compared to that of 0 DAC based on the following criteria: fc > 10 and P value < 0.05.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the base regionï¼ˆ2 mm) of 7 mm rice leaf explants at time 0, 2 DAC and 5 DAC on Callus Induced Medium.

PLATFORM
GPL13834 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa Japonica Group)
