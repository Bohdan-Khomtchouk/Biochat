TITLE
N-Tera2 differentiated human neuronal model: Mock infected vs HCoV-OC43 infected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of N-Tera2 differentiated human neuronal cells, comparing control uninfected cells to HCoV-OC43 infected cells at 24, 48 and 72 hour post-infection Keywords: Cell response to viral infection

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, N-Tera2 differentiated human neuronal cell mock infected vs. N-Tera2 differentiated human neuronal cell HCoV-OC43 infected at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Biological replicates: 2 at each time-course point. Technical replicate: 2 dye-swap at each time-point. 2 arrays hybridized with mock(cy3) vs infected(cy5) and 2 array with infected(cy3) vs mock(cy5).

PLATFORM
GPL7264 Agilent-012097 Human 1A Microarray (V2) G4110B (Probe Name version)
