TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of HCT116 cells after PBS, 5-Aza-CdR, vitamin C and combination treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomide DNA methylation profiling of HCT116 cells after PBS, 5-Aza-CdR, vitamin C and combination treatment.  The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs in HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
