TITLE
ME31B/DDX6 globally represses maternal mRNAs by two distinct mechanisms during the Drosophila maternal-to-zygotic transition

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Using RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, we found that ME31B binding represses expression of thousands of genes in the Drosophila early embryo, but the mechanism by which ME31B acts changes: before the maternal-to-zygotic transition, ME31B represses translation, while afterwards, it stimulates mRNA decay.

DESIGN
RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing was performed for PABP and ME31B in S2 cells, and in the early embryo (0-5 hours for w1118, eGFP-me31B; 0-1 and 2-3 hours for png50; 0-1 hours for eGFP-me31B;png50 flies )
