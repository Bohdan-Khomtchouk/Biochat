TITLE
Expression of oxysterol pathway genes in estrogen positive breast carcinomas-second phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metabolism of anticancer drugs markedly affects their antitumor effects. The major goal of our study was to investigate associations of gene expression of enzymes metabolizing taxanes and/or anthracyclines with therapy response and survival of breast carcinoma patients The present study investigated transcript levels of key modulators of oxysterol signaling pathway, including oxysterol receptors, metabolic enzymes and transporters in the group of hormone-receptor positive breast carcinoma patients to evaluated potential clinical significance of these genes.

DESIGN
Transcript levels of twenty-five selected human genes (oxysterol signaling pathway, oxysterol receptors, metabolic enzymes and transporters) were determined by qPCR in tumor tissue samples from 164 breast carcinoma patients treated by antihormone therapy or antihormone therapy and chemotherapy. EIF2B1, ELF1, and UBB were used as reference genes for data normalization.
