TITLE
MicroRNA profiling shows different response to retinoids in estrogen-receptor positive and negative cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This Series reports results of miRNA profiling of estrogen-receptor-positive (MCF7) and estrogen-receptor-negative (MDA-MB-231) cells. Retinoic Acid (RA) induces mir-21 in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated (or not) with retinoic acid (RA) and grown for either 6 hours or 48 hours.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling: Factorial design 2x2x2 'cube'; main factors: RA, cells, time; interactions: RA.cells, RA.time, cells.time, RA.cells.time.

PLATFORM
GPL9472 Adelaide microarray facility Exiqon LNA miRNA microarray_version8.1
