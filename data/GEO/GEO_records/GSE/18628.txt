TITLE
MicroRNA profiling shows different response to retinoids in estrogen-receptor positive and negative cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This Series reports results of miRNA profiling of estrogen-receptor-positive (MCF7) and estrogen-receptor-negative (MDA-MB-231) cells. Retinoic Acid (RA) induces mir-21 in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated (or not) with retinoic acid (RA) and grown for either 6 hours or 48 hours.
