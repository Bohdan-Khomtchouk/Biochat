Microarray analysis of xenograft models in use at the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (DTP-NCI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Xenograft models remain a cornerstone technology in the development of anti-cancer agents. The ability of immunocompromised rodents to support the growth of human tumors provides an invaluable transition between in vitro testing and clinical trials. Therefore, approaches to improve model selection are required. In this study, cDNA microarray data was generated for a collection of xenograft models at in vivo passages 1, 4 and 10 (P1, P4 and P10) along with originating cell lines (P0). These data can be mined to determine transcript expression 1) relative to other models 2) with successive in vivo passage and 3) during the in vitro (P0) to in vivo (P1) transition.

DESIGN
For originating cell lines (P0) and xenograft fragments at P1, P4 and P10, RNA was isolated, cDNA transcribed and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. P0 samples have 2-3 replicates, whereas P1, P4 and P10 samples have 5 replicates. This dataset comprises a total of 823 array files.
