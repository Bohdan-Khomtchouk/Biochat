TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in ALK inhibitor CH5424802-treated NCI-H2228 xenograft tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the downstream signal pathway of EML4-ALK in NSCLC, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip analysis using ALK inhibitor CH5424802-treated NCI-H2228 xenograft tumors, and comprehensively characterized the gene expression regulated by inhibition of activated ALK.
