TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in ALK inhibitor CH5424802-treated NCI-H2228 xenograft tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the downstream signal pathway of EML4-ALK in NSCLC, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip analysis using ALK inhibitor CH5424802-treated NCI-H2228 xenograft tumors, and comprehensively characterized the gene expression regulated by inhibition of activated ALK.

DESIGN
Mice bearing NCI-H2228 cells were orally administered at dose of 0 (vehicle), 4 or 20 mg/kg of CH5424802, and the tumors were collected and lysed at 6 hours post-dose. Total RNA were extracted from xenograft tumors.
