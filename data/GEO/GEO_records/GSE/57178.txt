TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lesions of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) showed significant up-regulation of 506 genes and reduced expression of 51 genes.

DESIGN
We enrolled 8 patients with CIU and 6 healthy controls and obtained 4mm punch biopsies of active lesions and unaffected skin of patients with CIU and of skin from normal controls. Routine histologic evaluation was performed, RNA was isolated and gene expression data was determined using an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (www.affymetrix.com). Due to technical reasons, the final evaluation included 6 samples of lesional skin, 7 samples of non-lesional skin and 5 samples of normal skin.
