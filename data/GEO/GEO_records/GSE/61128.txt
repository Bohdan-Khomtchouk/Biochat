TITLE
Expression data from aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) and myofibroblasts (FB) isolated respectively from the ascending aortas and the aortic valves of bicuspid (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AoSMC and FB were cultured and exposed to transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFb1) prior to the exon array analysis The objective was to study the TGFb responsivness, at the gene expression level, in AoSMC and FB form BAV and TAV patients

DESIGN
54 samples in total were generated from biopsies obtained from 23 different individuals. We performed paired analyses to compare the un-treated (c) versus the TGFb1 (t1) treated cells, for each patient
