TITLE
Expression profile of TTHB099-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to find function of TTHB099 protein from T. thermophilus HB8, we observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the TTHB099-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70°C for 360 and 420 min.

DESIGN
Four TTHB099-deficient T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 360 or 420 min, respectively, and then, the expression of each mRNA was analyzed.
