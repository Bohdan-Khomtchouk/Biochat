TITLE
Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HPcpxA gene expression relative to 35000HP

ORGANISM
[Haemophilus] ducreyi

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of the global gene expression of a Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP cpxA deletion mutant relative to the wild type strain

DESIGN
After the cpxA mutant was generated, both strain were grown in Columbia Broth.  After 8 hr of growth RNA wa isolated and processed for DNA microarray analysis.  This study includes three biological replicates (paired samples), and all three were subjected to dye swap.
