TITLE
Epigenome analysis of leukemia stem, blast and normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of leukemia stem, blast cells obtained from 15 AML patients and of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from 5 normal bone marrow. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in the samples. Samples included 20 leukemia stem cells, 24 blast cells and 30 normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (6 different types from 5 normal bone marrows).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 74 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
