TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of the human periodontal ligament and dental pulp in the human permanent teeth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The periodontal ligament(PDL) and dental pulp tissues of human permanent teeth have a number of differences in their developmental processes, histological characteristics and functions. It can be figured out that these differences are attributable to genetic backgrounds of their cells organized tissues. The purpose of this study was to identify the gene-expression profiles and their molecular biological differences of periodontal ligament and dental pulp tissues from the human permanent teeth.

DESIGN
PDL and pulp samples were obtained from healthy persons. Total RNA from the PDL and the pulp tissues were used to cDNA microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
