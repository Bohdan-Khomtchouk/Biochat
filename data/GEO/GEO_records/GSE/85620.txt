TITLE
The Effects of Regular Post-Exercise Cold Water Immersion on Gene Expression in Muscle Following 10-weeks of Strength Training

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, the primary objective was to characterise the impact of regular post-exercise (20 strength training sessions across 10 weeks) cold-water immersion (CWI) on mRNA expression.  Secondary to this, the effect of regular post-exercise CWI on strength gains and post-exercise soreness was investigated. We used microarrays to detail the global effects of CWI on gene expression in vastus lateralis muscle tissue.

DESIGN
Healthy, trained road cyclists (mean ± SD; age 30 ± 8 years; height 181.5 ± 7.8 cm; mass 79.6 ± 11.3 kg) were enrolled in the study.  Participants were randomly and equally divided into two groups, one that utilised CWI as a recovery strategy and another which received a sham placebo recovery drink.
