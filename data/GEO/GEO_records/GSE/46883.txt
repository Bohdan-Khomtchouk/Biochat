TITLE
Nucleotide-resolution, genome-wide transcriptome maps of Propionibacterium acnes (cultured with and without potassium downshift)

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202

SUMMARY
This data contained within this entry was produced as part of a study that included differential RNA-sequencing and microarray analysis.  The results of the latter two have also been deposited in GEO

DESIGN
Duplicate cultures of Propionibacterium acnes strain KPA171202 were grown exponentially in Holland Synthetic Medium (Holland et al.1979. J Appl Bacteriol 47: 383), which supports reproducible anaerobic growth. Samples were taken following subculture with and without potassium downshift (i.e. removal from medium).
