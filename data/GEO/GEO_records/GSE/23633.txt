TITLE
Array comparative genomic hybridization data from RCC cell lines to study metastasis progression

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
This study investigates the molecular signatures that drive Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) metastatic conversion using the metastatic (LM2) and non-metastatic (SN12C) RCC cell lines.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, RCC Cell lines vs. Reference human genome DNA from normal male.
