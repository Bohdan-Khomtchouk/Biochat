TITLE
Differential Expression of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Patients with Tuberculosis Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The differential expression of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the sputa from patients with Tuberculosis (TB) as (TB positive), community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthy individuals (CG) using lncRNA microarray scanning were evaluated. It was found that there were 2116 specific lncRNAs differentially expressed in the TB positive samples (1102 up-regulated and 1014 down-regulated), which accounted for 6.96% of total lncRNAs.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, plasma samples from patients diagnosed as TB positive by sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture, patients with CAP and healthy subjects for reference control in Zhuhai Center for Chronic Disease Control during the period from October, 2014 to November, 2015 were collected.
