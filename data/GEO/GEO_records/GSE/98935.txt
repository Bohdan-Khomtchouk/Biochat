TITLE
ALG-5 is a miRNA-associated Argonaute required for proper developmental timing in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Caenorhabditis elegans contains twenty-five Argonautes, of which, only ALG-1 and ALG-2 are known to interact with miRNAs. ALG-5 belongs to the AGO subfamily of Argonautes that includes ALG-1 and ALG-2, but its role in small RNA pathways is unknown. We analyzed by high-throughput sequencing the small RNAs associated with ALG-5, ALG-1, and ALG-2, as well as changes in mRNA expression in alg-5, alg-1, and alg-2 mutants.

DESIGN
We analyzed by high-throughput sequencing miRNA-Argonaute interactions in C. elegans and their impact on mRNA levels. The data in this series includes mRNA sequencing of loss-of-function mutants, small RNA sequencing of loss-of-function mutants, and sequencing of small RNAs that co-immunoprecipitate with each Argonaute protein.
