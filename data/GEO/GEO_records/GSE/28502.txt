TITLE
Expression data for HUVSMC treated with Triptolide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of mRNA in mammalian is mainly performed by RNA polymerase II (PolII). POLRMT is responsible for the production of cytoplasmic and nuclear form of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The former (mtRNAP) participates in transcription of RNA in the mitochondria while the latter (spRNAP-IV) is responsible for some mRNA transcription in the nucleus. The nature and amount of genes transcribed by spRNAP-IV still remains unclear. Thus, we scanned for possible candidate genes by using Affymetrix.

DESIGN
HUVSMC cell line was treated with or without 0.3 uM of Triptolide (an inhibitor of PolII) for 24 hours to determine which genes are insensitive to triptolide treatment.
