TITLE
Profiling of transcripts in developing seeds of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lines differing in major storage proteins

ORGANISM
Phaseolus vulgaris

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular basis for differences of common bean wild-type and mutant in sulphur amino acid content, transcripts were profiled at four developmental stages of seeds from wild-type SARC1 and major seed storage protein-deficient line SMARC1N-PN1 using a CustomArray 90K array. Microarray data confirmed that transcripts of storage and sulphur-rich proteins and sulphur-metabolism related genes were differentially expressed between the lines.

DESIGN
The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) mutant line, SMARC1N-PN1 and its wild type, SARC1 used in the  microarray  experiment were grown in the field in London, ON, in 2009. Four developmental stages of seeds, based on fresh seed weight, were harvested. The stages of seeds used are Stage IV – cotyledon, 25 mg seed weight; Stage V – cotyledon, 50 mg seed weight; Stage VI – maturation, 150 mg seed weight, corresponding to the most active phase of reserve accumulation; and Stage VIII – maturation, 380 mg seed weight, corresponding to the onset of desiccation, were harvested for total RNA extraction. Four biological replicates for  Stage IV and V and 3 biological replicates for Stage VI and VIII.
