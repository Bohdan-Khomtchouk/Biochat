TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of United Kingdom Ovarian Cancer Population Study (UKOPS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in whole blood samples from 540 samples, of which 266 were samples taken from postmenopausal women with ovarian cancer and 274 were from age-matched healthy controls Keywords: DNA methylation

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 540 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
