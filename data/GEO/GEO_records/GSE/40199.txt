TITLE
Whole Genome sequencing of a normal karyotype AML cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal Karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) represents approximately 50% of all cases of AML which patients develop.  Most AML cell lines are highly abnormal and therefore not good models for investigating NK-AML biology a novel AML cell line, CG-SH, was recently estabished and here we characterize the gene expression and mutations present through high-throughput sequencing of RNA and genomic DNA using a HiSeq 2000

DESIGN
The overall design of the experiment was to characterize, at single base pair resolution, all of the genetic defects present in a novel normal karyotype cell line, CG-SH

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
