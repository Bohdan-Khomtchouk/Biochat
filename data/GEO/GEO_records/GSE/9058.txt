TITLE
Gene expression in the human VTA of cases with alcohol abuse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Drugs of abuse including nicotine and alcohol elicit their effect by stimulating the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system.  There is a high incidence of nicotine dependence in alcoholics.  To date only limited data is available on the molecular mechanism underlying the action of alcohol and nicotine in the human brain.  This study utilised gene expression screening to identify genes sensitive to chronic alcohol abuse within the ventral tegmental area of the human brain. Keywords: gene expression, brain, alcohol abuse, human, ventral tegmental area
