TITLE
Effects of IFITM1 knockdown in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) is one of the three members of the interferon-induced transmembrane family and has recently been identified as a new molecular marker in human colorectal cancer. However, its functional roles in colorectal cancer are still elusive. In this study, we investigate the gene expression profiling of HT-29 cells with IFITM1 knockdown. We revealed that several invasive- and carcinogenesis-related genes were differentially expressed.

DESIGN
We transfected siRNAs targeting firefly luciferase and human IFITM1 mRNAs into HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. At 72 h post-transfection, total RNA was harvested for microarray hybridization. A siLuc-transfected sample was used as the baseline control.
