TITLE
Gene expression in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mouse bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question. We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a separation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from HSC EGFP-, HSC EGFP+, LMPP, CLP, preGM EGFP-, preGM EGFP+, GMP EGFP-, GMP EGFP+ and preMegE cells with the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit.
