TITLE
Role of estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRa) in CD4+ T cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ERRa is an orphan nuclear receptor with an established role in cell metabolism. Our studies demonstrate that acute or chronic loss of ERRa broadly affects mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism in CD4+ T cells and results in diminished T cell function and differentation. In this array, we assessed the contribution of ERRa to changes in gene expression in resting and stimulated CD4+ T cells with the goal of identifying specific metabolic genes that exhibit altered expression in the presence or absence of ERRa. Please see related publication: Michalek, et al. PNAS 2011.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells from 6-8 week old mice were negatively selected (Miltenyi), resulting in > 95% purity and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products). Wild-type (WT) and ERRa−/− (ERRKO) CD4+ T cells were harvested directly ex vivo or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 12 h in the presence or absence of the pharmacological inhibtors of ERRa XCT790 and Compound A. RNA was harvested using the RNeasy Plus kit from Qiagen.The microarray was prepared and analyzed by the Duke Microarray Facility using Ambion Message Amp Premier labeling and Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0. Each assay contains three independent biologic replicates.
