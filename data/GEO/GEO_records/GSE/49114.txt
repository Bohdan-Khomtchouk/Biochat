TITLE
Murine Schistosoma-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension: RNA-seq Data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole lung RNA-seq of 8 mice with experimental Schistosoma-induced pulmonary hypertension, compared to 8 control mice. All mice on a C57Bl6/J background. 3 schisto-PH and 3 control mice (#s 1-3 in each group) were also processed by Affy microarray and separately submitted. 3 of the mice in each group (labeled 1D11) were also treated with the pan-TGF-beta neutralizing antibody 1D11. Illumina HiSeq 2000 used. Data published in: Protective Role of IL6 in Vascular Remodeling in Schistosoma-Pulmonary Hypertension.

DESIGN
Whole lung transcriptome of 8 mice with experimental Schistosoma-induced pulmonary hypertension, compared to 8 control mice. All mice on a C57Bl6/J background.
