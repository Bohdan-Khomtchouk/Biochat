TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation maps of histone deacetylase inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of DNA methylation changes after prolonged exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines to low doses of Panobinostat (LBH589), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation BeadChip to generate genome-wide DNA methylation maps of  triple-negative cell lines cell types after histone deacetylase inhibition.
