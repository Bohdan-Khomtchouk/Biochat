TITLE
Determining the Program of Leydig Cell Development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study, microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated from purified SLCs, PLCs, ILCs, ALCs and bone stem cells, using Affymetrix Rat Genome RAE230 2.0 arrays which monitor ~30,000 transcripts from over ~28,000 well-substantiated genes.  The focus is on the differences and similarities between SLCs and bone stem cells, and between SLCs and PLCs, ILCs and ALCs

DESIGN
3-4 replicas of leydig cells from different developmental stages were collected and analyzed
