TITLE
TGFbeta lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The response to a 4 hour treatment with TGFbeta (4 ng/ml) was evaluated in lung fibroblasts derived from three controls (normal periphery of resected tumor), open lung biopsies from three patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on biopsy) and from three patients with fibrosing alveolitis associated with systemic sclerosis (fibrotic non specific interstitial pneumonia pattern on biopsy). Lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. At confluence, lung fibroblasts were serum-deprived overnight, and exposed to either 4 ng/ml of activated TGF-ÃŸ1 (R & D Systems) or serum-free culture medium with 0.1% BSA for four hours.
