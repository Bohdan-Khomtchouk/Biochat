TITLE
Differential miRNAs between Sensitive and Resistant Pig to Escherichia coli F18 by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
An M307 G/A point mutation of FUT1 gene has been considered as a usful marker to select the piglets that are sensitive(GG/AG genotype) or resistant(AA) to Escherichia coli F18 in foreign pig breeds. However,it is not suitable to Chinese native breeds. Duodenal tissues were collected from 3 full-sib pairs of Sutai pigs (a new hybrid between the Duroc and Taihu breeds) at the age of 28-day differing in adhesion phenotype to find the differential miRNAs that can  provide the basis for analyzing the different mechanisms of E.coli F18 resistance between foreign and Chinese native breeds,as well as for breeding for disease resistance in Chinese native breeds in the future.

DESIGN
piglets at the age of 28-day sensitive(GG genotype) to Escherichia coli F18  vs resistant(AA) ones.Biological replicates:3 full-sib pairs of Sutai pigs(3 pairs for GG/AA genotype of FUT1 gene).One GG sample (512 piglet) was sequenced twice to verify the result. 2385 piglet and 2383 piglet were a pair of full-sib with AA and GG genotype at M307 positionof FUT1 gene, respectively. Unfortunately, the sequencing of 2385 was a failure and was excluded. 2385 piglet has an AA genotype of the FUT1 gene
