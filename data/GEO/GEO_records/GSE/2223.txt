TITLE
Gene expression profiling in human glial brain tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in 50 glial brain tumors and 4 normal brains using 42,000-feature cDNA microarrays (from total RNA). Tumors: 50 fresh-frozen glioma specimens subjected to standard WHO classification. Specimens included astrocytic [2 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 low-grade astrocytic glioma, 1 anaplastic astrocytomas, 31 glioblastomas (of these 2 secondary glioblastomas and 2 gliosarcomas)], oligodendroglial [5 oligodendrogliomas, 3 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas], and 6 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas tumors. One tumor had been classified as glioneuronal neoplasm. Normal brain was purchased from Stratagene. Stratagene Universal Common Reference was used as reference RNA. The results provide insights into molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with gliomagenesis. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. type: Logical Set Keywords: other
