TITLE
Differential expression of stem cell-specific genes in P7 and P28 dentate gyrus neural progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify cell-autonomous factors that might be regulating the neurogenic niche, type 1 and 2 progenitors were FACS sorted from P7 and P28 animals and their cDNA was hybridized to a stem cell-specific microarray. Keywords: differential gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Two samples per microarray (P7 and P28).  Each microarray experiment was done in triplicate. P7 is the control sample.
