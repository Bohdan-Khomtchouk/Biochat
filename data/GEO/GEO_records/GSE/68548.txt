TITLE
The gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infants (6 to 11 months) immunized with an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the gene expression after administrating an inactivated EV71 vaccine, we have employed whole human genome microarray expression profiling to emphasize the gene expression profile of the immune system in response to an inactivated EV71 vaccine in humans and confirmed that such an immune response was generated as the result of the positive mobilization of the immune system. Human peripheral blood from this vaccine or placebo was isolated, extracted the RNA and screened by microarray. The results showed significantly greater neutralizing antibody and specific T cell responses in vaccine group after two inoculations on days 0 and 28. Additionally, more than 600 functional genes that were up- or down-regulated in PBMCs were identified by the microarray assay, and these genes included 68 genes associated with the immune response in vaccine group.

DESIGN
The vaccine inoculation group and the placebo control group, originated from the cohort of phase II clinical trial, consisted of 20 subjects (aged from 6-11 months, average: 9.6 months). The trial was randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled, and all of the parents or guardians of the subjects were required to sign an informed consent explaining the experiment.
