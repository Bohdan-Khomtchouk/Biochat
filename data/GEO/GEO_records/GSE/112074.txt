TITLE
Inhibitors of LSD1 target demethylase-independent activity to induce differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia [anti-H3K9 ac, anti-H3K27, RCOR1, SPI1, and MLL4 ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether changes in histone modifications directly correlate with changes in transcription, THP1 AML cells were treated with a potent and selective LSD1 inhibitor (OG86, 250nM) and then subjected to concomitant RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and ChIP sequencing (ChIPseq) for histone acetylation modifications, RCOR1, SPI1 and MLL4.

DESIGN
THP1 AML cells were treated with 250nM OG86 or DMSO vehicle for 24 hours in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
