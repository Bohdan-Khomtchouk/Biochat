TITLE
Expression data from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells exposed to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Elevated reactive oxidative species (ROS) may be crucial for cellular transformation and tumor progression. Defining the response of stem cells to ROS is critical to understanding the unique sensitivity of stem cells to ROS-mediated transformation and tumor initiation. We examined both the immediate transcriptional and phospho-proteomic responses of murine ES cells induced by a single brief dose of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to create a more complete understanding of cell response to ROS.

DESIGN
Murine ES cells were briefly exposed to low and high dose of H2O2 then allowed to recover for 1 hour in maintenance medium before RNA extraction and MG_U74Av2 microarray hybridization.
