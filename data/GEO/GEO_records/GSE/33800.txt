TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Triclosan on Mycobacterium bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis BCG

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of Mycobacterium bovis BCG following Triclosan treatment using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Results from this study provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response of Mycobacterium bovis BCG to Triclosan

DESIGN
We conducted three independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of triclosan. Fold change was calculated as a ration between the signal averages of three untreated (control) and three triclosan-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 10 and 60min exposures.
