TITLE
Normal, sluggish and recovered fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of time course experiment of [1] a synthetic must (nitrogen-rich) fermentation by a natural wine yeast; [2] a synthetic must (nitrogen-poor) fermentation by a natural wine yeast; and [3] a synthetic must (nitrogen-poor) fermentation by a natural wine yeast, supplemented at 72 hours with 200 mg/l of nitrogen. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series, and to genomic hybridization of the individual membranes used for normalizing single samples.
