TITLE
Genome-wide Promoter Mapping of Histone H3 Lysine 4 and Lysine 27 Methylation in Preimplantation Embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
First lineage specification in the mammalian blastocyst embryo leads to formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE), which respectively give rise to the embryo proper and extraembryonic tissues. We show histone methylation asymmetry on promoters in the first two developmental lineages, and highlight epigenetic skewing associated with derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of histone methylation patterns on promoters in the ICM, TE and in ES cells derived from ICM. ChIP-chip experiments using anti-H3K4me3 or anti-H3K27me3 antibodies. Two or three replicates per sample.
