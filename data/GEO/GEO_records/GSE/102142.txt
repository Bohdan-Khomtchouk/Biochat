TITLE
Ectopic expression of the Brachyury transcription factor upregulates only a subset of notochord expressed genes

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
The key notochord transcription factor Brachyury was ectopically expressed in Ciona embryos under the control of the FoxAa cis-regulatory region (which drives expression in neural, endodermal and mesenchymal lineages in addition to notochord). Misexpression of Brachyury induced 925 genes compared to a control reporter plasmid (Bra > GFP). There was only modest overlap with a set of notochord-enriched genes previously identified by RNAseq of flow-sorted notochord cells, indicating that Brachyury is not a notochord master regulator gene as strictly defined.

DESIGN
Fertilized dechorionated eggs were electroporated with either FoxAa > Venus-Bra plasmid or control plasmid (Bra < GFP). For each of the replicates, 400 experimental and 400 control embryos were collected at stage 19.5 (7.5hpf at 21.5C). Triple biological replicates of purified RNA were analyzed by RNAseq and transcript enrichment was calculated using the Cufflinks software suite
