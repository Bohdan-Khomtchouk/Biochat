TITLE
megamiR, microRNA expression profiles during megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This collection contains microRNA expression profiling data for samples purified from umbilical cord blood, belonging to one of the followiing populations: MEP, MEGA1, MEGA2, ERY1, ERY2, ERY3. MEP: megakaryocyte-erythrocyte precursors (defined by CD34+ CD38+ IL-3Ra- CD45RA- ); MEGA1: megakaryocyte population 1 (defined by CD34+ CD61+ CD41+ CD45- ); MEGA2: megakaryocyte population 2 (defined by CD34- CD61+ CD41+ CD45- ); ERY1: erythrocyte population 1 (defined by CD34+ CD71+ GlyA- ); ERY2: erythrocyte population 2 (defined by CD34- CD71+ GlyA- ); ERY3: erythrocyte population 3 (defined by CD34- CD71+ GlyA+ ). Keywords: microRNA, miRNA, MEP, megakaryocyte, erythrocyte, lineage specification

DESIGN
Varied numbers of samples were analyzed per population. Each sample came from one donor. Data were normalized as described (Lu et al., Nature 435, 834-838, 2005) with modifications. Average readings from water-only labeled samples were used for probe-specific background subtraction. Linear normalization among different bead sets for the same sample was performed using readings from 2 post-control probes with equal contribution. Sample normalization was subsequently carried out assuming equal total fluorescence readings.
