TITLE
Intracellular transcriptional adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) clinical isolates inside activated murine macrophages

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
This study uses microarray analyses to examine transcriptional responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates to phagosomal cues encountered inside activated (IFN-gamma+LPS) murine bone marrow-derived macrophages 24hr post-infection. Transcript levels of intracellular mycobacteria were compared to extracellular bacteria of the same strain (An aliquot of the inoculum used to infect macrophages was incubated in the absence of macrophages for 24hr in an identical flask). Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
