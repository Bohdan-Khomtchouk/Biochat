TITLE
The distinct roles of class I and II RPD3-like histone deacetylases in salinity stress response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand affected genes by HDA19 and HDA5/14/15/18 under salinity stress conditions, hda19 and hda5/14/15/18 mutants and control (Col-0) plants were analyzed under normal and salinity stress conditions using Arabidopsis custom microarrays (GEO array platform: GPL19830).

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted using hda19, hda5/14/15/18, and Col-0 plants subjected to non-stress and 125 mM NaCl salt-stress condition for 2 h.

PLATFORM
GPL22706 Agilent-034592 Arabidopsis thaliana PSC_Custom [Feature number version]
