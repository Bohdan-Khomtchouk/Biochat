TITLE
Gene profile of Wt and miR-155-/- Tfh cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression profile of Tfh and non-Tfh cells from both Wt and miR-155-/- mice spleens.

DESIGN
Wt and miR-155-/- mice were immunized with OVA. 8 days post immunization, CD4+CXCR+PD1+ Tfh cells and CD4+CXCR5-PD1- non Tfh cells were sorted from mice spleens for analyses.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
