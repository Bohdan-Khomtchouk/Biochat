SUMMARY
Mouse surgical model of acute lymphedema induction. We performed three sets of microarrays with three replicates each for a total of 9 arrays.  Each array was run using pooled RNA from three animals.  The three conditions were Normal tail skin (no intervention), Lymphedema tail skin(due to surgical lymphatic vessel blockage), and Surgical Sham control tail skin(surgical incision with no lymphatic vessel blockage).  15ug of test and reference (e17.5 mouse whole embryo) RNA was used for labeling. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
