TITLE
Expression data from mouse germline stem (GS), multipotent germline stem (mGS), and embryonic stem (ES) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A single spermatogonial stem cell can aquire pluripotentiality but that conversion into a pluripotent cell type is accompanied by loss of spermatogenic potential. We used microarrays to compare the expression profiles among the different stem cell types. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
GS, mGS and ES cells were cultured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We examined the gene expression profiles of GS and mGS cells to find candidate molecules that are involved in the conversion process of GS into mGS cells.
