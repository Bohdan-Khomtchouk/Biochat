TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional regulation by RBP-J

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs from bone borrow derived macrophages derived from the control (WT) and RBP-J conditional knockout mice (RBP-J KO; Rbpj f/f;LysM cre).

DESIGN
Examination of differential mRNA levels regulated by RBP-J in bone marrow derived macrophages.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
