TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between male and female blastocysts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male embryos are reported to develop faster than female in the preimplantation stage.  Therefore, male and female embryos can be considered phenotypically different as early as the preimplantation stage.  Employing our sexing system of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagging X chromosomes, we compared the global gene expression pattern of male and female embryos at the blastocyst stage using DNA microarray. Keywords= sex differentiation Keywords= preimplantation embryo Keywords= genomic imprinting Keywords: comparative hybridization
