TITLE
Expression data generated by full-length and truncated syndecan-1 overexpression in B6FS fibrosarcoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To dissect the functions of syndecan-1 in the nucleus, and separate them from functions related to the cell-surface, we transfected fibrosarcoma cells with two constructs: one encoding the full-length syndecan-1, which translocates to the nucleus and another encoding syndecan-1 lacking the RMKKK nuclear localization signal with hampered nuclear translocation. Using this model system, we combined global transcriptomic and proteomic approaches in order to disclose the molecular mechanisms governing the nuclear translocation and its related functions. Our analysis identified several genes and pathways related to the nuclear compartment TGF-Î² pathway was activated by nuclear syndecan-1 and three genes were significantly altered by NLS deletion: NEK11 , DOCK8 , and EGR-1 as potential candidates coupled to syndecan-1 in the nucleus.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (Human Gene 1.1 ST) of fibrosarcoma cells were studied in cells overexpressing full length syndecan-1 (N=3), syndecan-1 lacking its NLS (N=3) and empty vector control cells (N=3)

PLATFORM
GPL11532 [HuGene-1_1-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
