TITLE
Transcriptomes in Healthy and Diseased Gingival Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression signatures in healthy and diseased gingival tissues in 90 patients. Analysis of the gingival tissue transcriptome in states of periodontal health and disease may reveal novel insights of the pathobiology of periodontitis. Keywords: gingival tissue disease state analysis

DESIGN
Ninety non-smokers, 63 with chronic and 27 with aggressive periodontitis, each contributing with > =2 “diseased” interproximal papillae (with bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth > =4mm, and clinical attachment loss > =3mm) and a “healthy” papilla, if available (no BoP, PPD < =4mm and CAL < =2mm). RNA was extracted, amplified, reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with AffymetrixU133Plus2.0 arrays. Transcriptome analysis was conducted on a total of 247 samples (from 183 diseased and 64 healthy sites).
