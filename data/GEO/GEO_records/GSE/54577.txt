TITLE
Bacillus subtilis KS002 Targocil stimulon

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of Bacillus subtilis KS002 to targocil

DESIGN
Strain KS002 (Bacillus subtilis PY79 Î”tagGHBs::cat, amyE::Phyperspank tarGHSa spc) is a targocil sensitive B. subtilis strain, with TarGH from Staphylococcus aureus as the only WTA exporter, IPTG dependent (Schirner, Stone and Walker, ACS Chem Bio 2011). Strain KS002 was treated with or without targocil for 30 min. Each experiment was conducted three times using three independent total RNA preparations (biological triplicates). For each paried comparison, one sample was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and the other was with Alexa Fluor 647. For each comparison, one replicate was performed with dyeswap with the same RNA.
