TITLE
Grape berry: control vs NAA-treated

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing untreated berries (control) with berries treated with NAA (1-Naphthalene acetic acid, an auxin) at the preveraison stage.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control vs. treated. Comparisons were as follows: NAA-treated berries at 60 (days after full bloom (DAFB)) versus untreated berries at 60 DAFB (2 biological replicates, both dye-swapped), NAA-treated berries at 60 DAFB versus NAA-treated berries at 110 DAFB (2 biological replicates, only one dye-swapped), NAA-treated berries at 110 DAFB versus untreated berries at 110 DAFB (2 biological replicates, only one dye-swapped), and NAA-treated berries at 148 DAFB versus untreated berries at 110 DAFB (2 biological replicates, only one dye-swapped).
