TITLE
Expression data from MNV-specific CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse norovirus (MNV) causes acute or chronic infection in immunocompetent hosts, but the CD8 T cell determinants of viral persistence versus clearance are unknown. We used microarrays to interrogate the transcriptional program on MNV-specific CD8 T cells from the spleen and intestine at days 8, 15, 30 post infection with and acute or chronic strain of MNV.

DESIGN
Mice were infected with MNV-CW3 or MNV-CR6fy and tetramer-positive CD8 T cells were sorted from the spleen and intestinal epithelium at day 8, 15, and 30.  Analysis was done on an Affymetrix MoGene 2.0 Micorarrays.
