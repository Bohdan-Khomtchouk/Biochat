TITLE
Identification of microRNA-27b target genes in breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the microRNA-27b (miR-27b) target genes in luminal-type breast cancer cells, we performed the microarray analysis using miR-27b knockdown MCF7-luc cell line (MCF7-luc anti-miR-27b), miR-27b overexpressing MCF7-luc cell line (MCF7-luc miR-27b o.e.) and their contro cell line (MCF7-luc anti-NC).

DESIGN
After establishing MCF7-luc anti-miR-27b, MCF7-luc miR-27b o.e. and MCF7-luc anti-NC using lentivirus vector, we performed the microarray analysis.
