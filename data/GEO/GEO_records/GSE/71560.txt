TITLE
Prolyl hydroxylation regulates protein degradation, synthesis, and splicing in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we report the gene expression profile and MISO analysis for alternative splicing events such as exon skipping in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes which were treated with a drug  inhibiting α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases (dimethyloxalylglycine) and compared to vehicle control. α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase inhibition plays a central role in cardiac hypoxia and the goal of this study was to identify new pathways in hypoxia beyond HIF-1α.

DESIGN
Biological replicates of RNA-seq data from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes treated with dimethyloxalylglycine or vehicle control

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
