TITLE
SOL2 mutation affect gene expresstion at root apex

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of sol2 mutant. SOL2 protein is a receptor-like kinase involved in CLE peptide signalling pathway. Results provide insignt into the role of SOL2 in CLE signalling. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
GeneChip analyses were performed twice for comparison of gene expression in sol2 mutant and wild type plants.
