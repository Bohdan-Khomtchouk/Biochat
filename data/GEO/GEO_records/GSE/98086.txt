TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Peyer’s patch naive and germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Germinal center (CD19+Fas+GL7+) and naive (CD19+Fas-GL7-) B cells were sorted from Peyer's patches of littermate 12 weeks old WT C57BL/6 mice. Three biological replicates were analyzed, each composed of a pool of 5 female mice. RNA was purified from pellets of 2-2.5x10^⁴ cells and sequencing libraries were prepared from 100ng of total RNA per replicate.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of germinal center and naive B cells from Peyer’s patches of WT mice.
