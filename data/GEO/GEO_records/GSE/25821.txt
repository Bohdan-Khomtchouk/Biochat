TITLE
Expression data from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in time series experiment

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
The sumitted data compares gene expression profile of Shewnaella oneidensis MR-1 on two different sets of media conditions (nutritionally rich LB medium and Lactate minimal medium)

DESIGN
To explore the effect of various growth phases in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, the genome-wide transcriptome profiles growth in two sets media was compared to each other. Strain was grown in chemostat at 20% O2 in batch culture. Samples were collected in duplicate from both experiments.
