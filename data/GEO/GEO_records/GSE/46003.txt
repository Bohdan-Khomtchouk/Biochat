TITLE
To analyze the effect of loss of mitochondria on the transcriptome of Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
This set of experiment was done in order to analyze the effect of a dysfunctional mitochondria on C. albicans. The mutant was obtained by deleting the gene FZO1, which is known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis in S. cerevisiae. We show that the deletion of FZO1 leads to a change in mitochondrial morphology, which affects the mitochondrial membrane potential and causes the loss of mtDNA. Upon performing a transcriptome analysis, we observed that the mutant showed upregulation of genes like AOX2, MDR1 etc., while the genes involved in iron uptake were dysregulated. Besides, genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis were also downregulated.
