TITLE
Vagotomy-dependent stomach gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A vagotomy of the anterior region of the stomach of INS-GAS mice was performed at 6 month of age. The mice were sacrificed at 8, 10 and 12 months of age, The gene expression of the anterior and posterior regions of the stomach was compared at each time point.

DESIGN
The gene expression of the posterior and anterior regions of the stomach of INS-GAS mice which were anterior vagotomized at 6 months, were compared at 8, 10, and 12 months.
