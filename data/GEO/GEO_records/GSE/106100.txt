TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells after GRMI silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 cells were used to determine genes differentially regulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (GRM1)

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with GIPZ Lentiviral vectors expressing either GRM1 shRNA or a control non-silencing vector and differientially expressed genes were determined by microarray analysis after stable transduction
