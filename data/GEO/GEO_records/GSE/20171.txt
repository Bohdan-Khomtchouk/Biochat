TITLE
Bifidobacterium bifidum BF-1 Suppresses Helicobacter pylori-Induced genes in Human Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have shown that pre-incubation with Bifidobacterium bifidum (B. bifidum) strain BF-1, a probiotic strain known to improve H. pylori-associated gastritis, suppresses the induction of IL-8 by the pathogen.   To investigate how BF-1 affects gene expression in H. pylori-infected cells, we performed microarray analysis to assess gene expression in epithelial cells, which had been pre-incubated with BF-1 and infected with H. pylori.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment. Biological replicates with a dye-exchange experiment. Biological replicates with a longer incubation time experiment.
