TITLE
Gene expression analysis of inducible ES cells overexpressing Etv2 (induced for 12 hours at day 3 of differentiation)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During embryogenesis, the endothelial and the hematopoietic lineages first appear during gastrulation in the blood island of the yolk sac. We have previously reported that an Ets variant gene 2 (Etv2/ER71) mutant embryo lacks hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, however, the precise roles of Etv2 in yolk sac development remains unclear. We carried out a transcriptome analysis using an ES cell line that can inducibly express Etv2. Cells were induced  for 12 hours at day 3 of differentiation.

DESIGN
An ES cell line (dervied from mouse of background strain 129P2/Ola) with a doxycycline inducible expression casette of Etv2 (ER71 A2Lox.cre) was differentiated in hanging drops. At 3 days of differentiation, cells were treated with doxycycline for 12 hours, and subsequently Flk1(+) cells were sorted. Experiment was done in triplicate and untreated cells were used for control.
