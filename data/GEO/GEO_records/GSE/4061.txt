TITLE
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were cultured from synovial tissues from 19 RA patients. RNA was isolated using the Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California)from the FLS cultures. Fluorescent cDNA probes were prepared from 1 ug experimental mRNA by oligo dT-primed polymerization using Superscript II reverse transcriptase in the presence of Cy5 labeled dCTP.  A common reference mRNA sample (CRE) that consists of a mixture of mRNAs isolated from 11 different cell-lines, was labeled with Cy3. The Cy5 and Cy3 labeled cDNAs were pooled and hybridized to a 24,000 cDNA microarray. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
