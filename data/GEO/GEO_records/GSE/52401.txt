TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal lung tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal lung tissue samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in nor mal lung tissue samples. Samples included 244 normal lung tissue samples from lung cancer patients.

DESIGN
Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology EAGLE; Population-based case-control study Bisulphite converted DNA from 244 fresh-frozen primary human lung samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2. This file has 60 samples.
