TITLE
Ago HITS-CLIP in KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines BCBL-1 and BC-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed Ago HITS-CLIP to identify targets of viral and human miRNAs in latently KSHV-infected PEL cells

DESIGN
Ago HITS-CLIP was performed in two latently infected PEL cell lines, BCBL-1 and BC-3; Argonaute-immunoprecipitation of UV cross-linked Ago-miRNA-mRNA complexes, followed by RNA isolation, library construction, and high-throughput sequencing (Illumina GAxII); we performed 3 biological replicates for each cell line, two technical (sequencing) replicates of BCBL-1 biological replicate 1
