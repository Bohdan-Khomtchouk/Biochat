TITLE
Breast Cancer. Ull-series. 167 samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
167 Ull-samples 244k array Tumor tissue from a series of 212 primary breast cancers were sequentially collected at Ullev√•l University Hospital, Oslo, Norway between 1990 and 1994. Tissues were collected at the time of primary surgery and snap frozen. We performed aCGH on 167 of these samples. DNA was isolated using chloroform/phenol extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The aCGH-platform was the Agilent Human genome CGH Microarray 244k. The aim of this study was to investigate the genome wide genomic copy number alterations in a cohort of primary breast cancer patients.

DESIGN
167 tumor samples analyzed with 244k Agilent CGH-arrays, Promega reference DNA, no technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9128 Agilent-014693 Human Genome CGH Microarray 244A (Probe name version)
