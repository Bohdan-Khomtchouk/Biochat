TITLE
Effect of Estrogen Receptor Beta Ligand on Gene Expression in White Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 male mice were fed with normal diet or high fat diet and treated with vehicle or 30 mg/kg/day s.c. of ER-beta ligand, B-LGND2. Genes differentially expressed by H.F.D. and B-LGND2 are represented in this RNA-Sequencing data

DESIGN
n=3/group. White adipose tissue. Mice were fed and treated as indicated above for 9 weeks. WAT was collected, RNA isolated, and expression of genes was measured by RNA-Sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
