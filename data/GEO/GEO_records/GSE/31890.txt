TITLE
ChIP-chip from Drosophila egg chambers using ORC2 antibody

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) followed by hybridization to genome-wide tiling microarrays demonstrated that ORC does not localize to DAFC-34B after stage 10, despite a second round of replication initiation

DESIGN
Comparison of ORC2 ChIP sample compared to input DNA for Drosophila egg chambers
