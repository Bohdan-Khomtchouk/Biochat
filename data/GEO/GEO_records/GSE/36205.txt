TITLE
Identification of Magnaporthe oryzae elicited small RNAs and expression profiles in resistant and susceptible rice cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
To identify blast pathogen elicited miRNAs, four sRNA libraries were constructed: 8749036, A library, susceptible rice cultivar Zhonger-Ruanzhan; 12157795, B library, mock-treated blast resistant line H4; 9937360, C library, blast-treated susceptible rice cultivar Zhonger-Ruanzhan; and 11138187 clean reads, D library, blast-treated blast resistant line H4. The Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP; Beijing Genomics Institute) matched 85.46% (A, 7476714), 79.35% (B, 9647324), 77.70% (C, 7721715) and 76.10% (D, 8476386) sRNA reads to the genome. After removing other RNA categories matched to NCBI Genbank, Rfam database, known rice miRNA precursor, repeat associated RNA and siRNA, the remaining reads: 1681359(A); 3829741(B); 3182403(C); and 3970132(D), were used for further novel miRNA prediction. Since some miRNAs were tissue-specific, time-specific or stress-induced, only 291, 210, 164 and 220 registered miRNAs were identified in libraries A, B, C and D respectively. Thirty-one (A, 9385 reads), 399(B, 41024 read), 351(C, 36622 reads) and 333(D, 38064 reads) unique sRNAs were projected to be candidate miRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of mock-treated rice cultivar, mock-treated blast resistant rice line H4, blast-treated susceptible rice cultivar, and blast-treated blast resistant rice line H4.
