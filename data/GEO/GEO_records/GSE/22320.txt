TITLE
Whole Cell Extract for Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are an example of an early differentiated cell type.  The whole cell extract was prepared in order to have background information for additional ChIP-Seq experiments in MEFs. The WCE data is a useful dataset that can be used as a background for many different analysis purposes.

DESIGN
MEFs were sonicated, DNA was purified and prepared for solexa sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
