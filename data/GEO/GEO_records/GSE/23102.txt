TITLE
Expression profiles from HEK293 cells by overexpression of TRPM7 channel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The functional activity of TRPM7 is essential for cell viability and growth, and its expression is up-regulated in certain pathological conditions. In order to assess the effects of TRPM7 activity on cellular gene expression, inducible HEK293 cell-lines harboring the wild-type mouse TRPM7 and a mutant lacking the kinase domain were established. By using microarray analysis, we identified genetic profiles altered in transcription significantly and specifically by the expression of the functional TRPM7 channel.

DESIGN
Overexpression of TRPM7 channel in HEK cells induce the cell damage and cell death. So we used tetracycline-inducible system for channel expression. However, since the treatment of inducer itself could also affect the transcription profile, we established another cell-line harboring a nonfunctional TRPM7 mutant (TRPM7DKD) as a control in which the entire kinase domain at the C-terminus was deleted. The wild-type and the non-functional TRPM7 channels were induced transiently, and the comparative changes in cellular transcription were investigated
