TITLE
Evaluation of lipin-1 effects on gene expression during TLR4 stimulation of macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lipin-1 affects the expression levels of many genes during TLR4 stimulation of macrophages.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of peritoneal macrophages from four control (hetorozygotes) mice and four lipin-1 mutant (fatty liver distrophy, fld) mice stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 5 hours.
