TITLE
bulk RNAseq of uninjured and 18 hours post-methyl bromide lesion FACS Horizontal basal cells (HBCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of uninjured vs 18hpl injured HBCs show heterogeneous modulation of pathways associated with quiescent stem cell activation. HBCs are the trp63 expressing, quiescent basal stem cell in the olfactory epithelium.

DESIGN
Illumina HiSeq of triplicates of uninjured vs 18hpl FACS HBC samples isolated from Krt5-CreER;Ai9 Fl(stop)TdTomato lineage trace animals, induced with Tamoxifen 2 weeks prior to FACS. Each triplicate contains pooled cells from multiple animals, followed by standard differential gene expression

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
