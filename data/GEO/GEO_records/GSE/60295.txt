TITLE
The G protein-coupled pH-sensing receptor OGR1 is a regulator of intestinal inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OGR1 is a pH sensing G protein-coupled receptor involved in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Up-regulation of genes, mediated by OGR1, in response to extracellular acidification were enriched for inflammation, immune response, actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion pathways.

DESIGN
Microarray profiling was performed to compare global gene expression of Ogr1 KO and WT residential peritoneal macrophages in response to an acidic pH shift (pH 6.7, 24 h)
