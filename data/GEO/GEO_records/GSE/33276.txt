TITLE
Gene expression profiles of S. cerevisiae under heat stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genes whose expression correlated to the degree of thermotolerance in S. cerevisiae were identified by DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of three S. cerevisiae strains showing different levels of thermotolerance were compared and a thermotolerance-related gene chosen.
