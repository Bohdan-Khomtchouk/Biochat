TITLE
Gene expression data from H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-138 has a variety of biological functions because of its capacity to act on different target genes in various cells and tissues; however, the targets of miR-138 in human non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1299 cannot be determined by bioinformatics alone. Thus, H1299 cells overexpressing miR-138 in H1299 cells were subjected to microarray analysis to analyse the differences of gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from H1299 cells transfected with miR-138 or NC mimics for 48h. Their gene expression profiles were investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 platform.
