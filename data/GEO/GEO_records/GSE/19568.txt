TITLE
H2A.Z Mapping During G0/G1 and Mitosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report genome wide mapping of the histone variant H2A.Z during G0/G1 and mitosis in T24 bladder cancer cells.  The results show that the broad enrichment pattern of H2A.Z near transcription start sites of active genes is maintained during mitosis.  Furthermore, using H2A.Z localization to visualize nucleosome positioning near the start site, we see that the  +1 nucleosome of active genes shifts upstream to occupy the transcription start sites during mitosis and the nucleosome depleted region is shortened.  H2A.Z is also maintained on the -2 nucleosome which also shifts towrds the transcription start site during mitosis, further contributing to the shorteneing of the nucleosome depleted region.
