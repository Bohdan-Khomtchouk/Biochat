TITLE
Aberrant splicing of U12-type introns is the hallmark of ZRSR2 mutant myelodysplastic syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene ZRSR2— located on the X chromosome — are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ZRSR2 is involved in the recognition of 3΄ splice site during the early stages of spliceosome assembly; however, its precise role in RNA splicing has remained unclear. Here, we characterize ZRSR2 as an essential component of the minor spliceosome (U12-dependent) assembly. shRNA mediated knockdown of ZRSR2 leads to impaired splicing of the U12-type introns, and RNA-Sequencing of MDS bone marrow reveals that loss of ZRSR2 activity causes increased mis-splicing. These splicing defects involve retention of the U12-type introns while splicing of the U2-type introns remain mostly unaffected. ZRSR2 deficient cells also exhibit reduced proliferation potential and distinct alterations in myeloid and erythroid differentiation in vitro. These data identify a specific role for ZRSR2 in RNA splicing and highlight dysregulated splicing of U12-type introns as a characteristic feature of ZRSR2 mutations in MDS.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on 16 bone marrow samples (MDS and normal)  and six samples of control or ZRSR2 shRNA transduced TF-1 cells and data was analysed for aberrant splicing caused by ZRSR2 mutations/deficiency.
