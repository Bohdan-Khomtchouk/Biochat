TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation of UV treated AdHBx cells with anti-HBx antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Direct gene targets of HepG2 cells transduced with Adenoviral vector carrying HBx vs Adenoviral vector under UV treatment Keywords: ChIP-chip profiling

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, AdHBx (experimental) UV vs AdEasy (vector control) UV.  HepG2 cells were infected with either recombinant HBx adenoviruses (AdHBx) or control adenoviruses (AdEasy). Seventy-two hours later, infected cells were exposed for 30 seconds to UVC (254 nm) irradiation with a germicidal lamp calibrated to deliver 8 or 16 J/m2.  Cells were then harvested for either ChIP-chip profiling or expression microarray profiling.
