TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Corynebacterium glutamicum in response to furfural presence

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
To understrand the altered global gene expression levels in C. glutamicum wild type in presence of furfural, transcriptome profiling was performed.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of the wild type grown in CgXII medium without furfural and with furfural stresses (each 6.5 mM, 13 mM, and 20 mM) were compared by using the samples taken at the OD600 of 6 (for the control and experiments). Each experiment was performed with a duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL14656 MYcroarray CAT-3x20K-Corynebacterium_glutamicum_ATCC_13032
