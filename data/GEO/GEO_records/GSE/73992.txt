TITLE
Profiling of Mll1 in mouse epiblast stem cells and H3K4me1/3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the epigenetic profiling of 1) Mll1 in mouse EpiSCs with or without MM401 tratment and 2) H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in MM401 trated EpiSCs.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profiles of Mll1 were generated in mEpiSCs with or without MM401; ChIP-Seq profiles of H3K4me1/3 were generated in EpiSCs treated with MM401 for 4 days. For each condition, a sequence profile of genomic DNA (Input) is also included.

PLATFORM
