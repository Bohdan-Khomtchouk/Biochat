TITLE
Expression data from 0Month (New Born) Slovak Children with high PCBs exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) is known to cause serious health effects in human both in pre- and post-natal period. The knowledge of gene expression will help us to develop early disease or disorder biomarkers for PCB induced health effects. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile underlying the effects of high PCB exposure from the cord blood of the PCB-exposed newborn in Slovakia to understand the molecular mechanism of PCB related toxic effect and its functional implications during fetal development.

DESIGN
High PCB Exposed 0 month Slovak Children Extraction of total RNA was performed by using Qiagen PAXgene Blood RNA Kit IVD according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 microgram of total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix). Following fragmentation, 10 microgram of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Human Genome Array (HGU133 plus 2.0). GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000. The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 150.
