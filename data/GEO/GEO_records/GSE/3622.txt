TITLE
Identification of Francisella tularensis genes affected by iron limitation

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis

SUMMARY
Three pairs of total RNA preparations from F. t. LVS grown under iron-replete and iron-restricted conditions were used in the DNA microarray.  Seven arrays were used to examine the genes affected by iron limitation. Keywords: Dual Channel (Cy5/Cy3) arrays

DESIGN
Oligonucleotides designed according to F. t. Schu4 sequence were spotted in triplicate on the arrays.  cDNA generated from F. t. LVS total RNA were labeled and hybridized with the arrays.
