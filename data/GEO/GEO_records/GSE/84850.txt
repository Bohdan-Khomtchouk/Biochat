TITLE
Cyclin Y-mediated changes in RNA-sequencing based transcriptome profiling in hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptome changes mediated by Cyclin Y in rat hippocampal neurons.

DESIGN
Cultured hippocampal neurons were infected with lentivirus expressing EGFP (as control), CCNY-WT-EGFP (for CCNY overexpression) or CCNY-shRNA-EGFP (for CCNY knockdown) at DIV5-6 and the neuronal cell lysates were harvested at DIV14 for total RNA isolation and subsequent RNA-seq.  Total 3 conditioned samples with duplicates each were performed.
