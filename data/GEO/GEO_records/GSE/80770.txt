TITLE
miRNA expression of myeloma patient samples under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted whole miRNA screening against the MM patients bone marrow (sorted by CD38++) cells that were subjected by chronic hypoxia condition.

DESIGN
We compired four primary myeloma samples cultured under hypoxia with cultured under normoxia (48hr) to find new important miRNAs of myeloma.
