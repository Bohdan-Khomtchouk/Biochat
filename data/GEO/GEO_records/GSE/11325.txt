TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of ragged seedling2 shoot apical meristem (SAM) vs non-mutant SAM

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The recessive mutation ragged seedling2-R (rgd2-R) conditions defective lateral development of maize leaves.  Although dorsiventral patterning is established in rgd2-R mutant leaves, some swapping of adaxial/abaxial epidermal identity may occur.  Molecular analyses indicate that RGD2 is required for the coordination of dorsiventral and lateral patterning during maize leaf development, yet the RGD2 gene product and the mechanisms of RGD2 function are unknown. In order to investigate the genetic mechanisms downstream of RGD2 gene function, SAM-specific transcriptional profiling of rgd2-R is compared to that of nonmutant using laser microdissection microarray. Whole SAMs were laser-microdissected from rgd2-R mutant and non-mutant seedlings grown under the same controlled conditions. Microarray profiles were generated for 28,671 maize cDNAs contained on gene chips SAM 1.1and SAM 3.0 ( http://www.plantgenomics.iastate.edu/maizechip/ ). Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, rgd2 SAM vs non-mutant SAM cells. 6 Biological replicates with dye swap. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL3333 SAM1.1a GPL3538 SAM3.0
