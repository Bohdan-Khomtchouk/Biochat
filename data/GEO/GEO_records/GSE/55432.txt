TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in response to conditional miRNA mediated BSP knockdown.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to identify the genes, which are modulated following conditional BSP knockdown for 3 and 6 days. Thus, to elucidate the BSP relevance and to broaden the knowledge on the affected signalling pathways.

DESIGN
Cell pellets were collected after 3 and 6 days of cultivating the cells in media with or without doxycycline. There were duplicated total RNA samples for each time interval and each condition.The mRNA expression of the in vitro miRNA treated cells was compared to the respective +dox control.
