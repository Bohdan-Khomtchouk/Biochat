TITLE
Prostate Cancer Gene Expression Changes after Treatment with Neoadjuvant Dutasteride

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify molecular changes underlying the chemopreventive or tumor promoting effects of SRD5A inhibition, we profiled gene expression changes in benign prostate epithelium from patients with PCa treated with dutasteride, a dual SRD5A inhibitor. Subjects were aged 45-80 years with clinically localized PCa (T1C to T2b), Gleason score < 7, and serum PSA 2.5-10 ng/dL. 81 men were randomized to immediate RP  (n=25) or to dutasterdie at 0.5 mg (n=26) or 3.5 mg (n=24) orally per day for four months prior to RP. Prostate samples embedded in OCT were used for laser capture microdissection (LCM). Keywords: clinical trial, Dutasteride, PEDB, dose response, prostate cancer, microarray
