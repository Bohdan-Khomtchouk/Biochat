TITLE
Promiscuous gene expression in human medullary thymic epithelial cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Different human mTEC subsets (MUC1, CEACAM5 and SGLT1) were purified by sequential enzymatic digestion (collagenase/dispase, trypsin) followed by enrichment using magnetic beads (CD45 beads, Miltenyi Biotech) and FACS sorting.   Cells of the surface phenotype CD45-, CDR2-, EpCAM+ were further subdivided into MUC1+/MUC1-, CEACAM5+/CEACAM5- and SGLT1+/SGLT1- fractions. RNA was isolated using μMACS™ SuperAmp™ protocol (Miltenyi Biotec) and hybridized to Illumina Whole-Genome Expression Beadchips. Gene expression of Antigen-positive and Antigen-negative mTEC subsets was compared.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from ex-vivo isolated human mTEC subsets using μMACS™ SuperAmp™ protocol (Miltenyi Biotec)
