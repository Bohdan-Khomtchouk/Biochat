TITLE
Gene expressions in reaggregated thymus organ culture (RTOC) and 2D culture of thymic stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles between RTOC and 2D culture of thymic stromal cells Beta5t, which is a specific subunit of thymoproteasomes, is indispensable for maturation of CD8+ T cells. beta5t is expressed in thymus, and it is necessary for its expression to maintain 3D architecture of thymus. To search for the genes associated with its expression, we performed the microarray analysis, and compared expression levels of each gene between reaggregate thymus organ culture (RTOC) and 2D culture of thymic stromal cells.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments were performed using fetal thymus from E14.5 and E15.5 mice.
