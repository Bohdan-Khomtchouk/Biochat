TITLE
Liver gene expression profiling of cytosolic malic enzyme knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytosolic malic enzyme (Me1) was predicted as a causal gene for abdominal using a novel statistical method named LCMS (Schadt et al., 2005, Nature Genetics). In order to validate this prediction, we profiled the liver tissues of Me1 knockout mice (Me1-/-) and their littermate wild-type (wt) controls to examine the gene expression signature as well as pathways/networks resulting from the single gene perturbation.
