TITLE
H3K18Ac and H3K18Cr ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
(1) We sought to characterize the genomic profiles of H3K18Ac and H3K18Cr before and after the activation of the LPS-induced inflamatory response to elucidate the role of differential acylation in the process of gene activation. We performed chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) with two antibodies, anti-H3K18Ac and anti-H3K18Cr, in RAW264.7 cells +/- LPS stimulation. (2)  We also sought to characterize the effect of increasing the cellular concentration of crotonyl-CoA prior to LPS-stimulation on the expression of different classes of LPS-induced genes. We performed RNA-seq on mRNA isolated from RAW264.7 cells under four conditions a) untreated and unstimulated, b) untreated and LPS stimulated, c) crotonate pre-treated and unstimulated, d) crotonate pre-treated and LPS stimulated. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina).

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K18Ac and H3K18Cr in RAW264.7 cells +/- LPS stimulation and RNA-seq of RAW264.7 cells +/- LPS stimulation and +/- sodium crotonate pretreatment
