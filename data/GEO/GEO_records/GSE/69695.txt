TITLE
Psh1-mediated Proteolysis Prevents the Budding Yeast   Centromeric Histone Variant from Mislocalizing to Promoter Nucleosomes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Precise localization of the histone H3 variant CENP-A(Cse4) to centromeres is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, CENP-A(Cse4) is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis to ensure its exclusive localization to the centromere. Overexpression of CENP-A(Cse4) is lethal when the CENP-A(Cse4) E3 ubiquitin ligase, Psh1, is deleted.  To identify the genomic sites of CENP-A(Cse4) mislocalization in this condition, we investigated the genome-wide mislocalization pattern of CENP-A(Cse4) by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Flag-Cse4 ChIP DNA and Input MNased chromatin DNA were sequenced for one biological replicate from each of 4 experimental strains.
