TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in the GAS M1T1 strain 5448, wild-type vs pepO mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Manuscript title: The endopeptidase PepO regulates the SpeB cysteine protease and is essential for the virulence of invasive M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes. The study investigates the effect of pepO mutation on global gene expression in GAS M1T1 strain 5448.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GAS M1T1 strain 5448 WT vs. pepO mutant. Biological replicates: 3, independently grown and harvested. One replicate of each strain per array.

PLATFORM
GPL19152 M1, M3, M18 GAS Array
