TITLE
Total Gene expression analysis of H3f3b constitutive knockout testis RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total gene expression analysis was performed on RNA from testes extracted from two litters of constitutive homozygous and heterozygous H3f3b knockout mice compared to WT littermates.

DESIGN
Constitutive knockout mice were obtained by mating H3f3b Fl/Fl mice to Zp3Cre mice. Heterozygous knockout mice were crossed until homozygous knockout mice were obtained. Testes were surgically removed from 8 week old homozygous knockouts, heterozygous knockouts and WT, and RNA was extracted from one testis from each mouse for total gene expression.
