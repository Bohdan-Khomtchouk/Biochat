TITLE
Expression data from calvaria of 10-day-old 13del-tg transgenic mice displaying bone overgrowth.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ectopic expression of a Col10a1-13del transgene in osteocytes induced ER stress, compromising their differentiation and expression of Sclerostin, resulting in generalized bone overgrowth resembling human crainodiaphyseal chondrodysplasia (CCD). To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the phenotype, we employed global gene expression profiling analysis.

DESIGN
Calvaria bones from 10-day-old (P10) 13del-tg and wild type control littermates (n=3 for each genotype) were obtained for total RNA extraction and hybridization to microarray chips.
