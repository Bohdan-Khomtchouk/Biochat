TITLE
Dynamic regulation of chromatin signatures during Drosophila embryonic glial differentiation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of affinity-purified nuclei of GBs and glias from the Drosophila embryos.

DESIGN
Expression profiles were generated from GBs and glias nuclei, which isolated from5–7h-old gcm-Gal4,UAS-mCDGFP/cyo;UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap and 12–14h-old repo-Gal4,UAS-3xFLAG-blrp-mCherry-RanGap/Tm3B D. melanogaster embryos using the method INTACT (Steinner et al., 2012). We profiled gene expression during Drosophila embryonic glial differentiation.
