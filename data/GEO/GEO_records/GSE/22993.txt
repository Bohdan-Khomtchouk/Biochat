TITLE
Global gene profiling of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced neuronal death

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AMPA receptors are involved not only in neuronal plasticity but also in excitotoxicity, mediated largely by the influx of Ca2+ (Choi et al., 1988). Their implication has been highlighted in animal models of ischemia and epilepsy. Studies of ischemic rodent models featured that prior to cell death, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells exhibit an increased AMPA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx and decreased GluR2 and GluR3 mRNA and protein levels (Gorter et al., 1997; Heuerteaux et al., 1995).

DESIGN
A total of 15 RNA samples were analyzed. Cultured murine primary cortical neurons were treated with 300uM AMPA over a time-course of 5h, 15h and 24h (n=3) in addition to the vehicle control (n=6).
