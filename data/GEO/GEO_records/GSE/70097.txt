TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and AFB1 resistant liver sample from rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Applied de novo assembly, both protein coding and non-coding RNAs were profiled in AFB1 induced HCC and AFB1 resistant liver sample. Compared with normal liver, the perturbation on transcriptome was revealed in multiple aspects, implying the potential mechanism of toxic resistance.

DESIGN
All rats were randomly divided into control and treated groups according to their weight. Then AFB1 was injected intraperitoneally to treated group in customized schedule. Biopsy was applied every 10 weeks on both groups. Tissues from rats died of HCC were reserved. All rats were sacrificed at 70th week. According to whether tumor formed, liver tissues from animals in treated group were further divided into AFB1 induced tumor sample and AFB1 resistant sample. Both samples were stored for later transcriptome analysis, as well as the normal sample from control group. RNA profiles of all 3 samples were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.
