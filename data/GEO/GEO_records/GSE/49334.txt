TITLE
Mapping of somatic linker histone H1 variants in T47D-MTVL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
At least six histone H1 variants exist in mammalian somatic cells that bind to the linker DNA and stabilize the nucleosome particle contributing to higher order chromatin compaction. In addition, H1 seems to be involved in the active regulation of gene expression. It is not well known whether the different variants have specific roles, are distributed differentially along the genome, or regulate specific promoters. By taking advantage of specific antibodies to H1 variants and HA-tagged recombinant H1 variants expressed in a breast cancer-derived cell line, we have investigated the distribution of the different somatic H1 variants (H1.2 to H1.5, H1.0 and H1X) in particular promoters and genome-wide.

Genome-wide analysis of H1.0, H1.2, H1.4, H1X and H3
