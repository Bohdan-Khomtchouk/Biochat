TITLE
10nM insulin stimulation of Fao Cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To confirm how many and what kind of gene changes within 1 hour treatment of insulin stimulation,  we have performed whole genome microarray expression profiling. And we found that 276 genes increased ( > 2 fold) or decreased ( < 0.5 fold)

DESIGN
10nM insulin induced gene expression in Fao cells was measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 min.
