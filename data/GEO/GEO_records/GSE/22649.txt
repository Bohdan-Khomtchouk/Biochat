TITLE
Transcriptional response on ccw12 mutant from S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ccw12p is a cell surface mannoprotein required for cell wall stability. To investigate the compensation mechanism after CCW12 deletion we analysed the global gene expression in ccw12 mutant cells.

DESIGN
SEY6210 and MEY12A (SEY6210 deleted for CCW12) yeast strains were growth on YPD medium supplemented with adenine. RNA was extracted from two biological replicates of each strain after identical culturing. The RNA samples were analyzed using Affymetrix YG S98 DNA microarrays and transcriptional profiles of MEY12A vs SEY6210 were compared
