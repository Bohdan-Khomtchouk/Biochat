TITLE
Genome-Wide Expression Profiling of B-CLL cells vs Healthy B cells cultured in high density

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant expression of TNFR-1 is induced in CLL cells in the lymphoid microenvironment and stimulation of TNFR-1 increases CLL cell viability.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of CLL cells and CD19-sorted B cells of healthy donors before and after being cultured for 1 day in high cell density

PLATFORM
GPL9243 DKFZ SC102 / Operon Human 38k V4.0 - r1
