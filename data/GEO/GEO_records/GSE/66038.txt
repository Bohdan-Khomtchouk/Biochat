TITLE
Effects of miRNA-mediated TET2 in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. We identified that miR-29 family is the most androgen-responsive  miRNA in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. For the screening of miR-29b target, we performed microarray analysis in two prostate cancer cells. Because TET2 is the primary target of miR-29 family by our analysis, we also performed TET2 signaling by microarray. In order to investigate the downsteam signals mediated by TET2 and miR-29b, we performed comprehensive analysis of gene expression in positive prostate cancer cell lines after siTET2 or miR-29b treatment.

DESIGN
Observation of gene expression changes after treatmet with siRNA targeting TET2 or miR-29b in prostate cancer cell lines with microarray.
