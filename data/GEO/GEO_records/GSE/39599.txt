TITLE
Helicobacter pylori-mediated Epigenetic Dysregulation of FOXD3 Tumor-suppressive Cascade In Gastric Carcinogenesis [MMASS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Promoter hypermethylation occurs in human gastric cancers, but whether the deregulated genes contribute to the multi-step Helicobacter pylori (H pylori)-induced gastric carcinogenesis remains unclear. We used Microarray-based Methylation Assessment of Single Samples (MMASS) to identify differential methylated genes in 10 human gastric cancer tissues.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, gastric cancers from patients (n = 5 per group) who survived 5 years or more (long-term survivors group) and who died of disease prior to 5 years (short-term survivors group)

PLATFORM
GPL2040 UHN Human CpG 12K Array (HCGI12K)
