TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast and mitochondria

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Here, we report on the transcriptome of the organelles of the micro-alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, sampled under a number of different conditions. The preparation of the RNA-Seq libraries and their analysis were performed using protocols optimized for organellar transcripts. Samples include growth in media +/– Fe, growth in media +/– Cu, diurnal growth samples collected in dark and light, and the sexual cycle.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sampled under 12 different conditions including: diurnal growth in light, diurnal growth in dark, +Fe, –Fe, +Cu, –Cu, mt+ vegetative, mt– vegetative, mt+ gamete, mt– gamete, zygote, and post-germination.
