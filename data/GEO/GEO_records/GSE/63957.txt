TITLE
TRPM7 maintains mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells by tensional regulation of SOX4 (SOX4 shRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of SOX4 on global gene expression levels in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Results were used for the identification of overlapping up- and downregulated genes in TRPM7 + SOX4 shRNA MDA-MB-231 cells

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA  (shCntrl) or SOX4 shRNA (shSOX4#1)

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
