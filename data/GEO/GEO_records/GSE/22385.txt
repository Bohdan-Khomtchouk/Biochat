TITLE
Gene profiling: U87 IRE1 dominant negative cells vs. U87ctrl cells in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was performed from human U87 glioblastoma cell clones: U87 IRE1.NCK DN (U87dn, IRE1 dominant negative) and U87 control  (U87ctrl, empty plasmid). Cells were  grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine for 16 hours in culture prior mRNA isolation and analyses

DESIGN
U87dn cells expressing a dominant negative transgene of IRE1alpha were compared to U87ctrl cells transfected with the corresponding empty plamid to identify genes associated to tumor invasion and angiogenesis.
