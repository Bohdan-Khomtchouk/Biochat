TITLE
Gene expression profile in porcine buccal pouch mucosal cells during long-term in vitro culture

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The most experiments about buccal pouch mucosal cells were investigated in mice and hamster. In these studies we have used porcine buccal pouch mucosal cells cultured primarily in vitro to investigate the expression profile of new molecular markers of mucosal wounding, vascularization and proliferation. In this study, we demonstrated the gene expression profile of long time primary cultured porcine buccal pouch mucosal cells.

DESIGN
Mucosal cells were obtained from 9 months old crossbred landrace glits. The cells were harvested 7 days, 15 days and 30 days after beginning of culture and submited to RNA isolation and microarray analisys.
