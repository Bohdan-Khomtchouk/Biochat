TITLE
Organ-specific light-responsive gene expression profiling assay using 18kA and 18kB soybean cDNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
An expression profiling assay comparing dark-grown soybean seedlings with seedlings treated with 1 h far-red light using different organs including cotyledons, hook, and hypocotyl with the soybean cDNA 18kA and 18kB microarrays.

DESIGN
Pairwise comparisons of far-red-light-treated samples and dark-grown samples in three organs: cotyledons, hook, and hypocotyl. Each comparison was done with 4 biological replicates with a dye swap.
