TITLE
A transcriptomic resource for Douglas-fir seed development and analysis of transcription during late megagametophyte development

ORGANISM
Pseudotsuga menziesii

SUMMARY
We developed a transcriptome resource for Douglas-fir covering key developmental stages of megagametophytes over time: prefertilization, fertilization, embryogenesis, and early, unfertilized abortion. Extracted RNA was sequenced using large-scale sequencing and reads were assembled to generate a de novo reference transcriptome of 105,505 predicted high-confidence transcripts. Expression levels were estimated based on alignment of the original reads to the reference.

DESIGN
200â€“400 megagametophytes were dissected and pooled per sample on four dates from either pollinated or unpollinated cones: June 10, June 22, June 30, and July 6 2011. These dates coincided with key events in seed development: corrosion cavity formation, fertilization, embryogenesis, or the early stages of abortion in the unpollinated treatment. Sporophytic tissue (i.e. cone bracts and cone scales) were added for comparison. PolyA RNA was used for Illumina sequencing.
