TITLE
In situ synthesis of peptide microarrays - shadow mask design [3]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this paper several computer programs were used to simulate in situ synthesis of peptides using shadow masks and BOC synthesis.  The peptides were designed to be random, or pseudo-random, but fulfill requirements of immunosignaturing.  This file contains data from actual 330,000 peptide arrays that used the first iteration of the peptide generation algorithm.  Monoclonal antibodies were bound to the microarrays and the total number of peptides that distinguished each monoclonal was measured.  This provides a baseline against which to compare purely random sequences.

DESIGN
One replicate of each peptide was printed on 1 330k peptide microarray. One microarray were tested for each sample. Image was qualified using in-house metrics for quality assurance.

PLATFORM
GPL17679 330K random-sequence peptide microarrays
