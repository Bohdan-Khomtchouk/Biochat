TITLE
Expression file from FGF-10 experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiating embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes is inefficient, and we discover that FGF-10 can induce embryonic stem cells differentiation into cardiomyocytes. We use microarray to gain insight into the global gene expression and elucidate the machenism that FGF-10 induces embryonic stem cells differentiation into cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
Two-day embryoid bodies were treated with or without 100 ng/ml FGF10 and RNA was obtained 24 hours later and hybridized by Affymetrix microarray
