TITLE
Effect of excessive c-MYC expression on self-replication and apoptosis of iPS cell-derived megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further address the mechanism by which excessive c-MYC represses self-replication and induces apoptosis, microarray analysis of iPSC-derived megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines(MKCLs) with high or low level of c-MYC expression were examined.

DESIGN
We established iPS cell lines integrated with DD-tagged c-MYC genes whose protein expression level could be controlled by the concentration of Shield-1. Gene expressions of iPSC-derived MKCLs with high or low levels of ectopic c-MYC were analyzed by microarray.
