TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of poly(I:C)-responsive gene expression by primary human keratinocytes with and without episomal human papillomavirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of high-risk human papillomaviruses HPV16 and HPV18 in keratinocytes at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that HPVs inhibit the function of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), thereby evading the immune system. Results show that HPV-positive keratinocytes have a weaker response to poly(I:C), a synthetic double strand RNA agonist of viral PRRs, with IL1B as a central hub in a gene expression network of relative downregulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA from eight primary undifferentiated keratinocyte cultures, four uninfected and four HPV-positive, that were either left unstimulated, or stimulated for 4 or 24 hrs with 25 ug/ml poly(I:C).
