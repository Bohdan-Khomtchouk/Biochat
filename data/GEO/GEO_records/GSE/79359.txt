TITLE
Role of light in cyanophage infection of Prochlorococcus

ORGANISM
Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris str. CCMP1986 ; Prochlorococcus phage P-HM2

SUMMARY
We report the full transcriptome of T4-like cyanophage P-HM2 infecting Prochlorococcus in light and dark

DESIGN
Inoculate Prochlorococcus culture growing in constant light with cyanophage or spent medium, then transfer back to light or to dark (separate experiments done on separate days), then measure total RNA at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 8.5 h post-inoculation.

PLATFORM
GPL21611 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris str. CCMP1986; Prochlorococcus phage P-HM2)
