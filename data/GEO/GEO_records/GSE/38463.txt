TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse B cell progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed of Pax5 wild type bone marrow subsets from common lymphoid progenitors through to Hardy stage F cells. These cells were obtained by flow sorting of bone marrow.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on 41 samples of RNA extracted from flow sorted B cell precursor populations from common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) through to Hardy stage F. Note that several of the genes expressed in normal mouse B cell progenitors are also involved by deletion/mutation in hypodiploid ALL.
