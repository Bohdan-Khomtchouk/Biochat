TITLE
Dysregulated synaptic gene expression and axonal neuropathology in a human iPSC-based model of familial Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated de novo induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two Parkinson’s Disease patients (PD) harboring the p.A53T mutation. iPSC-derived mutant neurons displayed disease-relevant phenotypes at basal conditions, including protein aggregation, compromised neuritic outgrowth and contorted axons with swollen varicosities containing αSyn and tau. We have performed RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of neurons from PD patient and control samples. RNA sequencing has also been performed to neurons derived from HUES samples subjected to the same differentiation protocol as reference.

DESIGN
We have performed RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) in neurons PD and control samples (two clones from each individual), along with HUES-derived neurons.
