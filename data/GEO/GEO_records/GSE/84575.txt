TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mononuclear cells derived from bone marrow of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leucosis, acute lymphoid leucosis and from heathy donors peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this research was to explore activation/deactivation of signaling pathways in mononuclear cells from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leucosis and acute lymphoid leucosis.

DESIGN
Mononuclear cells were separated shortly after bone marrow or blood samples collection. Cells were obtained by a density gradient centrifugation method using Ficoll. Cells were dissolved in RNALater solution, aliquoted and stored at -20Â°C till RNA extraction and microarray hybridisation.
