TITLE
Temporal transcriptomic analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana - Botrytis cinerea interaction

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis leaves comparing mock-treated leaves with Botrytis cinerea infected leaves over a time-course (12 and 24 hrs).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mock-treated vs infected leaves. Biological replicates: 5 Mock-treated, 5 infected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
