TITLE
The LINC01138 Drives Malignancies via Activating Arginine Methyltransferase 5 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study have demonstrated LINC01138 acts as an oncogenic driver that promotes cell proliferation, tumourigenicity, tumour invasion and metastasis through physically interacting with Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in HCC cells. In order to investigate the related signaling pathways regulated by LINC01138 or PRMT5, we performed the unbiased transcriptome profiling using high-throughput RNA sequencing in SMMC-7721 cells transfected with si-LINC01138 or si-PRMT5. Here we showed the LINC01138/PRMT5 axis is an ideal therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

DESIGN
Illuminate the related signaling pathways and biological processes regulated by LINC01138 or PRMT5 in human liver cancer SMMC-7721 cells through high-throughput sequencing data.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
