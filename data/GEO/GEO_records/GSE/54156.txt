TITLE
Circulating miRNAs spectra in plasma of multiple myeloma patients compared with healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNAs whose dysregulation of expression plays an important role in cancer development. Circulating miRNAs are novel biomarkers in several cancers. Thus, we explored whether the miRNAs in plasma could be useful clinical biomarkers for multiple myeloma (MM) patients. The expression levels of four miRNAs in plasma were upregulated while eight miRNAs were downregulated in MM patients compared with healthy controls according to microarray.

DESIGN
MiRNA microarray was conducted to determine deregulated miRNAs in plasma of 9 MM patients and 7 healthy controls.
