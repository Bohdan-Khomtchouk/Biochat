TITLE
The role of Set7 in differentiation of embryonic stem cells to smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells, Stem cell antigen1 (Sca1) cells, and Sca1 cells with shRNA knock-down of Set7.

DESIGN
4 sample groups, each with 2 replicates. (1) untreated embryonic stem cells, (2) untreated Sca1 cells, (3) Sca1 cells with Set7 shRNA knock-down, (4) Sca1 cells with non targeting control plasmid

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
