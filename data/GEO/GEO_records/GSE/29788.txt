TITLE
Effect of emtine treatment on RNA expression  and stablization of RNA otherwise degraded by NMD pathway in head and neck cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data shows the effect of NMD inhbition on cell  lines  and the change in RNA transcripts. The data also shows comparison of non-transformed cells (tert kert) to a Head and Neck tumorigenic cell line SCC12.

DESIGN
Cell lines were treated with emetine at 100 microgm /ml for 8 hours and RNA isolated and analyzed by Affymetrix HG-U133A chip for change in RNA expression.

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
