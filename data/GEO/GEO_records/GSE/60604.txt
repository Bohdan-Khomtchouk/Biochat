TITLE
An alternative pluripotent state confers interspecies chimaeric competency [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that by simple modulation of extrinsic signaling pathways, a new class of pluripotent stem cells, referred to as region selective epiblast stem cells (rsEpiSCs), could be efficiently derived from different stages of the early embryo. rsEpiSCs share features of primed pluripotency yet are distinct from EpiSCs in their molecular characteristics and ability to colonize post-implantation embryos. We performed ChIP-seqencing experiments using antibodies against H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, comparing conventional EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs, as well as comparing conventional human H1 ESCs and human H1 ESCs cultured in mouse rsEpiSCs based culture conditions (H1 rsESCs).

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27me3) in 2 pluripotent stem cell types in mouse and human.
