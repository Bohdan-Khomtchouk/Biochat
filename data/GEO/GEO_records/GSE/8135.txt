TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus treated with rhein

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens in humans and animals, multiply resistant strains are increasingly widespread, new agents are needed for the treatment of S. aureus. Rhein, a natural plant product, has potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. We employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChipsTM arrays to investigate the global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 treated with rhein. Results provided insight into mechanisms involved in rhein - Staphylococcus aureus interactions. Keywords: rhein response

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed for 45 minutes to rhein at concentration of 8 µg/ml (1/2× MIC), 6 samples including 3 control samples are analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
