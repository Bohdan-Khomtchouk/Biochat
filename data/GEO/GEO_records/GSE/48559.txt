TITLE
Identification of MAX signature on MAX deficient SCLC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To development our gene expression approach, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes  potentialy regulated by the transcription factor MAX.Human SCLC cell lines waere analyzed for mutations at the MAX locus. Those cell lines that were found mutated in MAX and showed no MAX protein expression were used as a models to restore the expression of MAX transcription factor, and Identify MAX signature on Human  SCLC.

DESIGN
Human SCLC cell lines were hybridyzed in the following manner according for different conditions (Mock -Ã˜, MAX, shBRG1, MAX-shBRG1): 3 different biological samples for Mock, 3 different biological samples for MAX, 3 different samples for shBRG1 and 3 replicates of the same sample for MAX-shBRG1.
