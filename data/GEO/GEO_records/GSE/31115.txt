TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of 53 tissue samples from germ-free and conventionally raised mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole-transcriptome survey of gene expression differences between germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. To assess the role of toll-like receptor signalling, both wild-type and Myd88 -/- mice were used.

DESIGN
Three different tissues were harvested from 20 mice (5 WT CONV-R, 5 Myd88 -/- CONV-R, 4 WT GF, 6 Myd88 -/- GF) and expression profiles were determines using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
