TITLE
Expression data from fetal and adult  mouse liver mesothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterization and Functional Analyses of Hepatic Mesothelial Cells in Mouse Liver Development. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in mesothelial cells during mouse liver development.

DESIGN
Mouse liver mesothelial cells  were selected by a cell sorter at E12.5 and adult for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We obtained PCLP1+ cells and Mesothelin+ cells at each developmental stage in order to analyze expression profiles of mesothelial cells.
