TITLE
Genome wide transcriptomic analysis of sarcomatoid (E/S), rhabdoid (E/R) and non-sarcomatoid (E*) clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An analysis of the biphasic epithelioid (E-) and sarcomatoid(S-) components of sarcomatoid RCC and advanced stage non-sarcomatoid RCC (E*) showed that: the E- and S- components shared a similar transcriptomic signature, despite morphologic differences; and that the transcriptome of sarcomatoid RCC was sharply distinct from non-sarcomatoid RCC.  The E- and R- components of rhabdoid RCC were also transcriptomically similar but distinct from RCC lacking rhabdoid/sarcomatoid features (E*).

DESIGN
Total RNA processed and spotted on Illumina microarrays from the following patient samples: 38 sarcomatoid RCC (37 paired E- and S and 1 unpaired S-), 4 rhabdoid RCC (paired E- and R-) and 56 non-sarcomatoid RCC.  There are 8 replicate samples (7 sarcomatoid RCC and 1 rhabdoid RCC).
