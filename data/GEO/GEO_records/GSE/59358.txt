TITLE
Microarray analysis of differential gene expression of whole testis extracts from transgenic Musashi-2 and transgenic Musashi-1 over-expression mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of testis-specific over-expression of Musashi-1 and Musashi-2 at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that testis-specific over-expression of Musashi-1/Musashi-2 would result in differential gene expression profiles from the Wildtype control. Results provide important information of the genes affected by Musashi-2 overexpression during spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from whole adult testis of transgenic testis-specfic Musashi-1 and Musashi-2 overexpression mice compared to Wildtype (control) littermates. 4 replicates, 16 samples, 2 comparisons: Wt (Musashi-1) vs. TgMsi1 & Wt (Musashi-2) vs. TgMsi2

PLATFORM
