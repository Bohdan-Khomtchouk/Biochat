TITLE
Chimeric RNA profiling demonstrates an association of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with specific stages of normal myogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA extracted from differentiated mesenchymal stem cells at four time points (T1,T2,T3,T4) and sequenced using Illumina Hi-seq 2000 platform to generate RNA sequencing with 101bp in read length. Nearly 50 million raw reads were yielded from each sample respectively. We used FastQC to confirm the quality of raw fastq sequencing data, and SOAPfuse software to detect fusion transcripts.

DESIGN
Discovering fusion genes from muscle differentiated mesenchymal stem cells
