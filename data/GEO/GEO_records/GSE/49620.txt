TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of adaptation to high glucose concentration in Zymomonas mobilis

ORGANISM
Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 = ATCC 31821

SUMMARY
High glucose concentrations were desirable for ethanol fermentation of Zymomonas mobilis, but it can lead to decrease in ethanol production and productivity. Sorbitol as a compatible solute can be absorbed or synthesized to counteract the detrimental osmotic stress caused from external high glucose concentrations by Z. mobilis. Currently, molecular mechanisms of tolerance to high glucose concentrations and sorbitol promoting ethanol fermentation are still unclear for Z. mobilis. To better understand mechanisms with which high concentrations of glucose and sorbitol affect physiology and metabolism of Z. mobilis ATCC31821 (ZM4), the global transcriptional responses of ZM4 to the challenge of high glucose concentration and sorbitol were profiled using whole genome microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis was performed using twelve independent microarray experiments (four time point reactions × three biological replicates), representing four patterns of growth conditions  from ZM4 cultures. Each microarray measures the expression level of 1,918 genes from ZM4 ATCC31821 and the associated plasmids, with three-fold technical redundancy.
