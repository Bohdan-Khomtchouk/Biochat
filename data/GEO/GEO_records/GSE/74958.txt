TITLE
Generation of Patient-Matched Malignant and Normal Primary Cell Cultures from Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of de novo-derived ccRCC cell cultures and their matching parental tumours.  VHL-mutant and VHL wild-type cultures were established by isolating CA9+ and CA9- cells from tumor samples using FACS.

DESIGN
RNASeq expression profiling of 18 renal cell carcinoma samples, including 6 patient tumours, 6 VHL mutant and 6 VHL WT derivative cell cultures

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
