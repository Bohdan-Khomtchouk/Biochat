TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone variant H3.3 occupancy in zebrafish cardiomyocytes [H3K27Ac]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report high-throughput profiling of acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 from whole zebrafish ventricles. The H3K27Ac mark has been shown to be present at active enhancer elements and including regions of active chromatin. We profile H3K27Ac in uninjured cardiomyocytes and those undergoing regeneration 14 days after genetic ablation. This study provides a framework for understanding chromatin transitions during adult models of regeneration.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27Ac occupancy in uninjured cardiomyocytes and those undergoing regeneration 14 days after genetic ablation
