TITLE
Human blood monocyte response to IL-17A in culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The levels of IL-17 are elevated in the serum of psoriasis patients. However, the effects of IL-17 on circulating leukocytes bearing the IL-17 receptors are not fully understood. Of particular interest are monocytes, as the activation and recruitment of effector monocytes underlies the pathobiology of a number systemic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis co-morbidities, such as atherosclerosis, metabolic regulation in adipose tissue and psoriatic arthritis.  Human monocytes highly express both IL-17RA and IL-17RC and chemotraffick in response to IL-17. We explored the impact of IL-17 on blood monocytes. Using cDNA microarray, , we molecularly characterized how human blood monocytes respond to IL-17A in vitro.

DESIGN
total RNA was extratced from CD14+ monocytes (isolated from human blood) after 24hr culture with or without IL-17A (200ng/mL)

GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
