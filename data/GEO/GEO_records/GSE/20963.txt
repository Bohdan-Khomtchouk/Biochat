TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dental follicle cells after 7 days of differentiation in vitro with BMP2, IGF2 and dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression profiles in dental follicle cells after 7 days of osteogenic differentiation with different inducers.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental follicle cells after 7 days of differentiation with dexamethasone, BMP2, IGF2 and for control with standard cell culture medium
