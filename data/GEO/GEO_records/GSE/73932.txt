TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of murine lungs after treatment with vector to deplete endogenous miRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the impact of AdV-VP55 mediated degredation of host miRNAs on the murine whole lung transcriptome profile

DESIGN
Non-replicateive Adeno vectors were delivered intranasally to 6-8 week old C57BL/6 mice for 48hrs. Whole lung tissue was isolated and used for transcriptome profiling.
