TITLE
G0S2 functions as a tumor supressor through represssion of Myc signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparions on gene expression in murine embyonic fibroblasts (MEFs) wild-type vs G0S2 null MEFs

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from spontanously immortalized MEF cell line E2 from wild-type C57BL/6 mice (E2) and spontaneously immortalized MEF cell line E6 from G0S2 knockout C57BL/6 mice; MEF lines were used at passage number 10-12
