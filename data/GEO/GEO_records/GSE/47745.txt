TITLE
Expression data from intestine of HDAC1 and HDAC2 conditionally mutated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acetylation and deacetylation of histones and other proteins depend on the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), leading to either positive or negative gene expression changes. The use of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) has uncovered a role for HDACs in the control of proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation. However, little is known of the roles of specific HDACs in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). We investigated the consequences of ablating both Hdac1 and Hdac2 in murine IECs gene expression. HDAC1 and HDAC2 conditionally mutated mice were provided by Dr EN Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (Montgomery et al., 2007). Floxed HDAC1 and HDAC2 mice were crossed with villin-Cre transgenic mice to insure specific intestinal epithelial cell gene deletion (Madison et al., 2002).

DESIGN
Total RNAs from the colon of three control and three HDAC1/2 IEC-specific knockout mice were isolated with the Rneasy kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada).
