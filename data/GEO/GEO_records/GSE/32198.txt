TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood - blood draws at Pre and Post time points of Methacholine (MCh) inhalation challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluate the effect of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction on the peripheral whole-blood transcriptome, post-challenge compared to pre-challenge. Blood was collected immediately prior to, and two hours after challenge.

DESIGN
28 total blood samples (14 Pre- and 14 Post-challenge) were analyzed. Robust regression in the Linear Models for MicroArrays (LIMMA) was used to compaire gene expression between Pre and Post time points. No pre-filtering of probe sets was performed prior to statistical analyses. In addtion, and FDR of 10% was used to deteremine signifance of genes.
