TITLE
yeast wt-matA pool

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Contains a collection of wildtype matA Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for estimating the biological variation.

DESIGN
Two channel microarrays were used. RNA isolated from a large amount of wt yeast from a single culture was used as a common reference. Two independent cultures were hybridized on two separate microarrays.
