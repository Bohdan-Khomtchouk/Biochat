TITLE
MMP103

ORGANISM
Methanococcus maripaludis

SUMMARY
Methanococcus maripaludis is a methanogenic Archaea that conserves energy from molecular hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide to methane. Chemostat grown cultures limited for phosphate or leucine were compared to determine the regulatory response to leucine limitation. Keywords: archaea, hydrogen, leucine, phosphate, nutrient limitation, growth rate, methanogen

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of leucine limited cells grown in chemostats were compared to four biological replicates of phosphate limited chemostat cultures. Each comparison was conducted with a dye swap and each contained two copies of the array, yielding 4 technical replicates for each biological replicate. This yielded a total of 16 replicates for the leucine versus phosphate comparisons.
