TITLE
Differential gene expression in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa of the young pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The stomach is often considered a single compartment, but morphological differences among different areas are well known. Oxyntic mucosa (OXY)  is primarily equipped for acid secretion, while it is not enough clear if gastric functional control are shared with other areas. We used microarrays to detail the differential gene expression related to the different gastric part in the young pig.  After slaughtering OXY and pyloric (PYL) mucosa were obtained in 7 already weaned pigs.

DESIGN
The analysis of whole mRNA transcript expression was done by Affymetrix©Porcine Gene 1.1 ST array strips, a Robust Multichip Analysis was performed on the CEL files, and Transcripts ID’s were associated to 13,406 Human gene names, based on Sus scrofa Ensemble
