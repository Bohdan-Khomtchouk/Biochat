TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of each stage of EPCs differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of regulators of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) differentiation at gene expression level. Results provide information of gene expression pattern and critical biological processing during EPCs differentiation. Taken together, we define the network of regulators of cord blood-derived EPCs during EPCs differentiation, which can be used to identify genes involved in vascular pathology. Furthermore, we select the critical regulators and then observe these selected regulator's functionality in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated cord blood-derived EPCs at different time points after the beginning of the EPCs culture under endothelial differentiation condition.
