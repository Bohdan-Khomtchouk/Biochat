TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer stem cell xenografts and their metastatic derivatives

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) line #1 and #4 were grown in either stem cell medium or medium favoring the differentiation. Cells were genetically labeled with fluorescent protein expression cassettes and xenotransplanted into immunocompromised mice, giving rise to tumors. Tumors were explanted, dissociated and kept in culture so as to isolate growing cells. Cells were then sorted for fluorescent protein expression and RNA was extracted. Breast cancer stem (BCSC) and differentiated (dBCCs) cells, grown in opportune conditions, were transfected with lentiviral vector encoding luciferase/enhanced green fluorescent protein (Luc/EGFP-BCSCs) or luciferase/red fluorescent protein (Luc/RFP-dBCCs) reporter genes and orthotopically injected in defined ratios (1:1) into immunocompromised mice. Primary tumor growth and the onset of distant metastases was then observed in time. Following primary and metastatic lesions resection,  labeled dBCCs, BCSCs and metastatic derivatives, thereafter referred to as fat pad differentiated cells (FPD), fat pad stem cells (FPS) and metastases (Ms) respectively, were consequently isolated from through fluorescent-activated cell sorting and RNA extracted.

DESIGN
