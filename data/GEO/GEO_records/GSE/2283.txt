Expression profiling of human primary Expression profiling using a tumor-specific cDNA microarray predicts the prognosis of intermediate risk neuroblastomas. Cancer Cell. 2005 Apr;7(4):337-50. To predict the prognosis of neuroblastoma patients and choose a better therapeutic protocol, we developed a cDNA microarray carrying 5340 genes obtained from primary neuroblastomas and examined 136 tumor samples. We made a probabilistic output statistical classifier that provided a high accuracy in prognosis prediction (89% at 5 years) and a highly reliable method to validate it. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the patients in an intermediate group defined by existing markers are divided by microarray into two further groups with 5 year survivals for 36% and 89% of patients (p < 10(-4)), i.e., with unfavorably and favorably predicted neuroblastomas, respectively. According to these results, we developed a gene subset chip for a clinical tool, for which our classifier exhibited 88% prediction accuracy.
