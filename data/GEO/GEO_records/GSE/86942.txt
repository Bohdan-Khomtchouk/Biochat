TITLE
RNA Splicing of the BHC80 gene Facilitates Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By analysing RNA-sequencing data for a t-NEPC specific RNA splicing signature, we identified a BHC80 splice variant BHC80-2 that functions as a key facilitator for t-NEPC development.

DESIGN
LNCaP cell were overexpressed control, BHC80-1 and BHC80-2 using lenti-virus and cultured in RPMI medium for 48 hours. Total RNA were isolated.
