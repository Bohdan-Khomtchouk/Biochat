TITLE
Gene expression profiling of anterior and posterior palatal tissue from Tgfbr2 mutant mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of TGF-beta signaling in epithelial cells as it pertains to the orientation of muscle fibers in the soft palate during embryogenesis. Here, we first conducted gene expression profiling of the anterior and posterior portions of the palate from wild-type mice. In addition, we also conducted gene expression profiling of the posterior palate in mutant mice with an epithelium-specific conditional inactivation of the Tgfbr2 gene. The latter mice provide a model of submucosal cleft palate, which is a congenital birth defect commonly observed in many syndromic conditions.

DESIGN
To investigate the adverse effects of dysfunctional TGF-Beta signaling on tissue-tissue interaction between the palatal epithelium and myofibers during palatogenesis, we analyzed mice with an epithelial cell-specific conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 (Tgfbr2fl/fl;K14-Cre). We performed microarray analyses of anterior palatal tissue and posterior palatal tissue of E15.5 Tgfbr2fl/fl control mice (n=5, each region), and posterior palatal tissue of Tgfbr2fl/fl;K14-Cre mutant mice, collected at embryonic day 15.5 (n=5). Control samples and mutant samples are from separate litters.
