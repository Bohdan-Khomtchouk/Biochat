TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of anaplastic glioma with or without the mutated IDH1/2 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the NRF2 activity in anaplastic glioma with mutated IDH1/2, we conducted the microarray analysis to measure the expression levels of representative NRF2 target genes, including NQO1, HMOX1, GCLM, TXNRD1, and PRDX1.

DESIGN
12 anaplastic gliomas with or without mutated IDH1/2.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
