TITLE
Evaluation of Estrogen receptor related gene expression in C57BL/6 vs ERKO-alpha and ERKO-beta mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These samples are part of the MMRRC study conducted at UAlbany Keywords: strain comparison

DESIGN
Whole brains from C57BL/6 mice were compared to those from estrogen receptor knockout mice on the same background. Six samples (3 male and 3 female) from each strain (wild type B6, ERalphaKO, ERbetaKO) were compared in this study. These were processed on Affymetrix Mouse 430 plus 2.0 arrays to obtain expression data for each cell ine.
