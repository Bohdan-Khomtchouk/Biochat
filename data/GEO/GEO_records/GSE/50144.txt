TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K27ac, PPARβ/δ and Pol II localization in HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K27Ac is one of the expressed enhancer markers, PPARβ/δ is a transcription factor and Pol II (RNA polymerase II) is an enzyme which catalyzes the transcription of DNA to synthesize precursors of mRNA and most snRNA and microRNA. These genomic localization in endothelial cells is unknown in endothelial cells. This time, we established a new antibody for H3K27ac, PPARβ/δ and Pol II and performed ChIP-seq to identify H3K27ac, PPARβ/δ and Pol II binding site in whole genome manner under PPARβ/δ agonist and/or hypoxia.

DESIGN
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of HUVECs treated with PPARβ/δ agonist (GW501516 100nM) and/or hypoxia (1%O2) for 24hours, then H3K27ac, PPARβ/δ and Pol II binding regions were identified.  Normoxia and DMSO was used as a control condition.  HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.
