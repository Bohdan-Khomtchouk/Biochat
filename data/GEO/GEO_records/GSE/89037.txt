TITLE
Gene expression data from Terminal Effector and Memory Precursor CD8+ T cells during infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of naive T cells into effector and memory populations following infection is mediated by a network of transcription factors (TF) that translate environmental signals into regulatory circuits involving TF expression and binding activity as well as chromatin accessibility. To delineate the transcriptional difference between effector subsets, we performed microarray on TE and MP subsets and found that TE and MP subsets reflect transcriptional differences between effector and memory CD8+ T cells

DESIGN
KLRG1hiCD127lo Terminal Effector and KLRG1loCD127hi Memory Precursor CD8+ T cells were sorted into Trizol at day 8 of Lm-OVA infection. Two or more replicates per sample were analyzed
