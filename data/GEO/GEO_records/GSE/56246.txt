TITLE
Dectin-1-mediated signaling leads to characteristic gene expressions in rat mast cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 was analyzed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Dectin-1-mediated activation and responses of mast cells. Dectin-1-mediated signaling stimulated characteristic gene expression, such as MCP-1, IL-4, IL-13, TNF-Î±and Nfkbiz.

DESIGN
RBL-2H3 cell line stably expressing Dectin-1 was established. Non-stimulated cells (control) compared to Dectin-1-stimulated (Curdlan) cells in order to comfirm Dectin-1-mediated signaling-inducible genes. Dectin-1-stimulated cells compared to Syk inhibitor R406-pretreated cells in order to examine the importance of Syk for Dectin-1-mediated gene up-regulations.
