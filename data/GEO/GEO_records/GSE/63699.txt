TITLE
The expression pattern of microRNAs during the overexpression of cofilin1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen who are the microRNAs that were regulated during the overexpression of actin cytoskeleton depolymerizing protein cofilin1, and we further examine whether the modulation of the key regulator would result in changes of cellular migration or invasion

DESIGN
The tetracycline-induced overexpression of cofilin1 was conducted in HCOXP (H1299 cofilin overexpressed) cells and parental H1299 cells by doxycycline treament. The cells were treated with designated time intervals (2 and 7 days).
