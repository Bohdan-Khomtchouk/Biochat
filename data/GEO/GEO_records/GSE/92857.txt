Expression data from mouse kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal inflammation is an integral part in this pathology.  Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to mitigate renal damage through reduction in blood pressure and reactive oxygen species; however, the exact mechanisms are not clear.  While several studies have underlined the role of epigenetics in renal inflammation and dysfunction, the mechanisms through which epigenetic regulators play role in hypertension are not well defined. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying hypertension in the kidney and how hydrogen sulfide supplementation alleviates these effects.

DESIGN
Wild-type mice were treated with Ang-II to induce hypertension for 28 days along with hydrogen sulfide, at the end of which kidneys were collected and processed for arrays.
