TITLE
Using hESCs to Probe the Interaction of CDKAL1 and MT1E, Two GWAS identified Diabetes Associated Genes

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We report the RNA expression of insulin-GFP+ cells derived from CDKAL1-/- hESCs and CDKAL1-/-hESCs overexpressing MT1E

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in 2 cell types.

PLATFORM
