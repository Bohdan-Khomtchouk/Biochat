TITLE
small RNA from Drosophila melanogaster - adult bodies

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs from imaginal disc / brain, female body and male body. total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH Keywords: small RNA discovery and profiling For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster adult bodies. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt.
