TITLE
Histone variants and modification in T-47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the impact of histone variants and modification on gene regulation, we report high-throughput profiles of six histone markers, H2A.Z, H3K4me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3, by ChIP-Seq in T-47D breast cancer cells. Libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 analyzer for 50 bp paired-end reads and over 20 million uniquely aligned reads were collected for each histone marker.

DESIGN
To examine the impact of histone modification on gene expression regulation in T-47D cells.
