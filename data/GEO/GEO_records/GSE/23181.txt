TITLE
Impeding Xist expression from the active X chromosome improves mouse somatic cell cloning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cloning mammals by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is highly inefficient because of aberrant genomic reprogramming. In addition to random reprogramming errors, we hypothesized the presence of specific errors as evidenced by common anomalies among clones. We found that Xist, which normally inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in females, was ectopically expressed from the active X (Xa) chromosome in cloned mouse embryos of both sexes. Deletion of Xist on Xa normalized global gene expression and produced about a 10-fold increase in cloning efficiency. We also identified an Xist-independent mechanism that specifically downregulated a subset of X-linked genes through somatic-type repressive histone blocks. Thus, we have identified nonrandom reprogramming errors in mouse cloning, which provide promising targets for breakthroughs in SCNT cloning technology.

DESIGN
Gene expression were measured in mouse in vitro fertilized and somatic cell cloned blastocysts. More than three biological replicates were performed in each group using defferent nuclear donor cells.
