TITLE
RNA-sequencing of B cells in the absence of Moz or c-Myb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Humoral responses of mice specifically deleted for Moz (a histone acetyltransferase) or c-Myb (a transcription factor) in B cells were aberrant. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to assess gene expression differences compared to wild-type controls in germinal center B cells or plasmablasts.

DESIGN
Moz f/f Aicda1-Cre, Aicda1-Cre, Myb f/f Cd23-Cre, Mybf/f (no cre) mice were immunized with NP-KLH precipitated in alum and germinal center B cells were sort-purified. Secondary plasmablasts were sort-purified from immunized mice boosted with NP-KLH in PBS (Myb experiment). Two independent experiments were conducted.
