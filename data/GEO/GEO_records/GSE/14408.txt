TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mycobacterial antigen-induced responses in infants vaccinated with BCG at birth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcpripts upregulated by both BCG and PPD were identified in 5 infants and pathway analysis and gene ontology were performed using differentially expressed genes Keywords: response to antigen stimulation

DESIGN
In this study the frozen PBMC of 5 infants were thawed and stimulated for 12 hours with either BCG or PPD or rested in media alone for 12 hours.  The transcripts from the unstimulated PBMC were compared to the PPD and BCG induced transcripts
