TITLE
Characterization of the coding and noncoding transcriptome in undifferentiated and differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA (poly(A)+ fraction) has ben isolated from undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells and from embryonic stem cells induced to differentiate using the hanging drop model, 6 days following iinduction of differentiation. Profiling of the transcritome at these two stages of differentiation using deep RNA sequencing allows identifying modulated coding and noncoding transcripts upon induction of differentiation.

DESIGN
RNA profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells at two stages of differentiation, i.e. undifferntiated state and at day 6 after induction of differentiation. Two conditions, three biological replicates per condition

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
