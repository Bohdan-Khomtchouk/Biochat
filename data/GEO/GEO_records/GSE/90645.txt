TITLE
The impact of SpiB overexpression on gene expression profile in A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SpiB, an Ets family transcription factor, is expressed exclusively in mature B cells, T-cell progenitors, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. To understand the genes regulated by SpiB in epithelial cells, we overexpressed SpiB in lung cancer cell line A549 and examined the change of transcription profile using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v2 Microarray (Agilent Technologies).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, A549-empty vs. A549-SpiB cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 transfected, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
