TITLE
Histone H3 K4,36,79G

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from two replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by histone H3 K4,36,79G mutant. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Comparison of genes whose mRNA levels are affected in a histone H3 K4,36,79G mutant yeast strain compared to wild-type yeast strain.
