TITLE
Antennae transcriptomics of Varroa-hygienic and Nurse/Forager bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
The Varroa mite represents the main threat of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Bees from some colonies can limit the proliferation of this parasite by detecting and removing parasitized brood, such behavior is defined as Varroa sensitive Hygiene (VSH). This is an important issue for selecting colonies that can survive Varroa outbreaks. We therefore study the molecular meachnisms underlying this behavior by comparing the antennae transcriptomic profile of VSH and non-VSH bees. Those profiles were further compared to to the profiles of nurses and forager profiles involved in brood care and food collection, respectively.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of bees performing or not Varroa hygienic behavior (4 replicates) and nurse and forager bees (2-3 replicates)
