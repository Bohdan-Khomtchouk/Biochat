TITLE
Epigenome analysis of irradiated and non-irradiated breast tumor tissue samples and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of irradiated and non-irradiated breast tumor samples and normal control tissue. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip, Genome Build 36  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in breast tumor samples. Samples included 20 non-irradiated tumor samples, 19 irradiated tumor samples and 9 normal controls.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
