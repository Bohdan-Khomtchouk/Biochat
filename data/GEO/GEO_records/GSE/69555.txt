TITLE
Gene expression analyses of miR-99b and miR-330-3p overexpression in Natural killer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to define the targets of two miRNA overexpressed in NK cells in CFS/ME paitents, miRNA precursors for hsa-miR-99b and hsa-miR-330-3p were transfected in to buffy coat derived Natural Killer cells isolated by negative magnetic selection.

DESIGN
Transient transfection of primary natural killer cells with microRNA precursors (hsa-miR-99b and hsa-miR-330-3p). Total RNA was isolated with Trizol 24hrs post transfection, comparison was made between precursor transfected samples and non-sense tranfections
