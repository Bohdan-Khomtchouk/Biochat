TITLE
Gene expression comparison of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and pocR mutant

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression between L. reuteri DSM 17938  and L. reuteri DSM 17938::pocR mutant grown in semi-defined medium after 24h of growth at 37C in anaerobic condition.  PocR is an AraC-like transcriptional regulator, and changes in gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains would indicate genes involved in the PocR regulon.

DESIGN
Includes 3 biological replicates and dye-swaps for DSM 17938  versus pocR mutant. One sample includes total RNA isolated from wildtype DSM 17938 labeled with either cy3 or cy5, and total RNA isolated from the pocR mutant labeled with the opposite dye.  Samples 1, 2, and 3 represent biological replicates.  Samples 4, 5, and 6 represent dye-swaps of the same biological replicates.
