TITLE
Identification of miRNAs and its targets using high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis in male and female Asparagus officinalis.

ORGANISM
Asparagus officinalis

SUMMARY
Two independent small RNA (sRNA) libraries from male and female asparagus plants were sequenced, generating 4.13 and 5.88 million final cleaned reads, respectively. A total of 154 conserved miRNA belonging to 26 families, and 40 novel miRNA candidates that seemed to be specific to asparagus were identified, among them, 63 miRNAs exhibited significant differential expression between male and female plants, and 36 target mRNAs representing 44 conserved and fournovel miRNA in asparagus by high-throughput degradome sequencing analysis.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA in male and female asparagus using high-throughput sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL20875 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Asparagus officinalis)
