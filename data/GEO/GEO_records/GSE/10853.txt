TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Drosophila third instar larvae hemocytes to explain hemocyte development.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We measured gene expression profiles of third instar larvae hemocytes from selected strains related to hemocyte development. Every strain was purchased from commercial companies. And we used microarray data to find what biological processes show abnormalities first, and which gene expressions show similarities and differences between selected strains. Keywords: Strain comparison

DESIGN
200~300 Drosophila third instar larvae hemocytes from each of five lines were dissected to get at least 1 microgram of total RNA. Because all samples were hybridized to single-dye Affymetrix chip, control data were compared with data from each mutant.
