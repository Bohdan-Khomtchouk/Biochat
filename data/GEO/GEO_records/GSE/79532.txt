TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes at 1 day after sexual induction in Fusarium graminearum strains

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. To dissect molecular mechanisms for initial stage of perithecia development, we compared transcriptomes of fungal cultures harvested from F. graminearum wild-type strain Z-3639, abaA, and fpo1 at 1 day after sexual induction.

DESIGN
9 samples examined: Fungal cultures harvested from Fusarium graminearum wild-type strain Z-3639, abaA, and fpo1 at 1 day after sexual induction.

PLATFORM
