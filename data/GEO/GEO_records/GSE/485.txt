TITLE
Genetic basis of sensitivity to pulmonary fibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The murine pulmonary response is strain specific.  Susceptible strains such as C57BL6/J experience an inflammatory response followed by progressive lung disease.  Resistant strains such as Balb/c do not experience significant degrees of inflammation or fibrosis.  This study aims to determine the genetic basis of sensitivity differences between strains Keywords: other
