TITLE
Expression data from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a group of cells which can differentiate to mature endothelial cells in a certain culture condition, and were first isolated from adult human peripheral blood by Asahara et al. in 1997. EPCs have a critical role in the restoration of injured vessel endothelium and the neovascularization in the area of ischemia injury. Recently, the role of androgens in the proliferation, differentiation and adhesion of EPCs is more and more focused. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a kind of unmetabolizable androgen. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of regulated genes in DHT-treated EPCs.

DESIGN
EPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow. Male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks age) mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. For microarray analysis, the cells were grown in culture medium supplemented with 10nmol/L DHT, which was changed on day 2. On day 7, cells was collected for RNA extraction and subsequent experiments.
