TITLE
Gene expression profile of nickel-stimulated HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nickel compounds, important carcinogens and prime inducers of contact allergy in humans, are potent activators of endothelial cells (ECs). To elucidate the signaling pathways mediating the cellular responses to nickel we performed Affymetrix gene profiling of human primary ECs. Keywords: stress response
