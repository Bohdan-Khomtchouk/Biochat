TITLE
Notch1 dose modulates endothelial gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To use RNA-Seq analysis of endothelial cell in various Notch1 alllels in order to determine transcrptional differencesas a consequence of Notch dose. Methods: Using a FACS sorting  we generated high-throughput RNA-SEQ data of endothelials in various Notch1 alleles during development Results: Notch1 dose can alter gene expression in a subset of endothelial genes

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on endothelial cells isolated at e9.5 from embryos with various Notch1 alleles including N1+/+, N1+/-, N1+/vg, N112/vg, N112/-

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
