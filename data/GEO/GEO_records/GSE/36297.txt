TITLE
A PGC-1alpha-dependent decrease in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in muscle of humans with inherited insulin resistance

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess gene expression profiling of 6 patients with a mutation (Arg1174Gln) in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene (INSR) and 10 matched healthy controls

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from skeletal muscle and amplified to biotin-labeled aRNA and hybridized to microarray chips.
