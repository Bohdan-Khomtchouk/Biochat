TITLE
Cotranslational signal independent SRP preloading during membrane targeting

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cotranslational targeting into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) is a key event determining polypeptide fate in eukaryotic cells. Here, we globally define the principles and mechanisms of SRP binding and ER targeting in vivo. Cotranslational targeting through SRP is the dominant route into the ER for all secretory proteins, regardless of targeting signal characteristics. Cytosolic SRP functions in a pioneer translation round that builds a membrane-resident mRNAs pool, explaining how low SRP levels suffice for the secretory load. SRP does not induce an elongation arrest; consequently, kinetic competition between targeting and translation elongation dictates which substrates are translocated post-translationally. Unexpectedly, SRP binds most secretory ribosomal complexes before targeting signals are synthesized. We show non-coding mRNA elements can promote signal-independent SRP pre-recruitment. Our study defines the complex kinetic interplay between elongation and determinants in the polypeptide and mRNA modulating SRP-substrate selection and membrane targeting in vivo.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA-seq of subcellular fractions of ribosomes. Soluble and membrane bound ribosomes are separated by centrifugation, and SRP-bound ribosomes are immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction. Polysomes and monosomes are separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.
