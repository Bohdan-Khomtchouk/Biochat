TITLE
High-resolution mapping of ribosome footprints from Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional gene regulation plays a significant role in the response to oxygen deprivation. Here, we utilized advances in next-generation sequencing technology to examine changes in transcriptional control, mRNA loading on to polysome, and regulation of ribosome activity during mRNA translation in 7-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to 2 hour hypoxia treatment.

DESIGN
14 samples, 2 conditions (2 hr hypoxia and 2 hr normoxia), 2 bioreplicates of 3 RNA pools (total mRNA, immunopurified (TRAP) polysomal mRNA, ribosome footprints), 1 bioreplicate of 1 RNA pool (immunopurified (TRAP)-ribosome footprints).

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
