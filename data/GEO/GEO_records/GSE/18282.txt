TITLE
Role of Cryptococcus neoformans Sre1-pathway in low oxygen gene expression

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Comparison of wild-type serotype A C. neoformans cells grown at 21% and 3% oxygen for 2 hours in rich medium.  Also comparison of wild-type and Sre1-pathway mutant strains grown at 3 % oxygen for 2 hours in rich medium.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment. Each comparison was performed in two biological replicates, each containing duplicate probes/array (=4 data points total per comparison).
