TITLE
Global gene expression profiles in whole blood total RNA from patients with lupus nephritis, before and after initiation of therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are characterized by the spontaneous over-expression of interferon(IFN)-induced genes in peripheral blood RNA samples. In the present study, we wanted to study the evolution of the IFN gene signature in the peripheral blood of patients with lupus nephritis, before and after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Strikingly, we found that immunosuppressive therapy did not strongly reduce the expression of IFN-induced genes in patients who responded to therapy, as indicated by decreased general and renal indices of disease activity. By contrast, the IFN gene signature decreased in patients developing renal failure.

DESIGN
Global gene expression studies were performed in serial whole blood samples from SLE patients with a renal BILAG A prior to, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of conventional immunosuppressive therapy (induction with high-dose corticosteroids, IV cyclophosphamide or oral mycophenolate during the first 3 months, followed by maintenance with moderate- to low-dose corticosteroids, azathioprine or mycophenolate). The expression of IFN-induced genes was analyzed, in comparison to global and renal indices of disease activity.
