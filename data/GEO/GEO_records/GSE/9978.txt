TITLE
Genes plus and minus LIF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken in order to characterize the functions of Rex-1 and identify potential Rex-1 target genes.Both alleles of the Rex-1 gene were disrupted in J1 mouse embryonic stem cells. Gene expression levels in one of the resulting Rex-1 knockout cell lines was compared to that of J1 wild type cells. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Gene expression in Rex-1 knockout mouse embryonic stem cells compared to that of J1 wild type cells. Cells were cultured in the presence and absence of LIF. This series utilized eight samples.There are two biological replicates per cell type cultured under this condition. The J1 samples serve as the control.
