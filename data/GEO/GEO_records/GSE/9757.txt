Response to estradiol-ERalpha

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In addition to the estrogen responsive element (ERE)-dependent gene expression, E2-ERalpha regulates transcription through functional interactions with transfactors bound to their cognate regulatory elements on DNA, hence the ERE-independent signaling pathway.  However, the relative importance of the ERE-independent pathway in E2-ERalpha signaling is unclear.  Our studies in infected ER-negative cell models with an ERalpha demonstrated that genomic responses assessed by microarrays from the  alter cellular growth, death or motility.
