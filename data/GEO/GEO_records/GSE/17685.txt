TITLE
Gene expression profile in selenophosphate synthetase 1 (SPS1) knockdown Drosophila SL2 cell

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Selenophosphate, which is the active donor of selenium in selenocysteine (Sec) biosynthesis is synthesized from selenite and ATP by an enzyme designated as selenophosphate synthetase (SPS).There are two isoforms of SPS in higher eukaryotes,SPS1 and SPS2. Initially, both SPS1 and SPS2 were thought to be involved in selenophosphate synthesis. However, it was subsequently shown that only SPS2 catalyzes selenophosphate synthesis. Although SPS1 is an essential gene in Drosophila, its function has not been determined. To identify transcriptional profile of SPS1 knockdown cells, which could offer valuable clues to identify molecular mechanism of SPS1, we introduced RNAi using its cognate double-stranded RNA into Drosophila SL2 cells, and then microarray analysis was carried out.

DESIGN
In order to find primary or secondary target gene which is regulated by SPS1,Drosophila SL2 cells were harvested at day1, day3 and day5 after SPS1 knockown for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
