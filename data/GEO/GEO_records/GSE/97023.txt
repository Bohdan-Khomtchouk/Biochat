TITLE
Expression profiling of colorectal cancer cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed genome-wide expression analyses as part of a multi-omics study on 34 colorectal cancer cell lines. The data were used for gene expression subtyping of cell lines, gene set analyses and integration with DNA and protein level data.

DESIGN
There are 34 colorectal cancer cell lines included in the study. All 34 samples were analyzed on Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 Arrays.
