TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients in secondary prevention of CVD taking placebo, grape extract or resveratrol-enriched grape extract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in PBMCs isolated from male patients ongoing secondary prevention of CVD to determine significant modulatory effects that may have been induced by the intake of an initial dose of 8 mg of resveratrol-enriched grape extract for 6 months and then, 16 mg for a further 6 months.

DESIGN
The aim of this work was to determine whether the daily intake of dietary levels of resveratrol (RES) for a total of 12 months exerted any modulatory effects, at the level of gene expression, in PBMCs isolated from patients in secondary prevention of CVD. Male patients were divided in 3 groups: placebo (A), grape extract (B) and resveratrol-enriched grape extract (C). Total RNA was extracted from isolated PBMCs belonging to a total of 18 diabetic male patients (6 from each group) in 3 time points (at day 0, after 6 months and after 12 months) to compare differential gene expression between the groups. Differential gene expression after 6 and 12 months of the study for each group: placebo (A), grape extract (B) and resveratrol-enriched grape extract (C)
