TITLE
c-Maf-dependent transcripts in effector Tregs from Peyer's patches

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify c-Maf as an essential factor regulating adoption of RORgamma t+ and T follicular regulatory phenotypes in effector Tregs. Differential expression analysis demonstrates reduced signatures of both ROR gamma t+ Tregs and T follicular regulatory cells following regulatory T cell-specific c-Maf deletion.

DESIGN
Differential expression analysis of Peyer's patch effector Tregs (CD4+FoxP3+CD62L-) from 13-week old Maf+/+FoxP3-YFP-cre or Mafflox/floxFoxP3-YFP-cre mice, performed in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
