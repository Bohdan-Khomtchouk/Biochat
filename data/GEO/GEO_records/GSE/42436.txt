TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling in Malawian patients with acute hypersensitivity reactions to Nevirapine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a class of antiretroviral drug, used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite its wide use, nevirapine treatment has been associated with a significant incidence of different kind of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). We used microarrays to find significant genes that can relate to Nevirapine-persuaded hypersensitivity reactions in ‘acute’ patients compared to ‘recovered’ and/or ‘tolerant’ patients.

DESIGN
We have selected 18 patients’ samples, 6 from each group (Acute, Recovered, Tolerant) to investigate Nevirapine induced hypersensitivity reactions using transcriptomic profiling based on microarray technology. Acute:Patient taking nevirapine develops adverse drug reaction (ADR). Recovered: 6 weeks after acute reaction-not longer taking nevirapine. Tolerant: Patient on neviraoine and tolerating treatment.
