TITLE
Networks of cultured iPSC-derived neurons reveal the human synaptic activity-regulated adaptive gene program

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the synaptic activity-regulated gene expression response in the human genetic background using cultured human iPSC-derived (hiPSCd) neuronal networks and networks of hiPSCd neurons mixed with mouse primary neurons. Our results confirm that genetic changes affect the synaptic activity-regulated gene program, proposing a functional mechanism how they have driven evolution of human cognitive abilities.

DESIGN
We compared RNA profiles of untreated hiPSCd neurons and hiPSCd neurons treated with bicuculline and 4-aminopyridine for 1 or 4 hours. Samples were collected from hiPSCd neuron-only cultures and from co-cultures of hiPSCd neurons and mouse primary hippocampal neurons.
