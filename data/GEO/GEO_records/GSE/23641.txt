TITLE
Expression data of wild type and miR-155 knockout bone marrow derived dendritic cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to look at overall gene expression differences between miR-155-/- and WT dendritic cells under inflammatory conditions.

DESIGN
Bone marrow from either wild type or miR-155-/- C57Bl/6 mice was differentiated into dendritic cells by incubating with GM-CSF.  These cells were then stimulated with LPS, and gene expression was performed.
