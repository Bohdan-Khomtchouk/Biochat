TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Enterococcus faecalis to iron excess

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
To further investigate the homeostatic response of E. faecalis to Fe exposure, we examine the whole-genome transcriptional response of wild-type (WT) exposed to non toxic Fe excess. This experiment correspond the work titled Transcriptomic response of Enterococcus faecalis to iron excess (work in preparation)
