TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Enterococcus faecalis to iron excess

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
To further investigate the homeostatic response of E. faecalis to Fe exposure, we examine the whole-genome transcriptional response of wild-type (WT) exposed to non toxic Fe excess. This experiment correspond the work titled Transcriptomic response of Enterococcus faecalis to iron excess (work in preparation)

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from four separate wild-type cultures of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF, two controls samples  (N medium growth) and two iron samples (N medium gowth with 0.5 mM Fe-NTA).  Each chip measures the expression level of 3,114 genome genes from Enterococcus faecalis strain V583 (A7980-00-01).
