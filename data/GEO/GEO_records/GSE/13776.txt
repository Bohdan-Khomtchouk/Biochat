TITLE
Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 expression in liquid basal medium or glucose-, chitin-, or tomato plant-containing media

ORGANISM
Trichoderma harzianum

SUMMARY
Trichoderma harzianum CECT 2413 expression in liquid basal medium and in the presence of glucose, chitin or tomato plants.

DESIGN
Four different experimental conditions were carried out: basal (MS), glucose (MS-G), chitin (MS-Q) and tomato plant (MS-P). Two biological replicates were analyzed by microarray for each experimental condition. Three independent cultures of mycelium were pooled for each biological replicate.

PLATFORM
