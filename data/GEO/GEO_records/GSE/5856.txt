TITLE
Targets of pharmacological histone deacetylase inhibition in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have previously reported the paradoxical downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3) steady-state mRNA by pharmacological histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. This microarray experiment was designed to identify novel targets of an HDAC inhibitor (trichostatin A (TSA), 500 nM, 24h, Sigma) in primary human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC). Keywords: gene expression profiling, paired samples, dichotomous conditions

DESIGN
HUVEC were isolated and cultured from three individuals (n=3, biological replicates). Paired samples were then treated with TSA (500nM, 24h, Sigma) or a vehicle-control. After sample preparation, hybridization to Affymetrix Human Genome Focus Arrays, image acquisition and the evaluation of several quality control metrics, summary expression measures were computed using the MAS5.0, RMA and GCRMA pre-processing strategies, respectively. The values were generated using the affy and gcrma packages of the Bioconductor Project.
