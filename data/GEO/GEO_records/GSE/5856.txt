TITLE
Targets of pharmacological histone deacetylase inhibition in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We and others have previously reported the paradoxical downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3) steady-state mRNA by pharmacological histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. This microarray experiment was designed to identify novel targets of an HDAC inhibitor (trichostatin A (TSA), 500 nM, 24h, Sigma) in primary human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVEC). Keywords: gene expression profiling, paired samples, dichotomous conditions
