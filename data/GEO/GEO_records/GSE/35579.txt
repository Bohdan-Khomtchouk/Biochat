TITLE
050209-miRNA Melanoma miRNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify improved molecular markers to support histological examination we used microarray analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples from different stages of melanomagenesis to identify differentially expressed microRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from isolated 19 human cell lines and 52 FFPE  human samples. Cells include 2 immortalised melanocytes, 4 ovarian cancer cell lines and 13 melanoma cell lines. 61 FFPE samples include 11 benign naevi, 20 primary and 21 metastatic melanoma
