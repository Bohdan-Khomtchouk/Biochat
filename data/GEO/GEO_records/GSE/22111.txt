TITLE
The Atoh1 targetome in murine postnatal cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A relatively small number of proneural transcription factors specify a multitude of neural progenitor populations in the developing mammalian brain. Despite their importance, little is known about their targets, cellular processes they regulate, or what genomic sites they occupy in vivo. We used an integrated experimental and computational approach, combining RNA-seq, Histone-seq, and Atoh1 ChIP-seq in cerebellar tissue, to identify over 600 targets of Atoh1, an important developmental transcription factor. We validated 10% of these targets and found that Atoh1 directly regulates genes involved not only in early proliferation but also later differentiation, migration, cell adhesion, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization by recognizing a novel 10 nucleotide Atoh1 E-Box associated motif (AtEAM). This Atoh1 “targetome” is not only a resource for studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in cerebellar development, but our integrated approach provides a framework for future in vivo studies of transcription factors and their targetomes.

PLATFORM
