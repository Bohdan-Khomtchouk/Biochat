TITLE
Gene expression in human umbilical cord endothelial cells following FoxP1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To search for genes regulated by the transcription factor Forkhead box Protein P1 (FoxP1)  in endothelial cells, we transfected human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) with a combination of three siRNA oligonucleotides directed against human FoxP1 . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from donated umbilical cords, pooled from two donors and cultivated up to passage 5. For transfection with FoxP1-siRNA cells were cultured to 70% confluence and transfected with a combination of three FoxP1-targeting siRNAs or an irrelevant control oligonucleotide (all from invitrogen) using Lipofectamin RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Total RNA was isolated 48h after transfection.

DESIGN
Three individual samples per condition were analyzed.
