TITLE
Gene expression analysis of rectal mucosa in chronic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to healthy volunteers (HV)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An investigation of gene expression changes in rectal biopsies from donors with IBS compared to controls to begin to understand this complex syndrome. To further investigate differences between IBS groups (constipation and diarrhoea predominant) (part1) and how IBS relates to bacterial infection (part2) with biopsies taken 6 months after Campylobacter jejuni infection.

DESIGN
Part1: 18 Constipation predominant IBS subjects (IBS-C) and 27 diarrhoea predominant IBS subjects (IBS-D) compared to 21 healthy volunteers (HV). Part2: 21 Campylobacter jejuni infection (PIBD, PIBS, PINIBS) compared to 19 healthy volunteers (HV). PIBD = post Campylobacter infection with IBS (within 6 months) PIBS = post infection IBS (unknown time point and organism) PINIBS = post Campylobacter infection with no resulting IBS
