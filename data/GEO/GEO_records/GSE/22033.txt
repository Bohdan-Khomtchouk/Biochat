TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by the phosphotylation of PPARgamma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the molecular mechanisms of PPARgamma phosphorylation at Set273, we generated cell-lines of PPARgamma KO MEFs expressing wtPPARgamma or S273APPARgamma. In addition, because our data showed that PPARgamma ligand drugs such as rosiglitazone and MRL24 blocked this phopshorylation, we treated cells with these drugs, then prepared RNA samples to look at the gene profiling.

DESIGN
PPARgamma KO MEFs were introduced by wtPPARgamma or S273APPARgamma. Cells were differentiated for 6 days. Then, wtPPARgamma-introduced KO MEFs were treated with either 1 uM rosiglitazone or 1uM MRL24 for 24h. Cells were harvested and we purified total RNA samples.
