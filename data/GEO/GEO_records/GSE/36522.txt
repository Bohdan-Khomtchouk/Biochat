TITLE
Transcriptome of chronic myeloid leukemia blood in early disease based on RNA-seq method

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to support our research of chronic myeloid leukemia in human genome, we conducted massively parallel pyrosequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) using chronic myeloid leukemia blood in early disease. We obtained a total of 17.74 million read pairs from blood in early disease.The RNA-seq data derived from the sample illustrated the expreesion genes in chronic myeloid leukemia blood in early disease of human.

DESIGN
1 sample examined: blood in early disease.
