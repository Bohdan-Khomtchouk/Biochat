TITLE
Cilia-dependent GLI processing in neural crest cells is required for tongue development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the RNA profiles of both control and Kif3a f/f; Wnt1-Cre mandibular prominences of the murine face at  embryonic day E11.5. We sought to determine the gene expression changes which occurr in the mandibular prominence when primary cilia are lost on neural crest cells.

DESIGN
The mandibular prominence from 10 control e11.5 embryos were collected and pooled, and 10 mutant e11.5 embryos were collected and pooled. RNA-seq was performed on these samples.
