TITLE
Fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 and leukocyte Ig-like receptor B2 LILRB2 are prognostic biomarkers in septic shock

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sepsis is a major health concern, with high morbidity and mortality workdwide. In order to identify prognostic biomarkers in septic shock patients, we performed a microarray study exploring the early modulation of gene expression according to day 28 mortality. Several candidate biomarkers including CX3CR1 and LILRB2 were identified as prognostic biomarkers.

DESIGN
51 septic shock patients and 22 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Septic shock patients were sampled twice, at admission, and a second time at D2 or D3. Admission samples from septic shock patients were compared to healthy volunteers, and according to day 28 survival status. Modulation of gene expression between the 2 time points was also analyzed according to day 28 survival.
