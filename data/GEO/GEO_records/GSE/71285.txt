TITLE
Gene expression in E10.5 Maxillary Arch Mesenchyme from control and Lhx6-/-;Lhx8-/- mutant embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used laser capture microdissection to isolate maxillary arch mesenchyme from E10.5 embryos.  This tissue was collected from both control (3x) and Lhx6-/-;Lhx8-/- mutant (3x) samples. Transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
The mutant mice are of mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J, 129 and CD-1 strains.  The head of E10.5 embryos was collected and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature resin (Tissue-Tek) by flash freezing on dry ice. The frozen sections were collected on polyethylene naphthalate membrane slides (Leica). Leica LMD6000 Laser Micro-Dissection System was used to cut out the normal expression domain of Lhx6 and Lhx8 in the maxillary arch mesenchyme. The tissue was collected from the entire antero-posterior extent of the maxillary arches. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Subsequent steps of transcriptional profiling were performed by the New York University Genome Technology Center, beginning with the amplification of RNA by Ovation Nano Amplification system (NuGen). RNA samples from three wild-type and three Lhx6−/−;Lhx8−/− mutant embryos, all somite count- and sex-matched (females), were analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. A list of Lhx-regulated genes were generated from the microarray result based on the following criteria: fold change in the average expression between wild types and Lhx6−/−;Lhx8−/− mutants is > 1.5, the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05) and the average intensity of the probe signal is > 100 for wild-type and/or mutant samples. The resulting list of 212 genes was used for a gene ontology analysis with DAVID (27,28).
