TITLE
Molecular Mechanisms of Early Response in Adaptive Cerebral Arteriogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study aims at a comprehensive understanding of the genomic program activated during early-phase of collateral vessel growth in a rat model for cerebral adaptive arteriogenesis (3-VO). While arteriogenesis constitutes a promising therapeutic concept for cerebrovascular ischemia, genomic profiles essential for therapeutic target identification were analysed solely for collateral arteries of the heart and periphery. Despite challenging anatomical conditions of the brain the 3-VO model allows identification of differentially expressed genes during adaptive cerebral arteriogenesis by selective removal of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Keywords: early response time course, selective collateral growth, brain

DESIGN
Using an established rat model of nonischemic cerebral hypoperfusion (3-VO) (Busch, Buschmann; 2003), RNA was extracted from isolated ipsilateral PCA. Pooled RNAs from groups of intact (0h), sham and 3-VO animals 24h and 3 days after surgery, were hybridised repeatedly for an extensive genome screen of 15866 genes applying standardized Affymetrix technology. For each Array total RNA from 8 animals was processed, pooled and hybridized to a Rat230A GeneChip per group. These groups were classified as follows: intact control (N=3), 24h3VO (N=3); 24h sham (N=3), 3days3VO (N=3); and 3days sham(N=3). Hybridization, washing, antibody amplification, staining, and scanning of probe arrays were performed according to the Affymetrix Technical Manual. Probe arrays were scanned using the GeneChip System (Hewlett-Packard, Santa Cruz, CA)(Affymetrix) and raw data were processed using GCOS and normalized to a global intensity of 500.
