TITLE
Gene expression analysis of pre-metastatic lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The immune system sustains inflammation, and can occasionally inhibit tumor development. Conversely, chronic inflammation positively contributes to the development of cancer. Furthermore, it was revealed that the large number of macrophages and haematopoietic progenitor cells accumulate in response to primary tumors in pre-metastatic lungs. However, the relationship between the inflammation-like state induced by primary tumors in pre-metastatic phase and the migration of tumor cells in metastasis is not well understood. Here we analyzed transcriptional change of the lungs by pre-metastatic stimuli. Keywords: Gene expression analysis of pre-metastatic lungs

DESIGN
We examined the lungs derived from mice that had been injected with tumor cells into the back subcutaneously. This model mimics pre-metastatic lungs responding to a primary tumor before tumor cells reach the lungs.
