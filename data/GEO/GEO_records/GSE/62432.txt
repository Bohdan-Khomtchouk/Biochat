TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of self-organized, in vitro generated optic tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem (ES) cells have a remarkable capacity to self-organize complex, multi-layered optic cups in vitro via a culture technique called SFEBq. During both SFEBq and in vivo optic cup development, Rax (Rx) expressing neural retina epithelial (NRE) tissues utilize Fgf and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways to differentiate into neural retina (NR) and retinal-pigmented epithelial (RPE) tissues, respectively. How these signaling pathways affect gene expression during optic tissue formation has remained largely unknown, especially at the transcriptome scale.

DESIGN
We generated Day 10 Rx+ optic tissue using SFEBq, exposed these tissues to either Fgf or Wnt/β-catenin stimulation, and assayed their gene expression at Days 12 and 15 using RNA-Seq. We measured gene expression in these 5 sample groups in biological triplicate using RNA-seq (Illumina HiSeq) .
