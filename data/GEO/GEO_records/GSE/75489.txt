TITLE
Determination of a comprehensive alternative splicing regulatory network and the combinatorial regulation by key factors during Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition [ESRP KD]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial specific splicing regulatory protein 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2) are important regulators of alternative splicing during EMT. To study the alternative splicing events regulated by ESRP1/2 at a genome wide scale, we used lentiviral shRNAs to knockdown ESRP1/2 in H358 cells and performed RNA-seq in biological triplicates.

DESIGN
We used lentiviral based shRNAs targeting ESRP1 and ESRP2 to knockdown both regulators in human H358 cells. We harvested total RNA and protein from ESRP1/2 knockdown and control knockdown in biological triplicates. We made cDNA libraries for each replicate and subjected them to RNA-seq.
