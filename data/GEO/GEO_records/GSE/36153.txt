TITLE
Expression profiles of primary cortical neurons after knocking down Fus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the functional properties of FUS, we established the differentially expressed alternative exons in FUS-silenced primary cortical neurons by using exon-sensitive microarray technology.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of primary cortical neuron infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA against mouse Fus or control. RNA was harvested 11 days after transfection.
