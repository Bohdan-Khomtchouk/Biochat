TITLE
Mapping of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by selective chemical labeling (SCL-seq) in human naive B cells and in vitro differentiated plasmablasts (P1 cells) [HTS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide mapping of 5hmC in naive B cells and in vitro differentiated plasmablasts (P1 cells). In addition, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histne marks were mapped in in vitro differentiated plasmablasts from two healthy donors (BN358 and BN369) by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from human primary cells was extracted and submitted to the SCL protocol using the Hydroxymethyl Collector kit from Active Motif. After sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, reads were mapped to the human hg19 genome. H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were mapped in in vitro differentiated plasmablasts (P1 cells) by ChIP-seq.
