TITLE
Survey of cryptic unstable transcripts in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We sequenced both the stable (WT) and unstable (rrp6delta) transcriptomes of three S.cerevisiae strains: S288c, Σ1278b, JAY291 and the S.paradoxus strain N17 for de novo annotation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs).  Doing so we have greatly expanded on previous CUTs which were limited to the S.cerevisiae strain S288c and have provided the first assessment of CUT expression conservation in yeast

DESIGN
Examination of polyadenylated RNA populations between wildtype and nuclear exosome mutant rrp6delta yeast cells in biological replicates
