TITLE
Gene expression analysis in Fmr1KO mice identifies an immunological signature in brain tissue and mGluR5-related signaling in primary neuronal cultures.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profile of whole tissue and cultured neuronal cells from the hippocampus and cortex from pooled littermate embryos (at 17-18 days post conception) of 2 mouse genotypes C57BL/6 congenic WT and Fmr1 KO.

DESIGN
Fragile X mouse model, whole tissue and cultured neuronal cells from the hippocampus and cortex Pooled whole tissue or cultured cells from the central nervous system of embryonic mouse littermates of 2 genotypes.
