TITLE
Gene expression analysis of developing limbs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate geneexpression profile in developing joints vs adjacent growth plate in control and TGF-beta type II receptor conditional knock-out in limb mesenchyjme

DESIGN
We obtained E14.5 autopods from two normal controls and two Tgfbr2Prx1KO littermate embryos. Samples were frozen in OTC and cryosectioned and subjected to laser-capture microdissection for RNA sampling for interzone, growth plate chondrocytes and interdigital tissue. RNas were subjected to microarray analysis
