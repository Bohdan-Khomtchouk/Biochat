TITLE
Mkx overexpression effect in C3H10T1/2 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of C3H10T1/2 cells overexpressing Mkx. This microarray results show that Mkx has the potential ability to promote differentiation to tendon, ligament and annulus fibrosus cells.

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. RNA samples were obtained from C3H10T1/2, C3H10T1/2 overexpressing Venus and C3H10T1/2 overexpressing Venus-Mohawk.

PLATFORM
