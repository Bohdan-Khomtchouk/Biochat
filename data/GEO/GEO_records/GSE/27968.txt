TITLE
DNA methylation data from AML12 cells during EMT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation during EMT in AML12 cells using comprehensive high throughput arrays for relative methylation (CHARM). We used custom Nimblegen microarrays.

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from cells at different timepoints post-TGF-Î² stimulation and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays). AML12 cells from 4 representative experiments were collected and used for the genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL10680 NimbleGen Mouse 2.1M array [Feinberg_MM8_Me_HX1]
