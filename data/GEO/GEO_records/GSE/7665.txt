TITLE
Stress-dependent dynamics of chromatin remodeling in yeast: Dual roles for SWI/SNF in heat shock stress response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total H4 and acetyl H4 IP, time course Total H4 and acetyl H4 occupancy, Snf2 occupancy, gene expression analysis Keywords: stress response, time course

DESIGN
S cerevisiae were subjected to heat shock and stationary phase stress. The histone occupancy and H4 acetylation levels were monitored in parallel with gene expression studies, and Snf2 occupancy before and after stress.
