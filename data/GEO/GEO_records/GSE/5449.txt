TITLE
The transcriptional changes induced by AtLEJ1 gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The loss-of-function mutant of AtLEJ1 had well-developed anther cells and showed an increased accumulation of JA and ET in its flower bud clusters. Conversely, overexpression of AtLEJ1 caused a delay in the development of the floral organs, arrested anther cell development and secondary cell-wall biosynthesis in the endothecium cells, and reduced JA and ET contents in the flower bud clusters, resulting in male-sterility through anther indehiscence. We used microarrays to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional changes induced by AtLEJ1 gene expression, Keywords: Comparison of transcripts during flower development among 35S:AtLEJ1, atlej1 and wild type.

DESIGN
We performed a full genome microarray analysis (ATH1 Affymetrix chips) with the wild type, 35S:AtLEJ1/5-8 line and atlej1 mutant. Total RNAs were obtained separately from unopened flower buds at stages 1~12, when the anthers are not yet opened, and from open flowers at stages 13~14, when anthesis occurs.
