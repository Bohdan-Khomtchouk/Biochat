TITLE
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 60-mer array protocol setup

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Set up and modification of Agilent standard protocols for a new custom 60-mer array for C. acetobutylicum. Keywords: Test of platform and protocols

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from both C. acetobutylicum ATCC and M5 strains at several points during the exponential phase of growth and the samples for each strain were mixed. Several amounts of labeled material and PMT settings were tested. For the ATCC824 strain the samples were taken at OD (600 nm) = {1.09, 1.8, 2.6, 2.0} whereas for the the M5 strain samples were taken at OD (600 nm) = {0.868, 1.36, 2.40, 3.20,  4.20}. The different amount of materials loaded into the slides were {5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.5} micrograms and the PMT values were {(60,10), (60,20), (80,10), (80,20), (80,40), (100,100)}.
