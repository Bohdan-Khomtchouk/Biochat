TITLE
Expression data from growth plate cartilage of control and immobilized embryonic chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Chicken Gene 1.0 ST Array (ChiGene-1_1-st) profiles were generated from growth plate cartilage derived from the distal femur and proximal tibia of embryonic chickens at three developmental stages (day 12, 13 and 15) corresponding to stages prior to and immediately after the acqusition of mechano-responsive cartilage growth in the femur but not tibia (which does not respond to mechanical stimuli until later stages). Additionally, array profiles were generated from growth plate cartilage from the distal femur and proximal tibia of E15 chicks which were pharmacologically immobilized by decamethonium bromide treatment, which reduces longitudinal growth of the femur only at this stage.

DESIGN
Three developmental stages, two tissue types and two treatments with 3 biological replicates per group.
