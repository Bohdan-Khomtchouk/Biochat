TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and pro1 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that pro1 mutant influence the cell cycle pathway. Results provide important information of the cell cycle-related gene expression level regulation of cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase.

DESIGN
Seedling mRNA profiles of 14DAG wild type (WT) and pro1 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000 (Zea mays).
