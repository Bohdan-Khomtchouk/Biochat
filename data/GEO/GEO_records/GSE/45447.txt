TITLE
Brg1 Modulates Enhancer Activation and Polycomb-mediated Repression in Mesoderm Differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the genome-wide occupancy changes in normal and Brg1-deleted mesoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells of chromatin regulators and histone modifications.

DESIGN
ChIP analysis for BRG1-FLAG, SUZ12, H3K27ac, or H3K27me3 in 2 conditions: Day4 THF (Control) and Day4 4OHT (Brg1-deleted).  2-3 replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
