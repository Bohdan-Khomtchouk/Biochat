TITLE
Disruption of transkingdom communication by antibiotics leads to immune and mitochondrial dysfunction in the gut

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. We analyzed the effects of antibiotics using a popular model of gut microbiota depletion in mice by a cocktail of antibiotics. We combined intestinal transcriptome together with metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota to develop a new bioinformatics approach that probes the links between microbial components and host functions. We found that most antibiotic-induced alterations can be explained by three factors: depletion of the microbiota; direct effects of antibiotics on host tissues; and the effects of remaining antibiotic-resistant microbes. While microbe depletion led to down-regulation of immunity, the two other factors primarily inhibited mitochondrial gene expression and amounts of active mitochondria, and induced cell death. By reconstructing and analyzing a transkingdom network, we discovered that these toxic effects were mediated by virulence/quorum sensing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
