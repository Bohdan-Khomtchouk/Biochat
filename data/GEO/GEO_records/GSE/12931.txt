TITLE
Murine model of gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring a germline Kit K641E oncogenic mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are thought to derive from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) or an ICC precursor. Oncogenic mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT are present in most GIST. KIT K642E was originally identified in sporadic GIST and later found in the germ line of a familial GIST. A mouse model of harboring a germline Kit K641E mutant was created to model familial GIST. The expression profile was investigated in the gastric antrum in the knock-in Kit K641E murine GIST model by microarray.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on antral tissue from three pairs of KitK641E:Neo/K641E:Neo and KitWT/WT  P14 littermates. Antrum labeled RNAs were hybridized to MEEBO arrays containing on average 38784 mouse 70mer oligonucleotide probes (Stanford University, US).

PLATFORM
GPL6943 ULB MEEBO Mouse 39K array version 1
