TITLE
Type-I interferon inducible genes 26 weeks after mCMV infection in Siglec-H wt and Siglec-H ko mice and their non infected controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type I interferons are critical anti-viral cytokines during virus infections and have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The secretion of type I interferon of pDCs is modulated by Siglec-H, a DAP12 associated receptor on pDCs. We showed that Siglec-H deficient pDCs produce more of the type I interferon IFN-α in vitro and that Siglec-H ko mice produce more IFN-α after murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection in vivo, leading to efficient clearance of the virus. Furthermore, ageing Siglec-H ko mice showed a mild form of systemic autoimmunity. In contrast, Siglec-H ko mice developed a severe form of systemic lupus-like autoimmune disease with strong kidney nephritis several weeks after a single mCMV infection. This induction of systemic autoimmune disease after virus infection in Siglec-H ko mice was accompanied by a type I interferon signature and fully dependent on type I interferon signaling. These results show that Siglec-H normally serves as modulator of type I interferon responses after infection with a persistent virus and thereby prevents induction of autoimmune disease.

DESIGN
For microarray experiments gene expression profiles of total splenic cells from two wt and Siglec-H ko mice 26 weeks after infection with luciferase expressing murine Cytomegalovirus (5x105 pfu) or from two uninfected wt and Siglec-H ko control mice were analyzed
