TITLE
Expression data from human cornea epithelial and stromal cells and tissue-engineered anterior lamelar corneas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to analyze gene expression associated to the process of cell and tissue differentiation of bioengineered human anterior lamelar corneas We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression associated to bioengineered corneas differentiation

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 1) primary cell cultures of human cornea epithelial cells (established from cornea donors); 2) primary cell cultures of human cornea stromal keratocytes (established from cornea donors); 3) bioengineered anterior lamelar corneas consisting of corneal keratocytes immersed within fibrin-agarose biomaterials and epithelial cells on top
