TITLE
RNA expression data from primary neuroblastoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression profiles of 105 primary neuroblastomas derived from customized 4 x 44k oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent Technologies). These profiles are part of an integrative study combining genomewide epigenetic profiles with transcriptome data of the same neuroblastoma cohort. Tumors were derived from 40 low-risk, 9 intermediate-risk and 56 high-risk patients.
