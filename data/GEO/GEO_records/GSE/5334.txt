TITLE
Gene expression profiling of whole ovary in embryonic (gestional day 11, 12, 14, 16 & 18) and postnatal day 2 mice. (GUDMAP Series ID: 5)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall objective of this proposal is to map the temporal and spatial dynamics of gene expression in the fetal mouse testis at key developmental timepoints. Urogenital tract malformations are the most common birth defects in males and their incidence together with other male reproductive health concerns such as reduced fertility and testicular cancer are reportedly on the rise in the human population. To better understand the impact of genetic factors and environmental influences on testicular development, it is important to first understand normal gene expression patterns and signaling cascades within the fetal testis during development. The goal of this study is to identify cell-specific genes that can be used as biomarkers for key differentiation events. Keywords: developmental time course

DESIGN
Day to day comparison in whole ovary throughout development with triplicates at each time point.  Each sample is a pair of ovaries from a single animal and each animal is taken from a different dam (with the exception of gd11 sample numbers 18 and 19 which come from the same dam).
