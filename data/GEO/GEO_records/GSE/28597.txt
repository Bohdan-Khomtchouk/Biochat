TITLE
The Microbial Detection Array Combined with Random Phi29-Amplification used as a Diagnostic Tool for Unbiased Virus Detection in Clinical Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A common technique used for sensitive and specific diagnostic virus detection in clinical samples is PCR. However, an unbiased diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for unbiased random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, USA, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes. We propose this assay for unbiased diagnostic analysis of all viruses in clinical samples.

DESIGN
19 clinical samples were analyzed for presence of virus using the MDA microarray. One of the samples is a negative control (water). One HCV-positive serum sample is included twice (HCV+1 and HCV+2).
