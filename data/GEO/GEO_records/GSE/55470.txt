TITLE
Gene expression profiling of circulating tumor cells in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CTCs are the purpoted intermediates of metastatic dissemination and are likely to contain cellular clones responsible for disease progression representing a preferred source for identification of druggable targets. Unfortunately a molecular characterization of CTCs is seriously hampered by their low numbers even in metastatic patients and by the elevated contamination of isolated CTCs with leukocytes. With the final goal of providing a reliable assay allowing to obtain valuable information on CTC features in the clinical setting, we have developed a method based on capture with beads linked to EpCAM and to MUC1 exploiting a commercially available kit and performing an extensive gene expression profiling with the DASL platform.

DESIGN
For spike-in experiments, low pre-defined numbers of cells derived from established breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-468) were spiked into 5 mL of whole blood of healthy donor and captured using AdnaTest EMT-1/StemCell Select kit. Total RNA isolated from the captured cells together with total RNA isolated from the same in vitro cultered cells was processed in duplicate or triplicate onto Illumina Whole-Genome DASL HT platform. Finally, gene expression profiling was carried out on CTCs isolated from blood of 7 patients with advanced breast cancer. According with the characteristics of the study, data normalization was not applicable
