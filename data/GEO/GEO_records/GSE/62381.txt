TITLE
A set of differentially expressed cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) miRNAs can diagnose CNS malignancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed 80 patientsâ€™ CFS by Nanostring, and validated a microRNA profile that can differentiate between and among some classes of CNS tumors.

DESIGN
A total of 80 CSF samples were collected from the Regina Elena Institute, Rome, Italy  and from The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Sixty-six samples came from patients with benign and malignant brain lesions, while 14 from patients without brain disease.
