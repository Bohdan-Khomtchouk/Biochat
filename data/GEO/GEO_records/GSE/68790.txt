TITLE
caArray_EXP-578: Gene Expression Profiles of Pediatric B-Precursor High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (COG Study AALL0232 - Cohort 1).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment comprises 283 CEL files generated on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression microarray platform, using patient peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from the first cohort of patients accrued to Children's Oncology Group Study AALL0232. No clinical covariate data is provided at this time as the clinical study is not yet published. Researchers who would like to request outcome or other covariate data are asked to contact Dr. Cheryl Willman,   cwillman@unm.edu,  505.272.5622 (University of New Mexico) and Dr. Steven Hunger,  Stephen.Hunger@childrenscolorado.org (Children's Oncology Group and Children's Hospital Colorado) to arrange a collaboration.
