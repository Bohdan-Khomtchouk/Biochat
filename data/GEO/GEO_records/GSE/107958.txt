TITLE
RNA sequencing of a Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) mouse model containing the full human ATXN3 gene with a repeat expansion of 75-80 CAGs I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed RNA sequencing analysis of brain tissue and blood from the MJD84.2 mouse model for SCA3 (described by Cemal et al, Human molecular genetics 2002, 11:1075-1094). Mice were 17.5 months of age at sacrifice and brainstem, cerebellum, cortex and striatum were sequenced. Transgenic SCA3 mice showed most transcriptional changes in striatum and brainstem. Axon guidance, synaptic transmission, pi-3k cascade and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways are implicated to be affected based on the transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
8 wildtype vs 6 transgenic SCA3 mice. Brainstem, cerebellum, cortex and striatum at 17.5 months of age.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
