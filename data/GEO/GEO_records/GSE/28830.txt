TITLE
Differential gene expression in CD11b+ splenocytes from mice subject to social threat vs. control (II)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on splenocyte mRNA samples collected from 6 animals subject to repeated social threat and 6 animals subject to non-threatening control conditions (pooled into 3 groups of 2).  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in CD11b+ splenocytes from animals exposed to social threat vs non-threatening control conditions. Keywords: Risk prediction

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on splenocyte mRNA samples collected from 6 animals subject to repeated social threat and 6 animals subject to non-threatening control conditions (pooled into 3 groups of 2).  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in CD11b+ splenocytes from animals exposed to social threat vs non-threatening control conditions. This study provides an additional body of data from the same general protocol used in Series GSE16661, and will support more extensive analyses than the original study.
