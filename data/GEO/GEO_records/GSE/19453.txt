TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of luteinising hormone receptor deficient mice before and after testosterone treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Luteinising hormone (LH) is a key regulator of male fertility through its effects on testosterone secretion by Leydig cells.  Mice in which the LH receptor is knocked out (LuRKO) show reduced testicular size, reduced testosterone, elevated serum LH, and a spermatogenic arrest that can be rescued by administration of testosterone.  This study examines the onset of spermatogenic arrest in LuRKO males using transcriptional profiling of developing mutant and control testes.  We also examine the initial stages of testosterone rescue of the phenotype, in order to identify key upstream regulators of testosterone-dependent spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
Three experimental series were obtained: (a) a developmental time course examining LuRKO and wild-type litter-mate testes at postpartum days 3, 8, 13, 19 and 27, taking birth as day 1; (b) a “rescue” time course following the testicular response to testosterone propionate treatment (2.5mg) at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours post injection; (c) a second “rescue” time course examining the dose sensitivity of the androgen response at 24hrs post injection, using varying doses of testosterone propionate (vehicle only control, 250ng, 2.5µg, 25µg and 2.5mg).  For each experimental sample, two biological replicates were obtained.  Each individual replicate comprised pooled testis tissue from two animals.
