TITLE
Signature of mesenchymal cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analysed tes adipocytic, osteoblastic, chondrocytic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation of the stromal potential of 5 mouse mesenchymal lines derived from hematopoietic sites (bone marrow and fetal liver). The sole line, AFT024, that provide both quadripoential and capable of maintening hematopoiesis in vitro, has served as reference for genomic studies aimed at establishing the signature of the multipotential stromal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Keywords: molecular signature of MSC
