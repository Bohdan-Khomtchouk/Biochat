TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of YAP and TFCP2 down-regulated genes in liver cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify YAP and TFCP2 co-regulated genes, RNA-seq was also performed in Bel-7402 cells before and after knocking down YAP or TFCP2. From the RNA-seq data, 2165 genes were found that were possibly co-regulated by YAP and TFCP2.

DESIGN
Examination of YAP and TFCP2 down-regulated genes in Bel-7402 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL20795 HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens)
