TITLE
ChIP-chip from KG-1 cells with HIV Tat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 Tat can modulate the expression of both HIV and cellular genes. In antigen-presenting cells Tat induces the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the absence of interferons (IFNs). We investigated the genome-wide Tat association with cellular promoters in immature dendritic cells (iDC) and in monocyte derived macrophages (MDM). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Tat together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that Tat associates with the MAP2K6 and MAP2K3 promoters and mediates its increase, which also affects the induction of some ISGs.

DESIGN
comparison of KG-1 cells expressing tTA control vs Tat or mutant TatSF2G48R57A
