TITLE
Phenotypic and genomic analysis of an exceptional case of enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 2â€“5% of adult-onset coeliac disease (CD) patients develops refractory coeliac disease (RCD).  In contrast to RCD type I, RCD type II is characterised by the presence of aberrant small intestinal intraepithelial T-lymphocytes (IEL) expressing cytoplasmic CD3 but lacking surface expression of CD3, CD4 and CD8. Development of Enteropathy Associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL) is directly associated with the presence of > 20% aberrant IEL in RCD II patients and has a very poor prognosis. We report on an exceptional case of EATL presenting as leukemic ascites and on the unique opportunity to perform extensive  phenotypic and genomic analysis of this malignancy. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the ascitic EATL presentation showed CD30 expression typical for EATL and loss of the above mentioned surface markers similar to the aberrant IEL it originated from, as indicated by an identical monoclonal TCR-gamma rearrangement. In addition, expression of a substantial number of markers, including CD2, CD7, CD11a/CD18, CD52, CD103 and granzyme B was lost, which has not been reported sofar. Expression of proliferation markers Ki-67 en PCNA was clearly detected in the majority of EATL cells. Karyotype and comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analyses showed many genomic alterations, including chromosomal gains and losses up to 47Mb not previously reported for EATL. In conclusion, the current exceptional EATL presentation displays both immunophenotypic and genomic alterations not described previously and not included in the current WHO classifications of lymphoid malignancies.
