TITLE
Expression data from transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma is a nuclear receptor-type transcription factor expressed mostly in the skeletal muscle, and regulated by nutritional conditions. Previously, we established transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice), which showed lower blood glucose than the control mice. We used microarrays to investigate their glucose metabolism gene expression change.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the skeletal muscle of sex- and age-matched RXR-gamma mice and non-transgenic control mice (females at 4 months of age, five samples from each group were combined). Each of the combined samples of the two groups was hybridized to the Affymetrix MG430 microarray.
