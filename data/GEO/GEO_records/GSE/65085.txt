TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene methylation by effect of cold plasma on breast cell line MDA-MB-231.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of estrogene receptor negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, treating atmospheric cold plasma (plasma). The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k Bead chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. This profiling indicates that plasma induces epigenetic and cellular changes.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA obtained from  MDA-MB-231 where effected by cold plasma.
