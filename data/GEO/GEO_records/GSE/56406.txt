TITLE
Global gene expression analyses of paused iPSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Low Klf4 expression reproducibly gives rise to a homogeneous population of partially reprogrammed iPSCs. Upregulation of Klf4 allows these cells to resume reprogramming, indicating that they are paused iPSCs that remain on the path towards pluripotency. Paused iPSCs with different Klf4 expression levels remain at distinct intermediate stages of reprogramming.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from paused iPSCs cultured with 0, 10, 30 or 100 nM of Shield1 22 days after vector infection.
