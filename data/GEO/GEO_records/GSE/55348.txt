TITLE
Gene expression profiling of primary HER2-positive breast cancers treated with adjuvant trastuzumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to the HER2 protein, is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, reducing the risk of relapse and death in patients. Nonetheless, some patients relapse after treatment, underscoring the need to identify patients for whom chemotherapy + trastuzumab is adequate versus patients requiring additional drugs. To search for genes predictive of relapse in HER2-positive breast carcinoma patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab, we conducted gene expression profiling analysis in 53 cases treated in the clinic with doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) and trastuzumab.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 53 patients with primary HER2-positive (HER2+) tumors. The series consists in 23 relapsed and 30 non-relapsed cases with similar clinical-pathological characteristics (size, pathological lymph node involvement and estrogen receptor positivity) (3-year median follow up).
