TITLE
Interconnections between RNA-processing pathways revealed by a sequencing-based genetic screen for pre-mRNA splicing mutants in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Splicing profiling of deletion strains compared to wild-type control

DESIGN
Splicing sensitive S. pombe microarrays (Agilent-027365) were used to compare the splicing profile of various deletion strains relative to wild-type.
