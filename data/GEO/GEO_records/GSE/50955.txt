ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection of human fibroblasts with either human cytomegalovirus strain AD169 or a recombinant virus deleted for HCMV US17 Illumina HT-12 beadarrays were used to quantitate levels of host transcripts at either 12 or 96 hpi.

DESIGN
Cells were infected in biological triplicates at both 12 and 96 hours post infetion
