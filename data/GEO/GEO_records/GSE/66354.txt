TITLE
Investigation of the mechansim underlying the inflammatory phenotype in Group A ependymoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory response has been identified as a molecular signature of high-risk Group A ependymoma (EPN). To better understand the biology of this phenotype and aid therapeutic development, transcriptomic data from Group A and B EPN patient tumor samples, and additional malignant and normal brain data, were analyzed to identify the mechanism underlying EPN group A inflammation. Gene expression profiles of Group A and B EPN were contrasted to identify inflammatory transcriptional profiles (GSEA analysis). Candidate inflammatory mechanism genes were examined across a broader cohort of pediatric and adult brain tumor types and normal brain.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from surgical tumor and normal brain samples (n=149) using Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips (Platform GPL570).
