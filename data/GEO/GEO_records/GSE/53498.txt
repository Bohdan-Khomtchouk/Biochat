TITLE
Human PGC commitment shares key gene dynamics to mouse, but owns a unique PRDM14 expression pattern

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The  molecular mechanisms of human primordial germ cell (PGC) specification are poorly understood due to the inaccessibility of cell materials and the lack of an alternative in vitro model that enables tracking of the earliest stages of germ cell development. Here, we introduce a defined and efficient differentiation system for the induction of pre-migratory PGC-like cells from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By step-wise differentiation, we generated an OCT4+/ T+/BLIMP1+ cell population that transitioned into STELLA expressing PGC-like cells that exhibited a similar key gene expression as mouse PGCs as well as global epigenetic reprogramming. Even though, these PGC-like cells expressed PRDM14 at very low levels, they underwent activation of pluripotency/PGC genes, suppression of neural induction and suppression of de novo DNA methylation, events that are regulated by Prdm14 during mouse PGC specification. This study demonstrates that human PGC commitment shares many key features with mouse PGC specification, but harbors unique and so far unknown mechanisms that, point to a novel human transcriptional regulation.
