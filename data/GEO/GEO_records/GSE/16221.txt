TITLE
UTX Chromatin Immunoprecipitation on human HG18 Nimblegen 2 array promoter set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UTX binding sites were located genome wide in primary human fibroblasts (foot and lung) Tiled promoters with a probe per 100bp of refseq known genes 3kb upstream and 700 bp downstream of transcriptional start

DESIGN
8 samples (2 cell types (foot and lung primary human fibroblasts) x 2 set promoter arrays x 2 channels (channel 1 = ChIP = Cy5, channel 2 = input (10% of total genomic DNA hybed) = Cy3)

PLATFORM
GPL6325 NimbleGen Homo sapiens HG18 promoter 1 of 2
