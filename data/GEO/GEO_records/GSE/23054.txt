TITLE
Dual-species microarray for assessing gene expression in stromal microenvironment, cancer cells and their interactions (v1 array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Design a human-mouse dual-species microarray to provide a technology for investigation of cancer-stromal interaction in xenograft model.

DESIGN
Reference RNA from human and mouse were labeled using Cy5, while the mixture of human and mouse RNA were labeled using Cy3. Samples were hybridized on customized-commercial array with Agilent probes and user-designed species-specific probes (Human-mouse dual-species array HomoMusArray v1).

PLATFORM
GPL10714 [Agilent-021439] University of Chicago-Dual Species (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus) 87K array
