TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of WT and XBP1 Mutant Larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
the purpose of the study is to compare the gene expression profile of WT vs. XBP1 Mutant Drosophila Larvae Methods: RNA sequencing was performed from 2nd instar Larvae of WT and XBP1 Mutant flies Results: Across the 4 samples, there was an average of 51 million mapped reads per sample with an average unique mapping rate of 83%.  Using an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, 154 genes were calculated to be differentially expressed. Conclusions: XBP1 affects gene expression profiling in drosophila larvae

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling during normal development of the fly

PLATFORM
