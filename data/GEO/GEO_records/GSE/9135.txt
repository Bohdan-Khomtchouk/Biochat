Microarray-Bioinformatics analysis of altered genomic expression profiles in the human fetal and infant myocardium

SUMMARY
Develop of the heart during perinatal period must involve the differentially expression of a myriad of genes. We can think about the developmental events of heart formation in the context of genetic networks. However the knowledge of the genetic basis in governing and regulating of this development is still partial and scattered; an overall elucidation of the differential expressed genes blueprint before and after birth has never been proposed. The global recognition of difference in molecular level between the fetus and infants is necessary for it can provide not only further revealing the mechanism of heart development, but also set up a better molecular foundation of myocardial protection in fetal cardiac surgery for pediatric cardiac surgeons. In this study we outline a genetic blueprint for the development between fetal and postnatal heart using DNA microarray, and we also validate the microarray result by RT-PCR. Comparing with the microarray results from fetal and natal heart, The differentially expression gene was analyzed by gene ontology (GO), Entra Gene and can be partitioned to 15 categories. The meanings of some categories had been discussed. The differentially genes include the groups for metabolism, hyperplasia, development, extracellular matrix components, transcription regulation, signal transduction et al relative. It is remarkable that we also found some differentially expression genes never reported before, that will provide some clue for future heart development research.
