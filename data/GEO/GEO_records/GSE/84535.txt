TITLE
Next-generation sequencing and quantitative analysis of wild type and p110gamma -/- tumors and tumor-associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify quantitative gene expression differences between whole tumor and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) derived from Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors grown in wild type and PI3Kinase-gamma-null mice. Methods: mRNA profiles of whole tumor or tumor-associated macrophages (CD11b+Gr1- cells) from wild type (WT) or PI3Kinase-gamma-knockout (p110g-/-) mice were generated by single deep read sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were aligned to mouse transcriptome using the bowtie2 aligner. Gene-level summaries were normalized and analyzed for differential expression using DESeq.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of whole tumor and tumor-associated macrophages from WT and p110g-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing in triplicate using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
