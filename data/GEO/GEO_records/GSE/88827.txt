TITLE
Establishment and characterization of a new murine cell line of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sarcomatoid HCC is a rare and highly malignant type of HCC. A mouse cell line, Ymac-1 was established as a cell model of sarcomatoid HCC. The finding of this study could be useful for developing biomarkers and therapeutic modalities for sarcomatoid HCC. We used microarrays to delineate the mechnism of action of sarcomatoid HCC in normal mice liver, Gnmt-/- mice liver tumor, and Ymac-1 cell.

DESIGN
Tissue and Cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Phalanx Microarray. Differentially expression genes between  normal mice liver, Gnmt-/- mice liver tumor, and Ymac-1 cells were identified for functional study.
