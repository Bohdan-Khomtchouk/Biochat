TITLE
Expression of gallstone disease-associated genes in non-diseased and diseased gallbladder and liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Following a large-scale genome-wide association study of gallstone disease, we performed RNA sequencing from tissues of four human gallbladders (3 healthy controls and 1 case with chronic gallstones) and one liver sample from the gallstone case. We aimed to determine the expression patterns of gallstone disease-associated genes in gallbladder and liver, two organs of interest in disease etiology.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of four female human gallbladders (3 healthy controls and 1 case with chronic gallstones) and one liver sample from the gallstone case.
