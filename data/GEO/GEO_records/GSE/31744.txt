TITLE
Comparison of Flk-1+/PDGFRa+(Flk-1PRa+(DP)) population from Etv2Het vs Etv2KO ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Screening for genes regulated by Etv2 within Flk-1+/PDGFRa+ ES derived mesoderm.Microarray analysis performed to screen for the candidate genes regulated by Etv2.  TT2 ES cells differentiated on OP9 feeder cells were sorted using Flk-1 and PDGFRa antibodies.Gene expressions from these two populations were compared.

DESIGN
Extract RNA from sorted  Flk-1+/PDGFRa+ populations from Etv2Het vs KO cells. To obtain primitive mesoderm cells TT2 ES cells of corresponding genotypes were differentiated on OP9 cells for 4 days.  Flk-1+/PDGFRa+ populations were sorted from Etv2 Het vs. KO cells for RNA extraction.
