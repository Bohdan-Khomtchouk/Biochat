TITLE
Expression data from 18h-fasted WT versus KLF15-null mice: liver and quadriceps skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to identify differences in gene expression levels, in liver and in quadriceps skeletal muscle, between 18h (overnight) fasted WT control and Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15)-null mice. Keywords: comparative expression analysis, fasted state
