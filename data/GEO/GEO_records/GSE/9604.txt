TITLE
Mouse Fkbp8 activity is required to inhibit cell death and establish DV patterning in the posterior neural tube

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Fkbp8 mutants specifically present with spinal cord abnormalities and spina bifida. The aim is to identify gene expression changes in the posterior embryonic tissue lacking the Fkbp8 gene, so as to understand genes or gene pathways important for normal spinal cord development. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Heterozygous Fkbp8 mutant mice were intercrossed to obtain embryos of all three genotypes. Posterior tissue (immediately after forelimb bud) was dissected from E9.5 embryos and RNA extracted. Three wildtype tissues and three mutant tissues were used for hybridization on commercially available CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome array.

PLATFORM
GPL5025 Codelink Mouse Whole genome array platform for TAMU CERH genomics core
