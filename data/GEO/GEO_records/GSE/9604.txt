TITLE
Mouse Fkbp8 activity is required to inhibit cell death and establish DV patterning in the posterior neural tube

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Fkbp8 mutants specifically present with spinal cord abnormalities and spina bifida. The aim is to identify gene expression changes in the posterior embryonic tissue lacking the Fkbp8 gene, so as to understand genes or gene pathways important for normal spinal cord development. Keywords: Genetic modification
