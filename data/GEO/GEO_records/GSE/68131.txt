TITLE
Methylation Profile of postmature-green-stage seed and dry seed from Arabidopsis ddcc mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The role of non-CG methylation in seed development and dormancy remains unknown. There are four genes in charge of non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis: drm1, drm2, cmt2 and cmt3. The majority of non-CG methylation in vegetative tissues, leaf, is gone in homozygous ddcc mutant line (Hume et al., 2014). To uncover the possible role of non-CG DNA methylation in seed development and dormancy, we characterized the methylome of ddcc mutant in Arabidopsis postmature-green-stage seed and dry seed using Illumina sequencing. Meanwhile, vegetative tissue, leaves from 3 week plant with ddcc mutant and from wild-type, and postmature-green-stage seed and dry seed from wild-type plant were used as control.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA from postmature-green-stage seed, dry seed, and 3-week-plant leaves of ddcc mutant and wild-type.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
