TITLE
A novel lncRNA GAS1 promotes gastric carcinogenesis and acts as a modular scaffold of WDR5 and KAT2A complexes to specify the histone modification pattern [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate whether GAS1 plays a role in gastric cancer tumorigenesis, a RNA-seq analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of GAS1 shRNA and control shRNA transfectants.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed in BGC 823 gastric cancer cells after GAS1 shRNA and control shRNA virus infection
