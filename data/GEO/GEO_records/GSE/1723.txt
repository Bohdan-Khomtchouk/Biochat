TITLE
Two-dimensional transcriptome analysis in chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to study this interaction by analyzing genome-wide transcriptional responses to four different nutrient-limitation regimes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae. This ‘two-dimensional’ approach resulted in a new, robust set of ‘anaerobic’ and ‘aerobic’ signature transcripts for S. cerevisiae, as well as to a refinement of previous reports on nutrient-responsive genes. Moreover, the identification of genes regulated both by nutrient and oxygen availability provided new insight in cross-regulated network and hierarchy in the control of gene expression.
