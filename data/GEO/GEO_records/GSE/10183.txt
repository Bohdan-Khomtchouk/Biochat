TITLE
Primary prostate cancer cell specific expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer cells were MACS sorted from tumor tissue specimem 05-179. Self replicates of CD26+ cancer cells were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. These data represent cancer cell type specific transcriptome. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Self replicates of the sorted were done.

PLATFORM
