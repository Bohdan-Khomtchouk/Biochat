TITLE
Role of de novo DNA methyltransferases in hematopoietic stem cells (WGBS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the global DNA methylation changes in Dnmt3a-KO and Dnmt3ab-dKO HSCs compared to control HSCs, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing

DESIGN
Mouse hematopoietic stem cell DNA methylation profiles of control, Dnmt3a-KO and Dnmt3ab-dKO HSCs  were generated generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
