TITLE
Transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana ceh1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we present the transcriptomic profile of mutant plants designated as ceh1 (constitutively expressing HPL).   CEH1 encodes 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS), the enzyme controlling the bottleneck step of the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastids. Mutation of this enzyme in ceh1 mutant led to accumulation of high levels of the stress specific signaling metabolite 2c-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cylclodiphosphate (MEcPP), and consequently constitutive activation of a selected otherwise stress responsive genes.   This data identifies the ensemble of stress responsive genes whose expression is regulated by the MEcPP signaling cascade.

DESIGN
About 20 two-week-old plants grown on 1/2 MS medium were collected to extract total RNA. Transcriptome of parent line and ceh1 mutant were compared.
