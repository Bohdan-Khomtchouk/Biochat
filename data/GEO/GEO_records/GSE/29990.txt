TITLE
Exon array analysis in the mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells treated with control-, Cugbp1- or Mbnl1-siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CUGBP1 and MBNL1 are developmentally regulated RNA-binding proteins that are causally associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1. Using HITS-CLIP anlysis, we found CUGBP1 and MBNL1 preferentially bind to alternatively spliced introns and exons, as well as to the 3' UTRs.  To analyze more directly the role of CUGBP1/MBNL1 binding in alternative splicing, we performed exon array analysis in C2C12 cells using expression arrays.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of C2C12 cells treated with control-, Cugbp1- or Mbnl1-siRNA. RNA was harvested 48 hrs after transfection.
