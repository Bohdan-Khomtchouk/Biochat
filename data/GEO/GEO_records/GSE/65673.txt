TITLE
Fucose-mediated transcriptional activation of the fcs operon by FcsR in Streptococcus pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
In this study, we explore the impact of fucose on the transcriptome of S. pneumoniae D39. The expression of various genes and operons, including the fucose uptake PTS and utilization operon (fcs operon), was altered in the presence of fucose. By means of quantitative RT-PCR and β-galactosidase analysis, we demonstrate the role of the transcriptional regulator FcsR, present upstream of the fcs operon, as a transcriptional activator of the fcs operon. We also predict a 19-bp putative FcsR regulatory site (5’-ATTTGAACATTATTCAAGT-3’) in the promoter region of the fcs operon. The functionality of this predicted FcsR regulatory site was further confirmed by promoter-truncation experiments, where deletion of half of the FscR regulatory site or full deletion led to the abolition of expression of the fcs operon.

DESIGN
Transcriptome comparison of the Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 wild-type grown in M17 plus 0.5% glucose (GM17) to grown in M17 plus 0.5% fucose (FM17). Two conditions design comparison of one strain including a dye swap.
