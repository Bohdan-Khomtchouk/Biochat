TITLE
Deletion of the celA gene in Aspergillus nidulans triggers overexpression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
The cell wall is a structure involved in important stages of fungal growth and morphogenesis. Several studies in the literature have shown how perturbations at the cell wall-level trigger dramatic effects on growth (e.g. Horiuchi, 2009). Despite the importance of fungal cell walls and despite the great advances made in the field, there are still missing pieces in our understanding of cell wall dynamics in filamentous fungi. Some cell wall biosynthetic genes, for example, are still uncharacterized (for a detailed inventory of Aspergillus nidulans cell wall-related genes, see de Groot et al., 2009). The chief polysaccharides in the cell wall of the model organism A. nidulans are β-glucans (β-1,3-, β-(1,3;1,4)- and β-1,6-glucans), chitin and α-1,3-glucans. While much is known about the chitin and α-1,3-glucan biosynthetic genes in A. nidulans (Horiuchi et al., 1999; Fujiwara et al., 2000; Ichinomiya et al., 2002 and 2005; Takeshita et al., 2006; Yoshimi et al., 2013), no characterization is yet available for the celA gene (ANIA_08444) encoding a putative mixed-linkage glucan synthase (de Groot et al., 2009). Recently, a study on A. fumigatus has characterized Tft1, an enzyme shown to be responsible for the production of β-(1,3;1,4)-glucans in this organism (Samar et al., 2015). Deletion of Tft1 causes no obvious phenotype in A. fumigatus and a modest increase in virulence. To characterize the role of β-(1,3;1,4)-glucans in the growth and development of filamentous fungi, we here sought to provide transcriptomics data of an A. nidulans strain showing reduced expression of the gene encoding the putative mixed linkage glucan synthase celA.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of the control (SAA.111) and downregulated celA- strains of Aspergillus nidulans. Each condition consists of 3 biological replicates.
