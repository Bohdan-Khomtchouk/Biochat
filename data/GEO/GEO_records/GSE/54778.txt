TITLE
Glucocorticoid induced gene-regulation in murine bone marrow derived monocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids (GC) are used as first line therapies for generalized suppression of inflammation (e.g. allergies or autoimmune diseases), but their long-term use is limited by severe side effects. Our previous work has revealed that GC induced a stable anti-inflammatory phenotype in monocytes, the glucocorticoid-stimulated monocytes (GCsM) that we now exploited for targeted GC-mediated therapeutic effects. We demonstrate that GCsM interact with T-cells in suppressing proliferation as well as cytokine release of CD8+ and especially CD4+ T-cells in vitro, and that they support generation of Foxp3+ cells.  We therefore tested their immunosuppressive potential in CD4+ T-cell-induced colitis in vivo. We found that injection of GCsM into mice with already established severe colitis abolishes the inflammation and results in significant clinical improvement within a few days. T-cells recovered from GCsM-treated mice reveal reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-ÔÅß or IL-17. Furthermore, accumulation of clusters of Foxp3+ CD4+ T-cells were detectable at local sites of inflammation in their colon.   Thus, GCsM are able to modify T-cell responses in vitro and in vivo and are able to down-regulate and clinically cure an established severe T-cell mediated colitis.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived monocytes where cultured 16 h with media containing M-CSF (control monocytes) or media containing M-CSF and dexamethasone (GCsM). In three independent experiments, total RNA from GCsM and control monocytes was isolated and processed for microarray hybridization.
