TITLE
Acute effects of particulate matter (EHC-93) inhalation in mice with chronic lung inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the impact of chronic lung inflammation on the pulmonary transcriptional response to inhaled urban particles.  Transcript levels were measured using high density microarrays in total RNA isolated from whole lungs of wildtype and TNF-α overexpressing mice exposed by inhalation to particulate matter and euthanized immediately or 24 h post-exposure. Keywords: Toxicology, disease state analysis, stress response

DESIGN
Transgenic SP-C/TNF-α mice and their wildtype littermates were exposed by inhalation to particulate matter (0, 42 mg/m3 EHC-93) for 4 h and euthanized immediately or 24 h post-exposure (n=5 per treatment per time point, 40 animals total).  Agilent 22K oligonucleotide microarrays were used to examine transcript levels in whole lung RNA.  Stratagene Universal Mouse RNA was used as a reference.
