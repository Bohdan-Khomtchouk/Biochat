TITLE
Acute effects of particulate matter (EHC-93) inhalation in mice with chronic lung inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the impact of chronic lung inflammation on the pulmonary transcriptional response to inhaled urban particles.  Transcript levels were measured using high density microarrays in total RNA isolated from whole lungs of wildtype and TNF-Î± overexpressing mice exposed by inhalation to particulate matter and euthanized immediately or 24 h post-exposure. Keywords: Toxicology, disease state analysis, stress response
