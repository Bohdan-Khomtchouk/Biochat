TITLE
Gene Expression Profile Changes due to Bleomycin-Induced DNA Damage in Human Fibroblasts in Space

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand gene expression responses in confluent human fibroblast in microgravity conditions to bleomycin treatment.

DESIGN
Confluent human fibroblasts AG01522 were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). After three day on ISS, the cells were treated with bleomycin at 1.0 microg/ml for 3 hours. The cells were washed and fixed with RNALater. Total RNA were isolated after the samples were returned to earth and subject to microarray analysis.
