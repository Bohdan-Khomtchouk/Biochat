TITLE
Genome-wide map of PCL2 (Polycomb-like 2) enrichment in undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In total 8,736,191 reads from IP fraction and 9,958,984 reads from Wash fraction uniquely mapped to the mouse genome (mm9). Settings for enrichment analysis: maxSpacing=500; minHits=20; minPeakHits=6; minRatio=3. 4,701 regions have been identified as enriched in the IP fraction. In order to get a rough idea of false discovery rate (FDR), enrichment analysis using Wash fraction as test and IP fraction as control was performed, 15 regions was found. This suggests that the FDR likely is around 0.3%. Keywords: Epigenetics

DESIGN
Examination of PCL2 enrichment in mouse ESCs.
