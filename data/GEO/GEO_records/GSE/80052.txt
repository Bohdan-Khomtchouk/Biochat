TITLE
Transcriptome-wide RNA 5-methylcytosine methylation in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we use bisulfite conversion of rRNA depleted RNA combined with high-throughput Illumina sequencing (RBS-seq) to identify single-nucleotide resolution of m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. m5C sites were analyzed in wild type (WT) and an Arabidopsis T-DNA KO mutant for the RNA methyltransferase TRM4B.

DESIGN
RNA bisulfite sequencing was used to identify candidate m5C sites transcriptome-wide in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, using rRNA depleted RNA. Illumina sequencing was performed on a HiSeq platform. The two genotypes used are wild type and trm4b-1. All genotypes have three biological replicates with one technical replicate for each biological replicate.
