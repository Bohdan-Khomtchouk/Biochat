TITLE
Calcineurin/Nfatc1 signaling links skin stem cell quiescence to hormonal signaling during pregnancy and lactation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclosporine A (CSA) leads to the precocious onset of hair follicle growth, which is driven by premature activation and proliferation of hair follicle stem cells.  Here, we identify gene expression changes associated with CSA treatment in hair follicle stem cells prior to the onset of proliferation as a readout for the early events in stem cell actvation.

DESIGN
Hair follicle bulge stem cells were FACS-isolated from mouse skin during the 2nd telogen.  Two biological replicated were performed.
