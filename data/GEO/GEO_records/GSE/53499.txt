TITLE
LED, a long non-coding RNA activator of enhancer RNAs, is hypermethylated in human cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LED, a long non-coding RNA induced by Nutlin-3a, was found to activate enhancer RNAs, one of which was found in an intron of CDKN1A (p21).

DESIGN
Impact of expression of LED was assessed in MCF7 cells using RNAseq and GROseq. Chromatin binding of LED was assessed using ChIRPseq.
