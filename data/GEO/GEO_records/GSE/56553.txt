TITLE
Short-term exposure to diesel exhaust is associated with dynamic changes in DNA methylation of circulating mononuclear cells in asthmatics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation in asthmatics after short-term exposure to diesel exhaust

DESIGN
This cohort consist of genomic DNA extracted from 16 individuals under 6 distinct conditions, bisulphite converted and hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip for genome wide DNA methylation profiling.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
