TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Triticea seed and vegetative tissues

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Despite their importance, there remains to be few large scale expression-based studies of tissue-specific expression information in the species belonging to the Triticeae. We used the 55K Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Wheat Genome Array to generate a gene expression atlas of triticale tissues.  The global transcriptional profiles of seed tissues (embryo, endosperm, crease, pericarp and epiderm) and vegetative tissues (root, coleoptile, stem and leaf) were analyzed and co-regulated as well as preferentially expressed genes were identified. Data analysis revealed both novel and conserved regulatory factors underlying Triticeae tissue development and function.
