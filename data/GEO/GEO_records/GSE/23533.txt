TITLE
Effect of light on gene expression in Schizophyllum commune

ORGANISM
Schizophyllum commune

SUMMARY
In order to study the effect of light on gene expression in Schizophyllum commune, genome wide gene expression was analysed in 4-day-old monokaryotic and dikaryotic wild type colonies, grown either in light or in darkness.

DESIGN
4 samples: - monokaryon, grown for 4 days in the light - monokaryon, grown for 4 days in the dark - dikaryon, grown for 4 days in the light - dikaryon, grown for 4 days in the dark RNA was obtained from 3 biological replicates and pooled
