TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles across the normal human body

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human tissue samples from ten post-mortem donors were processed to generate total RNA, which was subsequently analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays.  Donor information: Donor 1 - 25 year old male; donor 2 - 38 year old male; donor 3 - 39 year old female; donor 4 - 30 year old male; donor 5 - 35 year old male; donor 6 - 52 year old male; donor 7 - 50 year old female; donor 8 - 48 year old female; donor 9 - 53 year old female; donor 10 - 23 year old female Keywords: normal human tissue comparison

DESIGN
Comparison of normal human tissues; 65 tissues represented, including 20 distinct regions of the CNS
