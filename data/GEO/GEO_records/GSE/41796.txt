TITLE
Influence of ATL-type Helios overexpression or WT-Helios/Ikaros knockdown on gene expression profile in Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been known that aberrant isoforms of Ikaros family ptoteins are expressed in malignant cells. We identified that PBMC of ATL (acute T-cell leukemia) patients expresses different patterns of Helios isoforms compared with normal PBMC. In order to investigate the biological impact of ATL-type Helios isoform, we conducted complehensive gene expression analyses in Jurkat cells overexpressing ATL-type Helios. Also, we investigated the influence of WT-Helios or WT-Ikaros knockdown on the gene expression profile and compared with that of the cells with ATL-type Helios overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from Jurkat cells were subjected to Cy-3 labeling followed by human whole genome gene expression microarray analyses.
