TITLE
Differentially expressed gene profiles according to physical status of human papillomavirus integration in cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA into the host genome is a critical aetiological event in the progression from normal cervix to intraepithelial neoplasm, and finally to invasive cervical cancer. In this study, we want to know how HPV DNA physical status relates to treatment outcome for cervical carcinomas.

DESIGN
Cervical cancer samples were compared with normal sample. And also, we divided 39 cervical cancer patients into four groups according to HPV DNA physical status and investigated differentially expressed gene profiles in these groups using Agilent two-color experiment.
