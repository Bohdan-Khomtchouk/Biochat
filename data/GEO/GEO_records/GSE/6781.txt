TITLE
The NsrR regulon of Escherichia coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was carried out to reveal the regulon of NsrR. Keywords: Response to repressor titration and different growth conditions
