TITLE
Critical roles of Rictor/Sin1complexes in IFN-dependent Stat activation and generation of antiproliferative responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide evidence that IFN-induced Stat-activation is defective in cells with targeted disruption of the Rictor gene, whose protein product is a key element of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).   Our studies show that transient or stable knockdown of Rictor leads to decreased expression of several IFN-inducible genes that mediate important biological functions, including antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic responses.

DESIGN
Rictor+/+ and Rictor-/- MEFs were treated with 2500 U/ml of mouse IFNÎ± for 24 hours
