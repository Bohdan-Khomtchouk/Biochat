TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human iPSC derived podocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of human iPSC derived podocytes were analyzed by utilizing NEPHS1-GFP knock-in human iPS cell line. The induced podocytes shows characteristic gene expression pattern that overlap with those of mouse and human podocytes in vivo.

DESIGN
Kidney tissue was induced from human iPSC by our originally established protocol. NEPHS1-GPF knock-in human iPSC was used to isolate podocytes from induced kidney tissues. To identify the molecules which are specifically expressed in induced podocytes, NEPHS1-GFP positive and negative fractions were sorted by FACS and compared. RNA was isolated from cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
