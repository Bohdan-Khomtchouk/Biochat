TITLE
Cdc14 as transcription regulator of RNA pol-II

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In yeast, the phosphatase Cdc14 is required for mitotic exit and for segregation of repetitive regions. Cdc14 is also a subunit of the silencing complex RENT, but no roles in transcription repression have been described. Here we report that Cdc14 promotes silencing at the integenic spacer sequences (IGS) of ribosomal genes during interphase and at Y' repeats in sub-telomeric regions during mitosis, through its ability to dephosphotylate the CDT domain of the RNA polymerase II.

DESIGN
CDC14 and CDC15 strains were grown at 25°C and 37°C. Comparisons were made between each strain at different temperatures, and between strains at the same temperature.
