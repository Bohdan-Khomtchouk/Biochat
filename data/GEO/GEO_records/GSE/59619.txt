TITLE
The transcriptomes for primary panicle in four near-isogenic lines combined of different allele of two major grain length loci GS3 and qGL3 in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To investigate the genetic relationship between two major grain length loci GS3 and qGL3, we developed the near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-GS3 (GS3/qGL3), NIL-qgl3 (gs3/qgl3), NIL-GS3/qgl3 (GS3/qgl3) in the background of 93-11 (gs3/qGL3) by crossing  and MAS approach.

DESIGN
Four samples was analyzed: three near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-GS3 (GS3/qGL3), NIL-qgl3 (gs3/qgl3), NIL-GS3/qgl3 (GS3/qgl3) and their background of 93-11. Every sample had three independed duplications. And the primary panicle with 3-6 cm length from the three NILs and 93-11 were used for RNA preparation and hybrid with Rice Genome OneArray Microarray (Phalanx Biotech Group).
