TITLE
CGH analysis of AG-haESCs (androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The genomic DNA sample of AG-haESCs were compared to the C57BL/6J male mouse kidney by comparative genomic hybridization. The data confirmed that the haploid cells sustained genome integrity.

DESIGN
The analysis was performed on a NimbleGen Mouse CGH 3x720K Whole-Genome Tiling Array to analyse the copy number variations in AG-haESCs, and the genomic DNA of C57BL/6J  male  mouse kidney was used as control, which had the same background with haploid ESCs.
