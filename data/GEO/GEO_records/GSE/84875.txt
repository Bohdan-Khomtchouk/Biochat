TITLE
Gene expression analysis of parental cell lines and cell lines with acquired resistance to compound 3 (C03) and compound 7 (C07).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells were cultured for a period of six months in slowly escalating concentrations of two small molecules (Compound 3 and Compund 7) whose protein target was unknown. Over this six month period, the cells cultured in C03 and C07 became resistant to the differentiation and growth inhibitory effects of the the compounds. Total RNA was harvested for RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed in singlicate by RNA-sequencing.
