TITLE
Gene-expression profile of the response to E. coli (k2bh2) infection in the bovine udder

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Mastitis in dairy cows is one of the most costly and prevalent diseases affecting dairy cows world wide. Insight in the molecular regulation of the host immune response to an E. coli infection, could help to develop new strategies to prevent cattle from E. coli infection. Here we performed a gene-expression analysis from udder tissue exposed to a controlled E. coli infection at T=24h post infection (p.i.) representing the acute phase response and at T=192h p.i. representing a chronic stage.
