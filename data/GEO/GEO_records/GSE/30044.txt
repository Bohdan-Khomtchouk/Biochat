TITLE
Molecular mechanism of DNA minor groove binding ligand as a radiation modulator

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radiation-induced DNA damage initiates a complex series of overlapping responses responsible for the maintenance of genome integrity. This study reports the expression analysis in response to DNA minor groove binding ligand (DMA-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-[2’-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5`-benzimidazolyl] benzimidazole, an analogue of Hoechst 33342), with an emphasis on its ability to afford better protection in cells exposed to ionizing radiation.

DESIGN
Four different types of samples were employed in the analysis: Control (untreated) cells, 50µM ligand-treated cells, 2Gy radiation-treated cells, and cells treated with 50µM ligand one hour prior to 2Gy irradiation.
