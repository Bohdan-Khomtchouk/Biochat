TITLE
Gene expression profile in spleens of congenic mice 24 hours after total body irradiation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Gvh1 gene loci was identified by linkage analysis in a segregating mouse backcross.  Congenic mapping has refined the linked loci to a 1.3 Mb interval on mouse Chr16 (39.41 - 40.71Mb) that constitutes the congenic interval in the B10.BALB-16.C2A mouse line.  Gene expression microarray was performed to characterize downstream transcripitional regulation by risk variants in the congenic interval;.

DESIGN
Each individual sample was pooled from 3 mice and performed in triplicate for each experimental group (TBI 900 cGy versus 0 cGy) for statistical analysis.

PLATFORM
