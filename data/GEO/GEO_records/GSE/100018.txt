TITLE
CLIP-seq analysis of NC-RNA interactions in wild-type and eccentric particles

ORGANISM
Human immunodeficiency virus 1

SUMMARY
Nucleocapsid (NC) CLIP-seq experiments were conducted on wild-type and eccentric HIV-1 virions generated in the presence of allosteric integrase inhibitor, BI-B2.

DESIGN
NC CLIP-seq experiments were conducted by immunoprecipitation of NC-RNA complexes from fully formed mature and eccentric virus particles. Libraries of RNA molecules bound by NC were generated and sequenced by Illumina Hi-Seq2500 platform.
