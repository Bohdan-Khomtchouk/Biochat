TITLE
Expression data from mouse gastric tumor models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic mice with prostaglandin E2 pathway in stomach develops gastric tumors. Simultaneous activation of both Wnt pathway and prostaglandin E2 pathway causes gastric adenocarcinoma. Combination of prostaglandin E2 pathway activation and suppression of BMP pathway leads to the development of gastric hamartomas. We used microarrays to find the mechanism of these tumor development and to evaluate whether these mouse models recapitulate human gastric tumors.

DESIGN
Glandular stomach from three C57BL/6 wild-type, five K19-Wnt1 transgenic, three K19-C2mE, five K19-Wnt1/C2mE, two K19-Nog, and three K19-Nog/C2mE transgenic mice were used. All mice were female at 18-65 weeks of age.
