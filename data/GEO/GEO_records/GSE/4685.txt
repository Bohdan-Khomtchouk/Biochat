TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in rice mature leaf and cultured cell suspension using Rice SuperSAGE Array1

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We developed a novel platform for genome-wide gene expression analysis in any eukaryotic organism, that we coin SuperSAGE Array. The SuperSAGE Array is a microarray onto which oligonucleotides of 26 nucleotides corresponding to SuperSAGE tag sequences are directly synthesized.  A SuperSAGE Array combines the advantages of the highly quantitative SuperSAGE expression analysis with the high-throughput microarray technology.  Highly reproducible gene expression profiling by the SuperSAGE Array was demonstrated for a thousand of genes (tags) in rice. Keywords: Tissues, SuperSAGE, 26base oligonucleotide

DESIGN
SuperSAGE Array was produced by on-chip synthesis of 26-base long oligonucleotides exactly corresponding to the tag sequences.
