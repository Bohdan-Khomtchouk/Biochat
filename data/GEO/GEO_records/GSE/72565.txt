TITLE
Binding of STAT5 upon IL-2 treatment to genomic sites in mouse CD8 T cells costimulated in vivo through CD134 plus CD137

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OT-I CD8 T cells primed with cognate SIINFEKL peptide and agonists to the costimulatory receptors CD134 and CD137 were stimulated with and without IL-2, and then STAT5 ChIP-seq was performed.

DESIGN
Examination of IL-2-induced STAT5 binding to genomic sites in effector CD8 T cells

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
