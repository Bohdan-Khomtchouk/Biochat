TITLE
Microbial diversity of an uncontaminated and a 2,4,6-TNT contaminated soil sample with CodeLink microarrays

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida ; unidentified

SUMMARY
Comparison of probe-target dissociations of probe Eub338 and Gam42a with native RNA of P. putida, in vitro transcribed 16s rRNA of P. putida, in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA of a 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene contaminated soil and an uncontaminated soil sample. Functional ANOVA revealed no significant differences in the dissociation curves of probe Eub338 when hybridised to the different samples. On the opposite, the dissociation curve of probe Gam42a with native RNA of P. putida was significantly different than the dissociation curves obtained with in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA samples. Keywords: Microbial diversity, thermal dissociation analysis, CodeLink microarray

DESIGN
Four samples: 1) native RNA of P. putida, 2) in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA of P. putida, 3) in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA of an unconontaminated soil sample, 4) in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA of a 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene contaminated soil sample. Each hybridisation experiment was done in triplicate.

PLATFORM
