TITLE
Leishmania major promastigote ChIP-chip: TBP, SNAP50, acetylH3

ORGANISM
Leishmania major

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify likely sites of polycistronic transcription initiation in a kinetoplastid parasite.  Peaks in histone H3 acetylations were found to mark these likely sites, with TBP and SNAP50 enriched upstream of these acetylation peaks.  Acetylation peaks are greater in rapidly dividing cells than in stationary cells.

DESIGN
Each ChIP sample was compared to an input chromatin sample that underwent a mock immunoprecipitation (without antiserum), or in the case of acetylH3 ChIPs, used an antiserum that recognized total H3 histones.  Log ratios and raw scores for each probe are provided.
