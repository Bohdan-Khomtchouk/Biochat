TITLE
To compare the levels of expression of the different glycosyltransferases in order to explain the exclusive detection of LeX in the neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human NT2- cells differentiate in vitro into NT2N neurons in the presence of retinoic acid, and culture in the presence of mitosis inhibitors. We have previously observed the presence of the Lewisx determinant exclusively in NT2N neurons but not in NT2- cells. We also obtained evidence that Lex is synthesized in these cells by FUT9 (Brito,...,Costa (2007) J. Neurosci. Res. 85, 1260).

DESIGN
We would like to compare the levels of expression of the different glycosyltransferases, particularly, fucosyltransferases and sialyltransferases to explain the exclusive detection of Lex in the neurons. In addition, we would like to know if there are some Lex-binding proteins that may act as binding partners of Lex in the neurons.
