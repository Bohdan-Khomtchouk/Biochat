TITLE
Epigenome analysis of uterin leiomyoma and myometrium with or without leiomyoma [Methylation data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiles of genome-wide DNA methylation were investigated in leiomyomas and in myometrium with and without leiomyomas.  Profiles of DNA methylation in the myometrium with and without leiomyomas were quite similar while those in leiomyomas were distinct.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the three uterine leiomyoma, three myometrium with leiomyoma and three myometrium without leiomyoma were hybridised to the Illumina infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.
