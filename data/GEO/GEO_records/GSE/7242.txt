TITLE
FDCPmix, ES cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hemotopoietical FDCPmix cell line stays as pluripotent cell line depend of IL3 treatment. Cytokine cocktails initiate terminal differentiation in myeloid cell. The cell line was transfected with MLL (leukaemia factor) causing in reaction with several transcription factors diverse tumors. Expression profiling analysis to get an insight into the mechanism of MML leukaemia factor. The factor is stimulated by Tamoxifen (OHT). On several time points after stimulation expression profiles were performed Keywords: FDCPmix, ES cells, murine, tumorigenesis, cDNA arrays

DESIGN
FDCPmix 4 time points (3h, 7h, 12h, 23h)after Tamoxifen treatment versus cells 0h after treatment, including 50% dye sway experiments

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
