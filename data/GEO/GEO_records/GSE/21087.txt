TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of the Calvaria from Conditional Hdac3 Defecient and Wild-type Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We utilized the Illumina MouseRef-8 gene expression technology to quantify differential gene expression between wildtype mice and mice with Osterix driven Cre conditional knockout of Hdac3 (Hdac3-CKO).  We compared the RNA extracted from calvaria from 8 wildtype and 8 conditional knockout litter matched mice using two separate Illumina MouseRef-8 chips.

DESIGN
Mice with exon 7 of Hdac3 flanked by loxP sites were crossed with mice expressing Cre driven by the Osterix promoter.  RNA from 5 day old mouse calvarial explants (digested for 20 minutes with collagenase) was purified using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using Qiagen’s Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit.  Two independent microarray experiments were performed; each experiment used RNA from four wildtype and four conditional knockout litter matched mouse calvaria.
