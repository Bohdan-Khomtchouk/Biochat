TITLE
The miRNA profiling in  PANC-1, PANC-1 GEM 100 and PANC-1 GEM1500 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gemcitabine has been a first-line therapeutic agent for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pancreatic cancer; however, acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine remains a major challenge. We analyzed miRNAs expression profiles by array-based miRNAs analysis between gemcitabineâ€“resistant (PANC-1/GEM) and parental PANC-1 cells.

DESIGN
The three PDAC cells including PANC-1, PANC-1 GEM 100 and PANC-1 GEM1500 were harvested and RNA were isolated. Two independent experiments were performed for each group.
