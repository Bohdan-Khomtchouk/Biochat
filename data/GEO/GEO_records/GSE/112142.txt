TITLE
Genome-wide map of H3K27me3 before and after AKBA treatment in HaCaT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the distribution of H3K4me3 before and after AKBA treatment to understand how small molecule AKBA affects the epigenetic state. To do this we performed ChIP-seq with an H3K27me3 antibody.

DESIGN
We compared genome-wide H3K27me3 profiles generated by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) between +AKBA and -AKBA conditions after 12 hours in HaCaT cells.

PLATFORM
GPL20795 HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens)
