TITLE
Ciliary neurotrophic factor induces genes associated with inflammatory response and gliosis in the retina: A gene profiling study of flow-sorted, Muller (glial) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our data suggest that CNTF remodels the transcription profile of MÃ¼ller (glial) cells leading to induction of networks associated with transcription, cell cycle regulation and inflammatory response. CNTF also appears to function as an inducer of gliosis in the retina. These studies provide new insights into the biological functions of cytokines in the retina.

DESIGN
Muller glial cells treated with CNTF for 1 and 3 days
