TITLE
Subpopulations of CD163 positive macrophages are classically activated in psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the transcriptional profile associated with macrophage polarization to M1 or M2, we cultured macrophages derived from monocytes for 7 days and treated them with IFNg, IL-4, TNF, LPS, and LPS+IFNg (n=7). Psoriasis lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies were included (n=5 pairs).

DESIGN
Comparison of the transcriptome of psoriasis with cytokine-treated macrophages.
