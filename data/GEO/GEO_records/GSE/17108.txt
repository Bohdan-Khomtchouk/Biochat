TITLE
A survey of gene expression in adult chicken tissues using a chicken 20K oligonucleotide microarray

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of eight normal adult chicken tissues in 10-week old brown (lohmann brown) hens, the eight tissues include brain, bursa of Fabricius, jejunum, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, thymus. Keywords: normal chicken tissues, transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
eight different normal chicken adult tissue types, five biological replicates per tissue, each individual sample was hybridized with a common reference pool (pool of RNA samples from all individual samples). All individual samples were labeled with Cy3, common reference was labeled with Cy5.
