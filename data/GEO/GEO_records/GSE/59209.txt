TITLE
Genome wide expession analysis of effect of Batf2 knock down in bone marrow derived macrophage cells stimulated with IFNg

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bmdm cells were differentiated for 10 days and harvested and culture in six well plate followed by transfection with Batf2 ShRNA. Media was replanished in every two days and on 10th day cells were stimulated with IFNg for 4 hrs. Total RNA was obtain after 4 hrs of stimulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was colloected from control ShRNA transfected Bmdm cells and Batf2 shRNA transfected Bmdm cells stimulated with/with out IFNg
