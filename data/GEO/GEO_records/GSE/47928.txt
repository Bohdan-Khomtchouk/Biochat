TITLE
Function of Pitx2 in postnatal heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pitx2 is the homeobox gene located in proximity to the human 4q25 familial atrial fibrillation locus. Pitx2 haploinsufficient mice are prone to pacing induced atrial fibrillation indicating that reduced Pitx2 promotes an arrhythmogenic substrate within the atrium. Here, we inactivated Pitx2 in postnatal heart and discovered that unstressed adult Pitx2 mutant mice had sinus node dysfunction with impaired atrial conduction, an arrhythmia closely associated with atrial fibrillation. A genome-wide search for Pitx2 transcriptional targets using ChIP-sequencing and RNA expression profiling shows that Pitx2 represses target genes encoding cell junction proteins, ion channels, and critical transcriptional regulators many of which have been implicated in human atrial fibrillation by genome wide association studies. Our findings unveil a Pitx2 postnatal arrhythmogenic function, novel Pitx2 target genes relevant to atrial fibrillation, and reveal that Pitx2 stabilizes the intercalated disc in postnatal atrium.
