TITLE
Strand specific sequencing illustrates the complex transcriptional response of Legionella pneumophila during infection

ORGANISM
Legionella pneumophila

SUMMARY
Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular human pathogen with a distinct biphasic lifestyle. One of its primary environmental hosts in the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and its infection by L. pneumophila mimics that seen in human macrophages. Here we present analysis of strand specific sequencing of the transcriptional response of L. pneumophila in broth growth and in infection of A. castellanii.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 infection and 3 broth growth time points

PLATFORM
GPL13156 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Legionella pneumophila)
