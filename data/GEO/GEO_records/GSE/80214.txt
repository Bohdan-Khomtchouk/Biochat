TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Legionella Pneumophila-infected A549 cells transfected with siRNA against TNFAIP2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we transfected A549 cells with siRNA against TNFAIP2, infected them with L. pneumophila and performed transcriptional profiling. We found enrichment of genes in pro-inflammatory pathways by Pathway Over-respresentation analysis upon infection. There was no significant change in gene expression that we could attribute specifically to the knockdown of TNFAIP2.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptional response of A549 cells to Legionella infection with concomitant TNFAIP2 knockdown
