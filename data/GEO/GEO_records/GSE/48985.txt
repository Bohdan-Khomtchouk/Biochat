TITLE
Comparative analysis of the small RNA transcriptome of four developmental stages of the Citrus red mite (Panonychus citri)

ORGANISM
Panonychus citri

SUMMARY
Total RNAs from the Citrus red mite at the embryo, larva, nymph and adult stages were used to construct small RNA libraries for Solexa sequencing. Several categories of sRNAs were identified, including 594 known microRNAs (miRNAs) grouped into 206 families and 31 novel miRNAs. In addition, according to bioinformatics analysis and S-Poly(T) miRNA assays, the expression level of many miRNAs varied among the developmental stages. Furthermore, the prediction of miRNAs target genes and their functional annotation indicated that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of multiple pathways in the Citrus red mite.

DESIGN
The total RNAs from embryo, larva, nymph and adult stages of Panonychus citri were used to construct small RNA libraries for Solexa sequencing. The data from Solexa sequencer (Illumina) was compared to identify small RNAs in different stages of Panonychus citri.
