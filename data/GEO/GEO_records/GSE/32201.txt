TITLE
Transcriptome of early postnatal brain development of eIF2B-R132H/R132H mutant mice relative to wild-types.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide mRNA expression in brains of wild-type and eIF2B-R132H/R132H mutant mice (Geva et al., BRAIN 133 (8), 2010) profiled at postnatal (P) days 1, 18 and 21 to reflect the early proliferative stage prior to white matter establishment (P1) and the peak of oligodendrocye differentiation and myelin synthesis (P18 and P21).

DESIGN
3 biological replicates (whole brain without the cerebellum) from each wild-type and eIF2B-R132H/R132H mutant mice at 3 postnatal (P) days 1, 18 and 21 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
