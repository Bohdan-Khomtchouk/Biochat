TITLE
3' RNA-seq of fly expressing cabut RNAi after exposure to different levels of sucrose

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Control (+/cbtE1-UAS-cbt RNAi) or cabut RNAi flies (Tim-gal4, UAS-cbt RNAi) were starved for 16 hours and then exposed to food containing different concentrations of sucrose: 0, 25, 50  and 100 %  for 18 hours. Fly heads  were collected, RNA was extracted and  RNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (Engreitz et al., 2013)

DESIGN
For each sucrose  concentration, two samples of cabut RNAi flies and one sample of control flies were sequenced.
