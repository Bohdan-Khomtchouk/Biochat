TITLE
Latent gammaherpesvirus 68 infection induces distinct transcriptional changes in different organs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous studies identified a role for latent herpesvirus infection in cross-protection to infection and exacerbation of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we compared the gene expression signature from livers, spleens and brains of mice infected with wild-type gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a mutant virus defective in the establishment of latency (ORF73.stop) or mockulum. We identified over 600 genes differentially expressed in organs of mice latently infected with MHV68 and found distinct sets of genes linked to different pathways were altered in spleen compared to liver. Several of the most differentially expressed latency-specific genes (e.g. IFNÎ³, Cxcl9, Ccl5) are associated with known latency-specific phenotypes.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from livers, spleens and brains of 7-9 week old male C57Bl/6 mice infected with gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a virus defective in establishment of latency (ORF73.stop) or mockulum. RNA from 3-4 mice per treatment was pooled and analyzed by M430 2.0 Affymetrix Gene Chip. Three biologic replicates were analyzed for all conditions, except mock livers, for which four biologic replicates were analyzed.
