TITLE
Genome-wide maps of HIF1a binding sites in ccRCC cell line under hypoxia condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing technology for  HIF1a binding sites at genome wide level  in a RCC (renal cell carcinoma) cell line under hypoxia conditions. We found HIF1a binding sites in Caki-2 cell line under hypoxia conditions. Especially, we found HIF1a bind to SPOP under hypoxia condition, which was further validated.
