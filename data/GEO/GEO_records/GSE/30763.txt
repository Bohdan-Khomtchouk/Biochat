TITLE
Integration of BRCA1-mediated miRNA and mRNA signatures reveal miR-146a, miR-99b and miR-205 regulation of the TRAF2 and NFkB pathways (miRNA dataset)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray‐based techniques are being used to obtain miRNA and gene expression signatures associated with different samples. In order to deepen our understanding of BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis, we integrated data from microarray experiments to obtain significant miRNA-mRNA relationships associated with the presence of the BRCA1 gene. We obtained significant miRNA-gene-pathway relationships underlying the array signatures. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that miR-146a, miR-99b and miR-205, induced in HCC1937 BRCA1-expressing cells, commonly regulate the TRAF2 gene, a key regulator of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. In addition, re-expression of miR-146a, miR-99b or miR-205 in HCC1937 BRCA1-null cells was sufficient to modulate NF-κB activity. Thus, integration between miRNA-mRNA expression data allowed us to define genes and pathways controlled by miRNAs induced in the context of BRCA1 expression.

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles between two isogenic cell lines differing in BRCA1 gene expression status. Single-color experiments in a pairwise comparison design with three technical replicates per cell line.
