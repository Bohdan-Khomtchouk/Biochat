TITLE
Response of human lymphoblastoid cells to HZE (iron ions) or gamma-rays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells comparing mock irradiated cells with cells exposed 24 hours previously to 1.67 Gy HZE (1 GeV/amu iron ions accelerated at the NASA Space Research Laboratory (NSRL) of Brookhaven National Laboratory) or 2.5 Gy 137Cs gamma rays.

DESIGN
TK6 cells were mock irradiated or exposed to HZE or gamma-rays, and RNA was harvested 24 hours later.  3 biological replicates were independently grown and harvested during three different runs at the NSRL. One replicate per array.
