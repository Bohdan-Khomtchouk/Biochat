TITLE
Expression data from chicken Pectoralis major

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Development of Pectoralis major has been investigated through gene expression analysis in comparing animals receiving a restricted diet in P and Ca (NC), a normal diet with sufficient level of P and Ca (PC), and a restricted diet supplemented with phytase (Phy1000). We used microarrays (ChiGene-1_0-st) to evaluate gene expression underlying pathways affectd by the diet and/or the phytase supplementation and to identify classes of differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Pectoralis major from chicken were sampled at day 36 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. 4 pools of 4 samples per treatment were used to identify potentially affected pathway related to the diet.
