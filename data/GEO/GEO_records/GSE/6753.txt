TITLE
Localization and mechanism of S. pombe histone demethylases

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-

SUMMARY
We profiled the genomic localization of two histone demethylases, LSD1 and LSD2 using ChIP-on-chip. Deletions in LSD2 are lethal but not in LSD1, so we examined effect of an lsd1 deletion on genomewide expression levels and localization patterns of H3me2K4 and H3me2K9 relative to wild-type. Keywords: mutant vs wild-type
