TITLE
Localization and mechanism of S. pombe histone demethylases

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We profiled the genomic localization of two histone demethylases, LSD1 and LSD2 using ChIP-on-chip. Deletions in LSD2 are lethal but not in LSD1, so we examined effect of an lsd1 deletion on genomewide expression levels and localization patterns of H3me2K4 and H3me2K9 relative to wild-type. Keywords: mutant vs wild-type

DESIGN
Each experiment (transcription or ChIP localization) was implemented as a reference design including a dye reversal. Additional statistical power is added by the fact that the all experimental spots on the array platform are printed in duplicate.
