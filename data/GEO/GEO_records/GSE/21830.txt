TITLE
A distinctive DNA damage response in human hematopoietic stem cells reveals an apoptosis independent role for p53 in self-renewal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in human Cord Blood cells cultured for 4 days and sorted into CD34+CD90+ and CD34+CD90- fractions. The objective for the experiment was to identify genes related to p53 and DNA damage response pathways

DESIGN
Total RNA  was isolated from at least 10000 cells after 4 days of culture and sorting
