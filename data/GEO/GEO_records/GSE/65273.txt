TITLE
A genome-wide analysis of PhoP~P binding to chromosomal DNA reveals several novel features of the PhoPR-mediated phosphate limitation response in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Identification of the specific PhoP binding regions on the B. subtilis chromosome during exponential and phosphate starvation growth phases. The data serves to extend the PhoPR regulon in Bacillus subtilis and its role in adaptation to phosphate-limiting conditions and cell wall metabolism, as well as implying a role in several other cellular processes.
