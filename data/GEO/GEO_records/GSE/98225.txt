TITLE
Long noncoding RNA expression profile in HLE B-3 cells during TGF-β2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent evidences have showed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) are involved in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To understand lncRNAs expression profile and potential functions in EMT of lens epithelial cells (HLE B-3), we investigated the lncRNA and mRNA expression in normal cells and TGF-β2 induced cells using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
lens epithelial cells (HLE B-3): control vs. TGF-β2 induced cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 induced replicates.
