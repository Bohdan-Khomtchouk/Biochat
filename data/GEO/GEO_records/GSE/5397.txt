TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of GSNO treated batch cultures of C. jejuni

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Batch cultures of Wild-type C. jejuni NCTC11168 were grown in 150 ml volumes of Mueller-Hinton broth in 250 ml baffled flasks. Microaerophilic conditions were generated using a MACS-VA500 microaerophilic work station (10 % O2, 10 % CO2, 80 % N2) from Don Whitley Scientific, Ltd which also maintained the growth temperature at 42 ºC. When mid-exponential phase was reached 0.25 mM GSNO was added to half of the cultures. After a 10 minute exposure samples of both treated and untreated cells were harvested into phenol/ethenol to stabilize the RNA and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit (as recommended by the suppliers) prior to use in microarray analysis.
