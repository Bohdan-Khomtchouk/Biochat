TITLE
Methylation DNA mediated KLF4 binding activity in glioblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq, ChIP seq and Whole genome bisulfite seq for KLF4-mCpG binding in GBM cells

DESIGN
We engineered two doxycycline-inducible U87 cell lines to express KLF4 wild type and mutant (R458A), and examined KLF4 binding, gene regulation and whole genome bisulfite seq in U87 cells
