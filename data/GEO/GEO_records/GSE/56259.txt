TITLE
The expression profile of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) in post-treatment breast carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metabolism of anticancer drugs markedly affects their antitumor effects. The major goal of our study was to investigate associations of gene expression of enzymes metabolizing taxanes and/or anthracyclines with therapy response and survival of breast carcinoma patients AKR1A1 was significantly overexpressed and AKR1C1-4, KCNAB1, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 downregulated in tumors compared with control non-neoplastic tissues after correction for multiple testing. Significant associations of CYP2B6 levels in tumors with expression of hormonal receptors were found. Significantly higher intratumoral levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and CYP2W1 were found in responders to NACT compared with non-responders. Patients with high AKR1C2 and CYP3A4 levels had significantly longer disease-free survival than patients with low levels.

DESIGN
Transcript levels of twenty-four selected human metabolic genes (CYPs and AKRs) were determined by qPCR in post-treatment tumor and non-neoplastic tissue samples from 68 breast carcinoma patients treated by anthracycline and/or taxane based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EIF2B1, MRPL19, IPO8, and UBB were used as reference genes for data normalization.
