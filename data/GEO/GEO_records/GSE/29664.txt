TITLE
DNA microarray analysis and functional profile of pituitary transcriptome under core-clock protein BMAL1 control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find BMAL1-regulated genes in mice pituitary gland we performed a differential microarray  from wild-type vs Bmal1-/- knock-out mice

DESIGN
Wild type and clock-deficient Bmal1-/- mice in the C57BL/6J were used at 8 to 12 weeks of age. All animals were housed in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (light/dark, 12:12). Mice were sacrificed by decapitation at ZT12 (light off), and three pools of three pituitaries per genotype were used to isolate total RNA. Pituitary glands taken from three mice from the same genotype were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen until total RNA isolation.
