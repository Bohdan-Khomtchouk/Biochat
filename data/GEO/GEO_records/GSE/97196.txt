TITLE
RNAseq profiling of AMCase-expressing lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated novel reporter mice (“ChiaRed”) to study the role of the acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) in lung homeostasis and in response to immune challenge.

DESIGN
Lung epithelial cells from wild-type mice (WT; n=3) and AMCase-expressing ChiaRed+ cells were isolated from the lungs of homozygous (CC; n=2) and heterozygous (C+; n=3) ChiaRed mice to compare differentially expressed transcripts by RNA-Seq analysis in these cells.
