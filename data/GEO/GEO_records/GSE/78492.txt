TITLE
small RNA-seq from NCI-H460 (ENCSR968YZV)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from cytoplasmic fractions of immortalized cell line NCI-H460 derived from a large cell lung carcinoma of a 37 year old male.  They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted TAP pretreated Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size.
