TITLE
University of Manitoba/MGCB2 C thermocellum RNA-seq Experiment

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum

SUMMARY
Determine overall gene expression profiles; RNA expression observed in stationary relative to exponential phase cells of strain Clostridum thermocellum (ATCC 27405) grown on cellobiose; Comparative RNA expression of 3 Clostridium thermocellu strains (DSM 1237, 2650, and 4150) grown to mid exponential phase on cellobiose; Verify whether observed differences in fermentation end-product ratios are reflected in differences in RNA expression profiles. RNA-seq data will be compared with the same experiments performed with proteomic experiments; Compare gene expression across relative strains.

DESIGN
Each test condition was provided as 2 biological replicates for primary strain and 1 replicate for comparing strain

PLATFORM
GPL17844 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Clostridium thermocellum)
