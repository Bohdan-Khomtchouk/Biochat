TITLE
Decrease of Parkin and CD36 expression and body weight correlate with an increase of non-esterified fatty acids in a mouse model for TDP-43 pathology

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TDP-43-coding mutations are found among ALS patients. In oder to express human mutant TDP-43 protein in the mouse under the control of the endogenous Tardp promoter, we have generate a mouse line wit 300% elevated TDP-43 level.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 4-6 male mutant mice was compared to 4-6 wild type controls.
