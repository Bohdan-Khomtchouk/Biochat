TITLE
Gene expression profiles for different tissues obtained from newly hatched (day 0) and 7 day-old broiler chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The embryo to neonate transition is a critical period of development that has significant impact on broiler production. During this time important genetic programs governing metabolism and growth are established. The goal of this work was to study the effects of early post-hatch (PH) development and time of initiation of feeding on activation of the genetic programs regulating tissue growth and metabolism in liver, brain, duodenum and breast muscle in broiler chickens. We used chicken genome GeneChip microarrays in a replicated experiment to detail the global program of gene expression in liver, whole brain, duodenum and breast muscle during the post-hatch transition in response to the initiation of feeding.
