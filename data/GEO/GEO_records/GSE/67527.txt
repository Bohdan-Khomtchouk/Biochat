TITLE
Gene expression comparison between fibroblasts samples of control and SPOAN affected patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: Analyze expression patterns of genes located at linkage region of SPOAN syndrome (11q12-13), in order to identify genes differentially expressed in samples of SPOAN individuals compared to healthy controls.

DESIGN
Fibroblast samples of 8 samples where analyzed: 4 SPOAN affected patients and 4 healthy controls. There are no replicates and there are not affected and control from the same patient.
