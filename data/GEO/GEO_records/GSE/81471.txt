TITLE
Expression data from ectopic PTHLH over-expression in Ca9-22 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exmaine the PTHLH stimulated genes in Ca9-22 cells, we preformed the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array with  empty vector or PTHLH expression vector. The raw data were normalized by GeneSpring GX software and up-load with raw values.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from empty vector or PTHLH expression Ca9-22 cells.
