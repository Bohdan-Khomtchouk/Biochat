TITLE
Integrating phenotypic and expression profiles to map arsenic response networks

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The parent S. cerevisiae strain, BY4741, and specific gene deletions of the parent S.cerevisiae strain BY4741 were treated with 100uM NaAsO2 (AsIII) for 2h and compared to the untreated counterpart (yap1Δ vs. yap1Δ 2h 100uM AsIII, cad1Δ vs. cad1Δ 2h 100uMAsIII, rpn4Δ vs. rpn4Δ 2h 100uM AsIII, arr1Δ vs. arr1Δ 2h 100uM AsIII, parent vs. parent with 2h 100uM AsIII).  The untreated specific deletion strain was also compared to the untreated parent strain in order to identify differential expression of genes due to the knockout alone. Keywords: other
