TITLE
Wild type H37Rv vs HtpX mutant. Heat shocked samples

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
This experiment examines the differences in global gene expression in a wild type and mutant strain grown under standard shaking conditions to mid log phase (OD600 0.5) followed by heat shock at 50C for 15 minutes.

DESIGN
3 repeats were performed. Trizol was used to prep the RNA. TIGR protocols were closely followed.
