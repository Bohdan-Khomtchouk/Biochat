TITLE
Expression data from ES cell-derived motoneuron

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural formation from ES cells provides a novel system for studying axonogenesis in projection neurons. We used microarrays to clarify the global gene expression patterns of ES-derived motoneurons and compared with the parental undifferentiated ES cells.

DESIGN
HB9-GFP ES cells on day 7 were mechanically pipetted into small cell clumps and concentrated to a density of approximately 1×104 cells/μl in neural differentiation medium. The animals received total laminectomy from T8 to T10. Total RNA was extracted from the undifferentiated ES cells (1531), the sorted HB9-GFP+ cells (1557), the sorted sox1 neural stem cells (1602) and the mouse cerebellar granule cells (1532) on postnatal day 6 and performed hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
