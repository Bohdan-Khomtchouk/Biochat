TITLE
Influence of Water Chemistry on Toxicogenomics of Chronic Lead Toxicity to the Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas)

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
Despite major successes in reducing the risks of lead (Pb) exposure over the past few decades, two issues of considerable importance remain unresolved:  (1) how differences in water chemistry influence acute and chronic Pb toxicity, and (2) the elucidation of specific toxic mechanisms and modes of action (MOA). To more clearly define the water chemistry parameters mediating Pb toxicity we evaluated the effects of hardness (as CaSO4) and DOC (as humic acid (HA)) during chronic (150d) exposures to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).  Traditional toxicological endpoints were examined alongside gene expression analyses to help clarify the underlying mechanisms and MOA of Pb toxicity and to identify robust molecular markers of exposure and effect. Keywords: time course, chronic lead (Pb) exposure

DESIGN
To analyze the gene expression responses to low-level Pb exposures fish were exposed +/- Pb in low ionic strength base water and fish collected at 2d, 4d, 10d, and 30d for microarray analysis.  Equal amounts of RNA from all no lead controls were pooled (18 fish total for 2d & 4d exposures; 12 fish total for 10d & 30d exposures) as reference samples for hybridization with each of 3 separate biological replicate pools (6 fish total for 2d & 4d exposures; 4 fish total for 10d & 30d exposures) of RNA from age-matched, lead-exposed fish.  Each pair of hybridizations was repeated with dye-swaps.  Additional repeats were performed for various arrays to ensure quality of data obtained from initial hybridization.
