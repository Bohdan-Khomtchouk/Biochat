TITLE
Influence of Water Chemistry on Toxicogenomics of Chronic Lead Toxicity to the Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas)

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
Despite major successes in reducing the risks of lead (Pb) exposure over the past few decades, two issues of considerable importance remain unresolved:  (1) how differences in water chemistry influence acute and chronic Pb toxicity, and (2) the elucidation of specific toxic mechanisms and modes of action (MOA). To more clearly define the water chemistry parameters mediating Pb toxicity we evaluated the effects of hardness (as CaSO4) and DOC (as humic acid (HA)) during chronic (150d) exposures to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).  Traditional toxicological endpoints were examined alongside gene expression analyses to help clarify the underlying mechanisms and MOA of Pb toxicity and to identify robust molecular markers of exposure and effect. Keywords: time course, chronic lead (Pb) exposure
