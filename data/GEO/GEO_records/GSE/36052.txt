TITLE
Identification of Conserved and Novel MicroRNAs in Cashmere Goat (Capra hircus) by Deep Sequencing

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
The study confirmed a batch of goat skin and hair follicles miRNA, by high-throughput sequencing methods.316 sequences miRNAs were obtained by the means of analysis and we confirmed the authenticity of 68 known miRNAs and discovered 248 novel miRNAs, as well as 22 miRNAs that havenâ€™t been reported before. Through the miRNAs family analysis, we found the co-expressed miRNAs in goat and sheep located in the same region of chromosome, which may play an essential role in skin and follicle development. In addition, the prediction of novel target miRNAs followed by the analysis of target gene pathways indicated that MAPK pathway may have an important effect to the fast growth of skin follicle cell.

DESIGN
We sequenced a mixed sample which contains three goat skin in anagen of cashmere

PLATFORM
GPL15270 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Capra hircus)
