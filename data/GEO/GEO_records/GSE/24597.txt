TITLE
Gene expression profile of probiotic Lactobacillus casei Zhang during the late stage of milk fermentation

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus casei str. Zhang

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus casei Zhang is a probiotic bacterium isolated from koumiss in Inner Mongolia of China that has been commercially used as a starter in the manufacture of dairy products. To study the gene expression profiles of L. casei Zhang during growth in milk, a whole-genome microarray was used. Compared to L. casei Zhang grown to late logarithmic phase in milk, 61 genes were significantly up-regulated ( > 5 fold) in stationary phase, whereas 26 genes were down-regulated. Collectively, these data showed that the majority of the identified genes was involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, followed by genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, inorganic ion transport, amino acid transport and metabolism, chaperone, etc. This study demonstrates the fundamental effects of cultural conditions on the transcriptome of L. casei Zhang. Moreover, it improves the understanding of the growth and survival mechanism of the bacterium during the late stage of milk fermentation.

DESIGN
L. casei Zhang was grown in milk for 14h (late logarithmic phase) or 18h (stationary phase). 2 biological replicates each.
