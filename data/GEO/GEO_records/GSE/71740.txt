TITLE
Inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase KDM1A are broadly efficacious in AML by evicting the enzyme from chromatin [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigating the effects of two different classes of KDM1A inhibitors on the transcriptome of AML cell lines

DESIGN
16 different samples with biological replicates.  Treatment for 24 and 72 hours with an irreversible KDM1A inhibitor (RN-1) or a reversible KDM1A inhibitor (GSK690) or an inactive isomer of the latter (GSK690*).
