TITLE
The gene expression of aromatase-inhibitor-resistant cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes which have relation to aromatase-inhibitor-resistance, we compared the gene expression of aromatase-inhibitor-resistant cell, A3, with that of parent cell line, T-47D.

DESIGN
Because A3 showed remarkable cell proliferation by 1nM Dihydrotestosterone(DHT), cells were cultured with DHTand bicalutamide for 24h, and total RNA was extracted.
