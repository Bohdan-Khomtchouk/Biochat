TITLE
Effect of antimicrobial peptide PR-39 on the gene expression of porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To gain a more complete understanding of how porcine cathelicidin PR-39 influence the  porcine intestinal epithelial cells, we profiled gene expression patterns in IPEC-J2 cell line in the presence or the absence of PR-39.

DESIGN
two groups(control and PR-39),each group has three replicates
