TITLE
Temporal expression profiling of Arterial Remodeling in Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We explored the global expression profile of the arterialized rat jugular vein to identify candidate genes and cellular pathways underlying the arterialization remodeling process.

DESIGN
CodeLink Rat Bioarrays were assayed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction on total RNA extracted from arterialized vein segments. They were collected at 3 days (n=3) and 28 days (n=3) after surgery. Normal jugular veins (n=5) and carotid arteries (n=2) were used as controls (references of heathy tissues).
