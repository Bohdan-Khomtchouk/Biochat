TITLE
The lncRNA microarray analysis of 16HBE cell treated with PM2.5 samples in Guangzhou

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to assess the alteration of lncRNA expression in 16HBE cell treated with PM2.5 samples, we determined the lncRNA expression profiles in 16HBE cell treated with PBS (control group) and PM2.5 samples (low dose 125 μg/mL and high dose 500 μg/mL) using  lncRNA Microarray.

DESIGN
16HBE Cells were treated with PM2.5 suspension at concentration of 125 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL, and PBS was used in the control group for 48 h. Then, total RNAs were extracted  for lncRNA chip preparation and analysis.
