TITLE
Zebrafish embryos: hdac1 Morphants vs Standard control morphants

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of hdac1 morphant zebrafish embryos in comparison to standard control injected embryos.  Embryos where injected at the one cell stage with either a translation blocking morpholino (Hdac1 ATG), splice blocking morpholino (Hdac1 Splice) or Hdac1 mismatch control morpholino (Hdac1 control).  RNA was extracted and compared in a two-colour hybridisation to the comman reference Standard control morpholino injected embryos.

DESIGN
Common reference experiment, hdac1 morphants vs. standard control morphants. Biological replicates: 2 (except Splice which was technical rather than biological)
