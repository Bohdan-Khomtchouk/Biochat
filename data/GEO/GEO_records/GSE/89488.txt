TITLE
Effect of AK144841 SiRNAs on the whole transcriptome of a mouse cell line (mSCC-38 cells) isolated from chemically-induced skin carcinoma (SCC )  (DMBA/TPA model)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims at demonstrating that a newly identified LncRNA AK144841, strongly up-regulated in mouse  skin carninoma , is effectivelly endowed of a biological activity and  could play a role in the tumor development. Here we used siRNA to invalidate AK144841 and  analyse the consequences of this manipulation on the  transcriptome of mouse SCC cell line  This approach will also permit to  to identify potential target of this LncRNA.

DESIGN
Cultured mSCC-38 cells were transfected with 2 distinct siRNA (Si1AK and Si2AK) or a control siRNA (SiC) using RNAimax. After 72hrs in culture cells were harvested , RNA were extracted and purified. 600ng of Cy3 labelled ARN were hybridized with a 8x60k Agilent array. Non tranfected cells were also included in the experiment.
