TITLE
Beta cell 5â€™-shifted isomiRs are candidate regulatory hubs in type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed deep sequencing of small RNA from mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells cultured in 25mM glucose. We then developed and implemented an in-house short-read mapping strategy to analyze isomiR diversity.

DESIGN
Profile of miRNA expression in MIN6 cells cultured in 25mM glucose.
