TITLE
Human DNA methylation profiles for the HBV vaccine responses study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Twenty five infants received HBV vaccination and were classified as good or poor responders according to their responses, the number being 12 and 13 respectively. PBMC cells were extracted and epigenome-wide DNA methylation levels were measureed using Illumina Infinium 450K HumanMethylation beadchips.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 25 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
