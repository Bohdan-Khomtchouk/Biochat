TITLE
Decoding the global transcriptomic profile under extreme manganese toxicity

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To achieve extreme manganese stress, we used DmntP E. coli strain. We identified the pathways that are altered under manganese stress. Mainly, manganese altered the metabolism of iron in the cell. Therefore, we have shown that iron supplementation mitigates manganese toxicity. Overall, our data explains the basis of manganism in higher organisms.

DESIGN
Escherichia coli were grown in LB, LB + manganese, or LB + manganese + iron.
