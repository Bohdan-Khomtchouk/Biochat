TITLE
CD95L derived si- and shRNAs and the CD95L mRNA kill cancer cells through an RNAi mechanism by targeting survival genes [siL3.RNAseq.lg]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We provide evidence that shRNAs and siRNAs derived from CD95 and CD95L preferentially target the 3' UTRs of survival genes culminating in a very robust mode of cell death we call DISE (Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination)

DESIGN
RNA isolated from HeyA8 cells 48 hrs after transfection with either a nontargeting siRNA (siScr) or a CD95L derived siRNAs (siL3) were subjected to deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq4000.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
