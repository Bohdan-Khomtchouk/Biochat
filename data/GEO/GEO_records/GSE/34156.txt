TITLE
Human monocyte activation with NOD2L vs. TLR2/1L

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human blood monocytes were isolated, activated and harvested at several timepoints In this study, we identified genes that were differentially expressed in human monocytes activated with eiter NOD2L and/or TLR2/1L.

DESIGN
human blood monocytes were purified from healthy donors by Ficoll, Percoll and adherence. Monocytes were activated using NOD2L (MDP) and the TLR2/1L (19kD, triacylated peptide). Cells were harvested before activation (0h) and 6h and 24h after stimulation with ligands.
