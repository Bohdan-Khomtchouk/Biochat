TITLE
DNA methylation patterns in twins discordant for ALS reveal concordant signatures of disease [RRBS]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data suggest twin pair specific methylation differences exist in blood that reside in genes that are enriched for neuronal pathways.

DESIGN
methylation profiling by RRBS, of 5 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ALS

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
