TITLE
Complementary Strand MicroRNAs Mediate Acquisition of Metastatic Potential in Colonic AdenocarcinomamRNA and microRNA profile in colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With broad high-throughput evaluation of microRNA expression across the spectrum of colon cancer stages, we identidied a microRNA signature that is associated with more aggressive disease

DESIGN
microRNA was extracted from FFPE colon tissues for microRNA array analysis
