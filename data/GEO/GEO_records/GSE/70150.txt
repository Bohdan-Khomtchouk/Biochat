TITLE
Time course of androgen-regulated transcripts in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the AR signaling, we performed RNA sequence analysis in AR positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP.

DESIGN
RNA sequence analysis of androgen-regulated transcripts in prostate cancer cells

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
