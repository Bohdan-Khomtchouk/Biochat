TITLE
Differences in gastric carcinoma microenvironment stratify according to EBV infection intensity; implications for possible immune adjuvant therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal of this study was to perform quantitative and global assessment of EBV gene expression in gastric carcinomas and assess EBV associated cellular pathway alterations.

DESIGN
Examination of a gastric carcinoma cell line naturally infected with EBV, SNU-719 using poly-A and ribodepletion RNA-seq data sets
