TITLE
DNA damage Signaling Pathway PCR Array to profile the expression of human genes regulating in the DNA damage response (DDR) network

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA Damage Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler Array Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to profile the expression of key genes involved in the DDR network as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
U937 cells were incubated with PXD-101 +/- MLN4924 for 16 h, after which the RT2 ProfilerTM DNA damage Signaling Pathway PCR Array was performed to profile the expression of 84 human genes involved in the DDR network.
