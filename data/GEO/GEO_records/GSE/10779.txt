TITLE
NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase (hNAT5) inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Search for genes differently expressed when we inhibit NatB N-terminal acetyltransferase. We compare gene expression after inhibiting hNAT5 expression in Hela cells with specific siRNAs expressed with adenoviruses. Keywords: gene expression comparison
