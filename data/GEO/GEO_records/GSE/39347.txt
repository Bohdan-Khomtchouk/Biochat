TITLE
Arabidopsis hsi2 vs. Col-0 Drought Arrays

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rossette leaves comparing wild type (Col-0) and the mutant (hsi2-5) under no drought or simulated drought stress.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment; wild type (col-0) vs. mutant (hsi2-5). Three stages of drought; no drought (or stage 0), mild drought or soil drying but no visible wiliting (or stage 1), visible wilting (stage 2). At stage 0, four biological replicates of the wild type/mutant co-hybridized, at stage 1 and stage 2, three biological replicates of the wild type/mutant co-hybridized.
