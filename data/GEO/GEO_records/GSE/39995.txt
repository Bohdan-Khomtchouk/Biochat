TITLE
Gene expression analysis of B-ALL cells treated with BET inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were treated with a BET bromodomain inhibitor that blocks BET association with chromatin. These cell lines, MHH-CALL4 and MUTZ-5, each carry translocation of the CRLF2 gene into the IgH locus, and their growth was found to be susceptible to BET inhibition. Gene expression changes were analyzed in each cell line versus vehicle control.

DESIGN
Cell were treated for 8 hours with either DMSO or 500nM of the BET bromodomain inhbitor JQ1. Three samples for each treatment were taken and analyzed for each cell line. CEL files were analyzed at both the core and extended gene level by RMA with the Affymetrix Expression Console software.
