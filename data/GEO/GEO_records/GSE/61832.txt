TITLE
Gene expression changes induced in Rice (Oryza sativa) leaves by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strain BXO43

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Lipopolysaccharide is a Microbe Associated Molecular Pattern (MAMP) that is known to induce defense responses in plants. We have shown that treatment of rice leaves with Xoo LPS induces callose deposition, reactive oxygen production and enhances resistance against subsequent infection by the pathogen. We have performed transcriptional profiling of rice leaves that are treated with Xoo LPS to identify differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Xoo LPS was injected into mid-veins of rice leaves and RNA was isolated 15 hours later.

PLATFORM
