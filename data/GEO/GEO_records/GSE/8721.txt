TITLE
Novel regions of acquired uniparental disomy discovered in acute myeloid leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The acquisition of uniparental disomy (aUPD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in homozygosity for known gene mutations. Uncovering novel regions of aUPD has the potential to identify previously unknown mutational targets, therefore, we aimed to develop a comprehensive map of the regions of aUPD in AML. Here, we have analyzed a large set of diagnostic AML samples (n=455) using genotype arrays. Acquired UPD was found in 17% of the samples with a non-random distribution particularly affecting chromosomes 13q, 11p and 11q. Novel recurrent regions of aUPD were uncovered at 2p, 17p, 2q, 17q, 1p and Xq. Overall, aUPDs were observed across all cytogenetic risk groups, although samples with aUPD13q (5.4% of samples) belonged exclusively to the intermediate-risk group. All cases with a high FLT3-ITD level, measured previously, had aUPD13q covering the FLT3 gene. Of the 120 aUPDs observed, the majority (87%) were due to mitotic recombination while only 13% were due to non-disjunction. This study demonstrates aUPD is a frequent and significant finding in AML and pinpoints regions that may contain novel mutational targets. Keywords: Genomic analysis of AML samples
