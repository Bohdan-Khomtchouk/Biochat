TITLE
Auxin-independent NAC pathway regulates cell wall metabolism in response to explant-specific wounding during regeneration in Arabidopsis I

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study, through a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of wounding in the leaf explant, we identified NAC1 (petunia NAM and Arabidopsis ATAF1, ATAF2, and CUC2) family transcription factor gene  that acts in response to wounding and functions in regulation of cell wall metabolism.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of the genes up-regulated by NAC1

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
