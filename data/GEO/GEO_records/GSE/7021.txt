TITLE
Chorionic villi cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the chorionic villi of placenta, trophoblasts and endothelial cells are present, and moreover mesenchymal cells (stromal cells) can be obtained. We generated cells with the mesenchymal phenotype from the chorionic mesoderm, and showed that: a) physiologically functioning cardiomyocytes were transdifferentiated from human placenta-derived chorionic villi cells, but these cells did not induce to osteoblasts and adipocytes ; b) the cardiomyogenic induction rate obtained using our system was relatively high compared to that obtained using the previously described method ; c) co-cultivation with fetal murine cardiomyocytes alone without transdifferentiation factors such as 5-azaC or oxytocin is sufficient for cardiomyogenesis in our system; d) Chorionic villi cells have the electrophysiological properties of 'working' cardiomyocytes.  The chorionic mesoderm contained a large number of cells with a cardiomyogenic potential. Keywords: Cardiomyogenic induction
