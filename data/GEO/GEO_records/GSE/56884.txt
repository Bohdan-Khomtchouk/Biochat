TITLE
Array based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis of 1 Mb resolution of 21 follicular lymphomas (FL), 31 transformed diffuse large B-cells lymphomas (DLBCL), 29 de novo DLBCL (10 of GC and 19 non-GC related immunophenotype).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common types of indolent B-cell lymphoma in Western countries. FL commonly transforms to more aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at reported frequencies between 15 - 60%. We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) at 1 Mb resolution to study copy number changes in paired tumor samples (primary FL and a subsequent tDLBCL) as well as de novo DLBCL cases to outline genetic mechanisms of transformation from follicular lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

DESIGN
Single hybridization per case. 21 FL, 31 transformed DLBCL, 29 de novo DLBCL (10 GC and 19 non-GC DLBCL). Tumor labelled with Cy5 and reference with Cy3. Mixture of 20 normal male or female genomic DNA was used in sex-mismatched hybridization.
