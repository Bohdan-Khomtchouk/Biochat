TITLE
In vivo analysis of astrocyte ribosome-associated mRNA after traumatic spinal cord injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression by astrocytes or non-astrocyte cells in spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions may lead to the identification of molecules that impact on axon regrowth. We conducted genome-wide RNA sequencing of (i) immunoprecipitated astrocyte-specific ribosome-associated RNA (ramRNA) from WT or STAT3-CKO astrocytes, and (ii) the non-precipitated (flow-through) RNA deriving from non-astrocyte cells in the same tissue samples 14 days following SCI.

DESIGN
Young adult female mGFAP-Cre-RiboTag or mGFAP-Cre-RiboTag-STAT3-LoxP mice underwent severe crush SCI at thoracic level 10. 14 days following SCI, the central 3mm of the SCI lesion was extracted, homogenized and (i) astrocyte-specific ribosome-associated RNA (ramRNA) precipitated via a hemagglutinin (HA) tag targeted to either WT (n=4) or STAT3-CKO (n=3) astrocytes, and (ii) the non-precipitated (flow-through) RNA deriving from non-astrocyte cells in the same tissue samples. Sex and age-matched mGFAP-Cre-RiboTag mice served as uninjured controls (n=4).
