TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiling of zebrafish embryos after 3-hour 0.1% DMSO or 25 µM Beclomethasone treatment

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To uncover the genes regulated by pharmacological activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor, we performed microarray-based expression profiling of whole zebrafish embryos at 24 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) after 3-hour treatment with 25 µM of Beclomethasone, a potent glucocorticoid previously tested in zebrafish or with 0.1 % DMSO as control.

DESIGN
Embryos at 24 and 72 hpf stages were treated with either 0.1 % DMSO or 25 µM Beclomethasone for 3 hours in triplicate experiments and then frozen for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
