TITLE
Whole transcriptomic analysis of B16 tumor environment 14 days after tumor inoculation in the absence of regulatory T cells (Treg)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of weakly immunogenic, B16 tumor environment at gene expression level after Treg depletion

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Treg-depleted tumor environment (PC61 group) was compared with PBS-treated tumor environment (PBS group)
