TITLE
Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation is enriched on the inactive X and plays a role in its epigenetic silencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the DNA methylation state of wildtype female mouse embryonic fibroblasts with nonsilencing shRNA mediated knockdown and Setdb1 geneTrap heterozygous cells with Setdb1 shRNA mediated knockdown. Methods: Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Libraries (eRRBS) were produced as previously descirbed (Akalin et al. 2012). Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for 100 bp single-end reads with dark cycle parameters (Boyle et al. 2012). Image analysis was performed in real time by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) v1.4.8 and Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.12.4.2, running on the instrument computer. Real-time base calling on the HiSeq instrument computer was performed with the RTA software. Illumina CASAVA1.8 pipeline was used to generate the sequence data.

DESIGN
Determine the DNA methylation state of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with wildtype MEFs and nonsilencing shRNA mediated knockdown or Setdb1 geneTrap heterozygous MEFs with Setdb1 shRNA mediated knockdown. Single-end with dark cycle protocol (Boyle et al. 2012)
