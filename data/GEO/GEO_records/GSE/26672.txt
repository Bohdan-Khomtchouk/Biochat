TITLE
Efficient Generation of Transgene-Free Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Normal and Neoplastic Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
global gene expression were compared among human blood iPSC, human fibroblas iPSC, human embryonic stem cells, human bone marrow MNC and human forskin fibroblast Reprogramming blood cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a novel tool for modeling blood diseases in vitro. we demonstrated that iPSCs free of transgene and vector sequences could be efficiently generated from human bone marrow and cord blood mononuclear cells using non-integrating episomal vectors. The reprogramming described here is up to 100 times more efficient, occurs 1 to 3 weeks faster as compared to the reprogramming of fibroblasts, and does not require isolation of progenitors or multiple rounds of transfection. This approach provides an opportunity to explore banked normal and diseased cord blood and bone marrow samples without the limitations associated with virus-based methods.

DESIGN
Compare the global gene expression of iPSs from different sources, ESCs and Somatic cells
