TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis CLIB214 culture in low iron conditions

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarrays were used to generate the transcriptional profile of Candida parapsilosis in low iron conditions

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from CLIB214 grown in SD medium and in SD medium supplemented with 200 Î¼M BPS and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Seven independent biological replicates were compared. Three dye swaps were perfomed so that four out of seven samples grown in SD culture were labeled with Cy3, and 3 were labeled with Cy5.
