TITLE
Liver kinase B1 deletion effect on brown adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) isolated from wildtype (WT) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) deletion mice (Ad/LKB1). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying paralysis of Ad/LKB1 mice

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, WT BAT vs. Ad-LKB1 BAT. Biological replicates: 3 WT replicates, 3 Ad-LKB1 replicates. 3 x 2-color arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
