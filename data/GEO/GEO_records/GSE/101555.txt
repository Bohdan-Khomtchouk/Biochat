TITLE
Gene expression profiling of S2 cells and S2 cells expressing AbdA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sought to determine the genes regulated by the Drosophila Hox protein AbdA in a homogenous cell system. S2-DRSC cells that have no Hox expression were stably transfected with HA-tagged AbdA under the control of a metallothionein promoter.

DESIGN
S2-DRSC cells are stably transfected with HA-tagged AbdA (S2-DRSC:AbdA). S2 and S2-AbdA cells are analysed for gene expression in the absence (S2-DRSC) and presence (S2-DRSC-HA::AbdA) of AbdA
