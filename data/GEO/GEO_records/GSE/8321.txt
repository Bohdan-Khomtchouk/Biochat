TITLE
Soleus muscle response to level running

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study surveyed expression of genes which might be involved in regulating the satellite cell response to non-damaging exercise. Low density cDNA arrays were used to survey expression of selected cytokines and growth factors in the soleus muscle following 60 minutes of level running. Keywords: Exercise response; pre versus 24-hr post
