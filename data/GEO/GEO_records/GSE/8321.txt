TITLE
Soleus muscle response to level running

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study surveyed expression of genes which might be involved in regulating the satellite cell response to non-damaging exercise. Low density cDNA arrays were used to survey expression of selected cytokines and growth factors in the soleus muscle following 60 minutes of level running. Keywords: Exercise response; pre versus 24-hr post

DESIGN
Five-mo-old male Fisher 344 rats were assigned to an unexercised control group (n = 7) or to an exercise group (n = 5).  The exercise group performed 60 minutes of level treadmill running (19 m/min) and were sacrificed 24 hours later.
