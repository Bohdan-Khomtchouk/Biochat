TITLE
Expression data for Fat storage inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2/FITM2)-deleted small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen- induced FIT2 deletion using whole body inducible ROSA26CreERT2 FIT2 floxed mice causes upregulation of the p53 pathway which accompanies intestinal death We used microarrays to detail the changes in small intestine gene expression at day 2, 3, and 5 of tamoxifen induced FIT2 deletion in whole body inducible ROSA26CreERT2 FIT2 floxed mice.

DESIGN
Small intestine was harvested from L/L and ROSA26CreERT2 L/L mice at days 2, 3, and 5 post- tamoxifen treatment and subject to microarray analysis. Pooled intestinal RNA from n biological replicates were used for each genotype and timepoint. D2 L/L n=6, D2 KO n=7, D3 L/L n=6, D3 KO n=6, D5 L/L n=8, D5 KO n=7.
