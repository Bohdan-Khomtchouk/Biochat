TITLE
The effect of nicotinamide on dysregulated genes associated with frataxin deficiency in FRDA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the efficacy of nicotinamide treatment using our ex-vivo primary lymphocyte model, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on libraries generated from untreated and nicotinamide treated samples.

DESIGN
PBMC isolated from FRDA affected individuals were cultured to prepare the primary lymphocyte cell lines. The primary cultured cells were either treated with 10mM nicotinamide or without the addition of drug during the 3-days treatment. RNA was extracted after the treatment and then RNA-seq libraries were generated by standard protocols.
