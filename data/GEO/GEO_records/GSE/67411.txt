TITLE
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profile in Huh7 cells treated with siRNA targeting nuclear factor 90 (siNF90)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous study has showed that complex of NF90 and nuclear factor 45 (NF45) (NF90-NF45) inhibits miRNA biogenesis through negative regulation of primary-miRNA processing step. On the other hand, miRNAs, the biogenesis of which is regulated by NF90-NF45 in hepatocellular carcinoma, are not clear. Thus, to identify the miRNAs, we performed a miRNA array using RNAs extracted from control Huh7 cells and the cells depleted of NF90.

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression profile in one non-targeting control siRNA (siNTC)- or two independent siNF90-treated Huh7 cells.
