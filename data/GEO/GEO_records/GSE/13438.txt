TITLE
Bisulfite Methylation Profiling (BiMP) analysis of met1-3 epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Epigenomic mapping of DNA methylation polymorphisms segregating within an epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Line population resultant from crossing the wild-type Col-0 and DNA maintenance methyltransferase mutant, met1-3, parental lines. Each line within the epiRIL population was self-fertilized for 7 generations, 10 individual F7 plants were then bulk harvested to create the F8 generation. Here, data files for three DNA methylation profiled epiRIL lines (epi01, epi12, epi28) are deposited. The DNA methylation polymorphisms were determined using the BiMP method with the Affymetrix Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R array. The main objective for these samples was to create an epigenomic map to analyze the inheritance of DNA methylation polymorphisms within these three epiRIL entries. Keywords: Bisulfite Methylation Profiling (BiMP) by genome tiling array
