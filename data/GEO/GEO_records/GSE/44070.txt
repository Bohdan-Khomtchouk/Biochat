TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profile of Intestinal (COLON) Tumors from APCmin/+/VP16LXRa vs APCmin/+/VP16

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes in gene expression profile of intestinal (COLON) Tumors from APCmin/+/VP16LXRa vs APCmin/+/VP16.  The hypothesis tested in the present study was that LXRa overexpression influence cancer growth modulating lipid metabolism in cancer cells. Results provide the information that LXRa induces expression of genes encoding proteins able to regulate cholesterol efflux.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from colonic tumors from APCmin/+/VP16LXRa mice was compared to total RNA extracted from APCmin/+/VP16 mice.
