TITLE
MoDCs grown with/without Etanercept TNF inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The process for making monocyte derived DCs (moDCs) has been previously described (46).  All analysis was performed on “day 5” immature DCs.  Etanercept 10mg/mL was added to experimental wells on days 0, 2, and 4.  We chose this concentration of etanercept as it approximates the plasma concentration of drug when given 50mg BIW. Keywords: Inhibition assay

DESIGN
6 totoal samples.  3 control replicates paired with 3 experimental replicates.
