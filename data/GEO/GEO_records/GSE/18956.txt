TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells after knockdown of either BMPRII or beta-catenin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of genes potentially regulated by BMPRII and beta-catenin. BMPRII has been linked as a genetic factor to the disease pulmonary arterial hypertension.

DESIGN
Comparison of total mRNA obtained from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells treated with control, bone morphogentic protein receptor II, or beta-catenin siRNA
