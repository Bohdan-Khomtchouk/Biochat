TITLE
Maternal Obesity is Associated with Ovarian Inflammation and Up-regulation of Early Growth Response Factor (Egr)-1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Maternal obesity during the pre-implantation period leads to a pro-inflammatory milieu in the ovaries. We conducted a global transcriptomic profiling in ovaries from TEN fed rats during  the pre-implantation period.   Microarray analysis revealed that obesity lead to  increased expression of genes related to inflammation, decreased glucose transporters, and dysregulation of ovarian function-related genes in the ovaries. Our results suggest maternal obesity led to an up-regulation of inflammatory genes and Egr-1 protien expression in peri-implantation ovarian tissue, and a concurrent down-regulation of glucose transporters mRNA and AKT and PI3K protein levels.

DESIGN
Lean vs. overfed ovaries
