TITLE
Microarray analysis of xenograft model to characterize the CNS leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a detailed genetic, transcriptional and physiological study of leukemic cells isolated from the CNS and bone marrows (BM) of both affected children and xenograft model of B-ALL which recapitulate the key features of CNS involvement. We reveal that leukemic cells in CNS possess distinct hypoxic signature such as proliferation suppression, decrease of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increase of glycolysis compared with leukemic cells in BM.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of leukemic cells isolated from organs of xenograft recipients from 4 patients (ALL#1-4) with microarrays.
