TITLE
Identification of genes downregulated due to loss at 8p11.22-ter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared expression profiles between pancreatic cell lines with and without loss at 8p11.22-ter to identify genes downregulated due to loss at 8p11.22-ter.

DESIGN
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines with loss at 8p11.22-ter (n = 8) vs pancreatic carcinoma cell lines without loss at 8p11.22-ter (n = 4)

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
