TITLE
Expression profile of crp-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of crp (TTHA1437) deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TT) medium at 70 degC

DESIGN
Three crp-deletion mutant T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70 degC. Cells were collected after 6 h and 8 h, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample in this website.
