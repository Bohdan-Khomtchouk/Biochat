TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in normal and fibrotic mouse kidneys with and without Twist1 or with and without Snai1(Snail) expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study mice were engineered to specifically delete Twist1 or Snail expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells of the kidney (ggt-cre+;Twist flox/flox and ggt-cre+;Snail flox/flox ). These mice and control mice (ggtcre-;Twist flox/flox: these express Twist1, and ggtcre-;Snail flox/flox:these express Snail) were subjected to unilaterial ureteric obstruction. This experiment allows for the collection and analysis of expression in contralateral healthy (HK) kidney adn obstructed disease (DK) kidney.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the contralateral healthy (HK) and obstructed disease (DK) kidneys of 3 mice with ggt-cre-;Twist flox/flox genotype (Wildtype like) and 4 mice with ggt-cre+;Twist flox/flox genotype (loss of Twist1 in proximal tubular epithelial cells), 3 mice with ggt-cre-;Snail flox/flox genotype (Wildtype like) and 3 mice with ggt-cre+;Snail flox/flox genotype (loss of Snail in proximal tubular epithelial cells). Total RNA was also isolated from kidneys of completely healthy mice: 3 mice ggt-cre-;WT, 3 mice ggt-cre+;WT, 3 mice ggt-cre+;Twist flox/flox and 3 ggt-cre+;Snail flox/flox
