TITLE
gene expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue after CLA intervention

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Iisomer-specific effects of conjugated linoleic (CLA) supplementation on gene expression with particular consideration of the PPAR 2 Pro12Ala SNP in human adipose tissue.

DESIGN
Effect of CLA supplementation on genome wide gene expression in adipose tissue biopsies from 5 PPARg2 Ala12Ala and 5 PPARg2 Pro12Pro men were investigated. Subjects underwent four intervention periods (4wk) in a randomized double blind cross-over design receiving f either cis-9, trans-11 CLA, trans-10,cis-12 CLA, 1:1 mixture of both isomers or a reference oil preparation. After each intervention biopsies were taken and whole genome expression microarrays were applied.
