TITLE
Cellular Origin and Pathophysiology of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cellular origin of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is debated. Transcriptome analysis of CLL and normal peripheral blood and splenic B cell subsets displayed highest similarity of CLL to mature CD5+ B cells. We identified a distinct CD5+CD27+ post-germinal center B cell subset, and revealed that immunoglobulin V gene mutated CLL are more similar to mutated CD5+ B cells, whereas unmutated CLL are more related to unmutated CD5+ B cells. Stereotyped immunoglobulin V gene rearrangements were significantly enriched among CD5+ B cells, providing further genetic evidence for a derivation of CLL from CD5+ B cells. Moreover, we identified deregulated expression patterns providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of CLL, including downregulation of EBF1 and KLF family members. Transcriptome profiling of CLL and healthy human blood and splenic mature B cell subsets. Identification of deregulated transcription patterns with implications on CLL pathobiology.

DESIGN
Human mature B cell subsets and CLL with mutated (mCLL) and unmutated V gene status (uCLL) were purified from peripheral blood and spleen. Samples of 5 to 7 donors each were collected and processed in three batches in a two rounded in vitro transcription protocol. Retrieved data were batch corrected and subjected to analysis. Human mature CD5+ B cell subsets and CLL with mutated (mCLL) and unmutated V gene status (uCLL) were purified from peripheral blood.
