TITLE
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue epigenomics using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays (HM 450K).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of reproducibility of Fresh Frozen (FF) derived DNA, FFPE derived DNA and FFPE derived DNA restored using the Infinium FFPE DNA Restoration solution (FFPEr) when used on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay.

DESIGN
9 normal colon samples and 11 breast tumour samples were analysed using 66 HM 450K analyses at varying DNA input amounts including technical duplicates and matched FF/FFPE/FFPEr biological duplicates. Reproducibility between technical and biological duplicates was assesed. Also, candidate gene discovery in FFPEr DNA was analysed by comparing methylation patterns between colon an breast samples and validating differentially methylated genes.
