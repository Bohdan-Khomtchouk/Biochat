TITLE
Knockdown of Hnrnpa0, a del(5q) Gene, Alters Myeloid Cell Fate in Murine Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of loss of Hnrnpa0, an RNA-binding protein shown to regulate transcript stability via binding to the AU-rich elements (AREs) of mRNAs, on myelopoiesis, we used RNAi interference to model Hnrnpa0 loss in an experimental murine cell system, and then used global expression profiling techniques to determine the impact of that knockdown on gene expression, especially ARE-containing genes. The PUER system is a murine myeloid progenitor cell line expressing the tamoxifen (4-OHT) responsive, PU.1-ER fusion gene, allowing controlled myeloid differentiation in cells in which Hnrnpa0 expression has been altered via RNAi technology. By examining perturbations in gene expression both before and during myeloid differentiation, we have shown the Hnrnpa0 loss preferentially alters ARE-containing genes, leading to a shift in myeloid specification away from the monocytic lineage.

DESIGN
Gene expression in the PUER cell line expressing the construct of interest, was measured before and 24 hours after 4-OHT induced differentiation. Three independent experiments using unique clones for the control vector and Hnrnpa0 shRNA vector were carried out in parallel.
