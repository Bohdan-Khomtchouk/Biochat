TITLE
The effect of 2-AA on P. aeruginosa PA14 and its mutants

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

SUMMARY
The pqs operon of the bacteria P. aeruginosa is responsible for the production of at least 60 secreted compounds mainly hidroxy-quinolones (HAQs). Some of them, like PQS and HHQ, were found to be important signal that control the virulence of the bacteria. We have discover that one of the most abandon molecule produced by the pqs operon, 2 aminoacetophenone (2-AA), a volatile molecule serves as a unique signal. In contrast to the previous described PQS and HHQ, 2-AA is downregulating virulence and acute phase proteins and upregulating chronic phase proteins. In addition we have found that 2-AA promotes the formation of persisters cells that antibiotic tolerant. we have compared the genes profile of wild-type PA14 strain and its derivatives topA which lacks Topoisomerase I and pqsA that do not produces HAQs or 2-AA to cultures that were treated with 3mM of 2-AA.

DESIGN
Cell were grown with and without 2-AA (3mM) to OD 2.0.
