TITLE
Caco-2 cells cultured in the presence of Lactobacillus fermentum strains AGR1485 or AGR1487

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Caco-2 cells co-cultured with L. fermentum AGR1487 (isolated from IBD patient), Caco-2 cells co-cultured with L. fermentum AGR1485 (isolated from healthy volunteer), or Caco-2 cells alone (Control).

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment with dye swap, A vs B, A vs C, B vs C, 8 biological replicates: A = Control, B = AGR1487, C = AGR1485

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
