TITLE
Molecular and functional characterization of FD-iPSC derived neural crest precursor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of FD-iPSC and deribved neural crest cells Here we report the derivation of patient specific Familial Dysautonomia-iPSCs and their directed differentiation into multiple cell types capable of modeling the tissue specific splicing defect in vitro.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated hESCs were exposed to control and drug treatments for 24 hours followed by mRNA expression analysis Global gene expression analysis of FD-iPSC and derived neural crest cells
