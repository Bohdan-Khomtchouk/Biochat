TITLE
U1 cells stimulated with the TLR8 agonist 3M-002 at 10 microM show a prominent activation of TLR-dependent genes as assessed by " Human toll-like Receptor PCR array pathway " over time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of the TLR8 agonist 3M-002 on latently HIV infected U1 cells. We found a prominent upregulation of TLR-dependent genes. Notably, the TLR8 agonist resulted in a marked activation of HIV.

DESIGN
We stimulated U1 cells for 6 or 10 hours with 3M-002 and subsequently harvested the cells, extracted total RNA. RNA was then used for quantifiying TLR-dependent gene upregulation using a commercial PCR array pathway
