TITLE
Identification of a biomarker panel for the intake of the common dietary trans fat elaidic acid (trans∆9-C18:1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Elaidic acid is an abundant industrial produced trans fatty acid in foodstuffs. Trans fatty acid intake has been correlated to an unfavorable plasma lipoprotein profile and an increased cardiovascular disease risk. The present study aimed to identify a plasma protein biomarker panel related to human intake of elaidic acid. The human liver cell line HepG2-SF was used as a model system, and the cells were maintained for seven days in serum-free medium containing 100 µM elaidic acid (trans∆9-C18:1), oleic acid (cis∆9-C18:1) or stearic acid (C18:0). The secretomes were analyzed by stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), difference in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and gene expression microarray analysis. Twelve proteins were found to be differentially regulated based on SILAC data ( > 1.3 fold change, P-value < 0.05), 13 proteins were found to be differentially regulated based on DIGE analysis ( > 1.3 fold change, P-value < 0.05), and 17 mRNA transcripts encoding extracellular proteins were determined to be affected ( > 1.3 fold change, P-value < 0.01) following the addition of elaidic acid compared to oleic acid or stearic acid.   The results revealed that 37 proteins were regulated specifically in response to elaidic acid exposure, and nine of these proteins were confirmed to be regulated in this manner by using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells kept used in serum free conditions. The cells were incubated for seven days in either 100 µM oleic, elaidic or stearic acid, before total RNA was extracted. For each group four biological replicates were made and from the each RNA extraction two technical replicates were made. There is a control group without fatty acid incubation.
