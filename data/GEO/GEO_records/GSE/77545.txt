TITLE
Expression data from small intestinal eosinophils and dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Under steady-state conditions, eosinophils are abundantly found in the small intestinal lamina propria, but their physiological function is largely unexplored. We performed a global gene expression analysis to examine which genes are highly expressed by small intestinal eosinophils (CD11b+CD11c(int)MHCII-SiglecF+) compared with dendritic cells (CD11c+MHCII+).

DESIGN
To examine the gene expression profiles of eosinophils and dendritic cells within the small intestinal lamina propria (LP), we isolated eosinophils (CD11b+CD11c(int)MHCII-SiglecF+) and dendritic cells (CD11c+MHCII+) from the small intestinal LP of 8 week-old C57BL/6 mice by FACS, then compared the gene expression profiles between these two populations by microarray analysis.
