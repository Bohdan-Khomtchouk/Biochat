Gene expression profiles of P7 bladder epithelium compartments isolated from Upk1b mice. (GUDMAP Series ID: 34)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing genitourinary tract The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here delineates the gene expression profiles of the epithelial compartments of the P7 mouse bladder.

DESIGN
At postnatal day 7 mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and the bladders were removed and cut at the bladder neck. The bladder was cut into rings and treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin in Tyrode's solution for 30 minutes at 37 °C. The layers were separated by gentle microdissection and the epithelial layer was further digested in a mixture of Blendzymes 1 & 4 at 37 °C until a single cell suspension was obtained.  The samples were placed in RLT and stored at -80 °C.RNA was prepared and the Epicentre 2-round amplification scheme described under the Lessard Group Protocols on the GUDMAP pages were performed. The Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array was used to interrogate the amplified RNA.
