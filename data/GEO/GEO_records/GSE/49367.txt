TITLE
Ginkgolic acids and Ginko biloba extract inhibit Escherichia coli O157:H7 biofilm formation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Contamination with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) is a worldwide problem but there is no effective therapy available for EHEC infection. Biofilm formation is closely related with EHEC infection and is one of the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Antibiofilm screening of 560 plant secondary metabolites against EHEC shows that ginkgolic acids C15:1 and C17:1 at 5 μg/ml and Ginko biloba extract at 100 μg/ml significantly inhibited EHEC biofilm formation on the surface of polystyrene, nylon membrane, and glass. Importantly, the working concentration of ginkgolic acids and G. biloba extract did not affect bacterial growth and has been known to be non-toxic to human. Transcriptional analyses showed that ginkgolic acid C15:1 repressed curli genes and prophage genes in EHEC, which were corroborated by reduced fimbriae production and biofilm reduction in EHEC. Interestingly, ginkgolic acids and G. biloba extract did not inhibit the biofilm formation of commensal E. coli K-12 strain. The current study suggests that plant secondary metabolites are important resource of biofilm inhibitors, as well as other bioactive compounds.
