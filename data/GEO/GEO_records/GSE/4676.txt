TITLE
Gene expression profiles of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Keywords: human tongue cancer, brachytherapy,  biopsy sample, primary tissues

DESIGN
For investigations of oral squamous cell carcinoma, pre-therapeutic biopsy sample tissues were taken from the patients suffering with tongue cancer. All the patients was treated by brachytherapy using 137Cs, 192Ir or 198Au source. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis-duplicate hybridization was carried out to total RNA of these samples.
