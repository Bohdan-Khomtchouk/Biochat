TITLE
Gene expression in third instar larval eye discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the absence of miR-998 expression.

DESIGN
Drosophila third instar larvae were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates for each genotype were prepared. The data was normalized using the RMA algorithm.
