TITLE
Microarray analysis of Adipose tissue of Short-term HFD-fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue inflammation is a key factor underlying insulin resistance in established obesity. Several models of immuno-compromised mice are protected from obesity-induced insulin resistance. However, it is unanswered whether inflammation triggers systemic insulin resistance or vice versa in obesity. The purpose of this study was to assess these questions.

DESIGN
8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice was treated with 60% HFD for 0 day (NCD), 3 days, and 7 days. Eipididymal fat was fractionated. Each groups have three replicates.
