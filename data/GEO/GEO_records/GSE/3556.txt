TITLE
Cag pathogenicity island-specific responses of gastric epithelial cells to Helicobacter pylori infection.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TC1: gastric epithelial (AGS) cells infected with wild type H. pylori (G27) and isogenic mutants in cagA and vacA for 0, 0.5, 3, 6, and 12 hours.  Total RNA was used to make single stranded Cy5 labelled probe and compared to Cy3 labelled probe from uninfected AGS cells. Hybridizations of G27 (trial 4) and cagA- (trial 3) timecourses were done in parallel.  A technical replicate of the G27 time course (trial 5) and hybridization of vacA- (trial 3) time course were done in parallel.  The cagA 6 and 12 hour time points were technically replicated (trial 4) (the cagA 6 hour sample of trial 3 was lost). TC2: Biological replication and expansion of TC1, using more isogenic mutants and timepoints.  AGS cells were mock infected, infected with G27, and isogenic mutants in cagN, cagA, cagE, and a deletion of the cag PAI for 0. 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.  Probe synthesis and hybridization was done as in TC1. Note: there may have been a sample mix-up with PAI 12, swapping it with G27 or cagN 12.
