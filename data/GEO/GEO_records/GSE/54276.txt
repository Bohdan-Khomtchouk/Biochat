TITLE
Transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in response to 4 weeks of exercise training

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Consequence of physical exercise in skeletal muscle was investigated in C57BL/6 mice after 4 weeks of exercise training and compared to sedentary controls.

DESIGN
Exercised mice received four 4 weeks of regular exercise training on a motorized treadmill and were compared to sedentary controls.  6 mice of each Treatment were used to extract RNA from the quadriceps muscle three hours after the last training bout
