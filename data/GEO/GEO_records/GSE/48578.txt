TITLE
Alteration of gene expression in human T cells treated with JPH203

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To indentify the effect of JPH203 on the gene expression in activated T cells, microarray analysis was performed using activated human T cells derived from peripheral blood.  Human CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood in healthy volunteer  were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of 1uM JPH203 for 3days. RNA was extracted and gene expression was compared between JPH203-treated cells and control cells.

DESIGN
Gene epression of human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells  activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of 1uM JPH203 for 3days was measured.
