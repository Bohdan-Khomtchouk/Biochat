TITLE
Gene expression-based, individualized outcome prediction for autism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of 91 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated miRNAs in 5 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases and 5 controls.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a well-defined cohort of 5 autism spectrum disorder cases and 5 controls was used to acquire expression profiles of 91 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated miRNAs, leading to the first global miRNA expression profile of ASD in China.
