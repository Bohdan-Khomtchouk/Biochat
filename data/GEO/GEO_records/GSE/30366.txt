TITLE
Digital transcriptome analysis of genes on sex chromosomes in papaya (Carica papaya)

ORGANISM
Carica papaya

SUMMARY
For identifying genes for sex determination in papaya, digital gene expression analysis by Ht-SuperSAGE (Matsumura et al., 2010) was carried out in flowers from male, female and hermaphrodite plants of papaya.  Total more than 9,273,744 26bp-tags were obtained by sequence analysis using SOLiD3 and mapped on papaya primitive sex chromosome sequences.

DESIGN
6 samples examined: male young flowerbud, male mature flower bud, female young flower bud, female mature flower bud, hermaphrodite young flower bud, hermaphrodite mature flower bud
