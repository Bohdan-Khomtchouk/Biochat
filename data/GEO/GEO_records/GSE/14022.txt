TITLE
Mapping Novel Chromatin Regions Using Sono-Seq

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
We found that sonication of crosslinked chromatin produces breaks at non-random sites in DNA and can be used to map sites of high chromatin accessibility when combined with high-throughput tag sequencing using the GA II platform from Illumina. This technique, which we named Sono-Seq, can be a simple and broadly applicable method for mapping many open chromatin sites.  Furthermore, these results give insights into reference sample types, such as Input DNA, normal IgG ChIP DNA, MNase-digested DNA, and naked DNA, that have been used in ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq experiments.
