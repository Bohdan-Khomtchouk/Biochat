TITLE
Combination scaffolds of salmon fibrin, hyaluronic acid, and laminin for human neural stem cell tissue engineering

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A goal of this project is to evaluate the integrin mRNA expression in human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPC) using high-throughput sequencing technologies. We found high levels of mRNA expression for the  β1, α7, α3, α6, β5, αV, α5, and α9 integrins. This suggests that hNSPCs may express integrin receptors that can bind fibrinogen and laminin proteins.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of hNSPCs from three different passages (12, 15, and 17) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
