TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA from the colon of WT, Nod2-/-, Pglyrp3-/-, and Pglyrp3-/-Nod2-/- mice treated with oral DSS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type (WT), Nod2-/-, Pglyrp3-/-, and Pglyrp3-/-Nod2-/- mice (BALB/c) were treated with oral 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 48, 72, or 96 hrs, their colons were removed and homogenized, and RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL method. Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the amounts of mRNA in the colon using the inflammatory gene expression RT2 Profiler PCR Array from Qiagen/SA Biosciences.

DESIGN
qRT-PCR gene expression profiling

PLATFORM
GPL17228 Qiagen/SA Biosciences Mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptors gene expression array panel (PAMM-011A)
