TITLE
microRNAs profiling in hippocampal cells of mouse with Sound-induced Seizure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After an electrically induced seizure, mice (NMRI) received electrical stimulation (current intensity 44 mA, 0.2 ms monopolar pulses at 6 Hz frequency for 3 s). RNA was extracted from the hippocampi at 0, 3, 6, 24 and 72 h after the seizure. microRNA expressions were measured via microarray technology using Exiqon's miCURYâ„¢ LNA Arrays.

DESIGN
Time-course design, treated cells at 0, 3, 6, 24, and 72 h, with 7 replicate each

PLATFORM
GPL11432 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 5th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
