TITLE
Profiling of zinc altered gene expression in human prostate normal (HPR-1) and malignant (PC-3) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain a better understanding of the zinc effect on prostate cells, gene expression profiling analyses were conducted using HPR-1 and PC-3 cells treated with or without zinc (1,500 ng/ml) after 24 hrs serum-depletion.  Zinc effect on gene expression was evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 hrs of zinc treatment compared to the control, using human genome survey microarray chips. A total of 6,110 identified genes exhibited three expression patterns in response to zinc a threshold of Â±2.5 folds: suppressed (3,534 in PC-3; 1,953 in HPR-1), increased (571 in PC-3; 872 in HPR-1), and otherwise altered (16 in PC-3; 13 in HPR-1). Keywords: Zinc effect, time course, cell type comparison
