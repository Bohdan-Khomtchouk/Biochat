TITLE
Low dose human chorionic gonadotropin hCG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Influence of ovarian stimulation with 200 IU of hCG, (administered in the late follicular phase among ICSI patients undergoing a GnRH-antagonist protocol), on the endometrium on the day of oocyte pick-up. The purpose of the present study is to assess the influence of the administration of low dose hCG on the endometrium.  In addition, by analysing the correlation of the morphological pattern and gene expression profile of human endometrium on the day of oocyte retrieval in patients of both treatment groups, we want to study the implantation potential. Keywords: gene expression analysis

DESIGN
In total 10 samples from patients without pregnancy following embryo transfer were analyzed for gene expression analysis with microarrays, 5 patients from group A (rFSH group) and 5 patients from group B (hCG group) were compared
