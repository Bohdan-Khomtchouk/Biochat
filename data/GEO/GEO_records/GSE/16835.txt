TITLE
Regulatory T-cell comittment is ensured by inhibition of the global gene regulator SATB1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Treg) are potent inhibitors of the activation of the immune system. Within these experiments we characterize the transcriptional profile of expanded Treg cells subjected to CD3CD28 short-time activation and subpopulations of CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated CD4+ T cell subpopulations were compared to CD4+ T cells separated into CD25 negative and positive subpopulations activated under various conditions.
