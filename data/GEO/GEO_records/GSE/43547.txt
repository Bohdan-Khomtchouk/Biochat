TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of hypothalamic gene expression in prenatally undernourished male rat offspring under high fat diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Based on the developmental origin of health of disease hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal 70% maternal food restriction (FR30) predisposes the offspring to development of pathologies in adulthood. In the present study, we focused on the hypothalamus gene expression profile of standard and high fat (HF)-fed FR30 adult offspring.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated hypothalami of control standard and high fat-fed adult offspring compared to prenatally undernourished (FR30) counterparts.
