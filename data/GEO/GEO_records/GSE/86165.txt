TITLE
GRO-seq from HCT116, MCF7 and SJSA cell lines treated with DMSO and Nutlin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify loci with transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase, we performed GRO-seq analysis of colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, breast carcinoma line MCF7, and osteosarcoma line SJSA treated with MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin.

DESIGN
HCT116, MCF7, and SJSA cells were subjected to a run-on experiment after 1 hour of treatment with either DMSO or 10 microM Nutlin.

PLATFORM
