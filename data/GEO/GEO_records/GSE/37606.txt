TITLE
Gene expression profiling of endothelial cells isolated from wildtype and Crim1KST264/KST264 adult mice kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous analysis has shown that the Crim1KST264/KST264 mice develop progressive renal fibrosis as well as vascular abnormalities characterised by increased vascular leakiness and loss of endothelium integrity. To further define this endothelium abnormality, CD31+ endothelial cells were MACS sorted from both wildtype and Crim1KST264/KST264 kidneys for expression profiling to determine the biological processes that are perturbed.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from CD31+ MACS sorted endothelial cells from 4 pairs of mixed gender wildtype and Crim1KST264/KST264 adult mice kidneys
