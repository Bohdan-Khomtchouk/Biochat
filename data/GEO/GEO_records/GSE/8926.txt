TITLE
Global expression profiling to study the effect of triazolopyrimidine herbicide treatment on Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarray (Affymetrix ATH1) we studied the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to triazolopyrimidine (FirstRate) herbicde that inhibits acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme and thus disrupts branched chain amino acid biosynthesis. A number of genes related to amino acid, protein metabolism, growth, regulatory networks, respiratory pathways, stress, defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Keywords: Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicide stress response

DESIGN
Surfactant (preference 0.25%) treated plants were used as carrier control group and EC50 concentration of triazolopyrimidine was used as the herbicide treatment group. Each of the control and treatment group consisted of 3 biological replicates and each biological replicates comprised leaves from 10 individual plants. RNA was extracted at 24h post treatment to study the transcriptional alterations caused by the herbicide treatment.
