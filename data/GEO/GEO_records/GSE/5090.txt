TITLE
PCOS patients vs control subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to study if there are differences in gene expression in the adipose tissue of women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to non-hyperandrogenic women. PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. This disease is frequently associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and defects in insulin secretion, predisposing these women to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. We have applied high-density oligonucleotide arrays to omental adipose tissue samples obtained from eight morbidly obese PCOS patients and seven morbidly obese non-PCOS women at the time of bariatric surgery. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
We have compared the omental adipose tissue of eight PCOS patients with the same tissue in seven control women without PCOS. All of them are morbidly obese subjects. We also have included two replicates, one biological and one technical.
