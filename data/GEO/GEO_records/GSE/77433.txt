SUMMARY
Inhibition of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in leflunomide (LEF)-mediated cytotoxic effects on renal carcinoma cells

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 4 samples [2 control groups (Caki-2 treated with 0.1%DMSO for 48h) and 2 experimental groups (Caki-2 treated with 200μM leflunomide for 48h)], were used to acquire expression profiles of 115 up-regulated and 176 down-regulated mRNA
