TITLE
Transcript expression data from  Populus euphratica leaves subjected to drought

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Populus euphratica is a natural population grown in semirid areas. The molecular response of the poplar to drought maintain to be elucided, especially at global genome level. We used Affymetrix poplar genome genechip microarrays to analyze the full transcript expression underlying different drought intensities and identified significantly differently expressed genes during this process.
