TITLE
Transcript expression data from  Populus euphratica leaves subjected to drought

ORGANISM
Populus euphratica

SUMMARY
Populus euphratica is a natural population grown in semirid areas. The molecular response of the poplar to drought maintain to be elucided, especially at global genome level. We used Affymetrix poplar genome genechip microarrays to analyze the full transcript expression underlying different drought intensities and identified significantly differently expressed genes during this process.

DESIGN
Uniformly developed seedlings of P. euphratica grown in gradually long-term drought throught water-withholding treatment. Affymetrix poplar genechip was hired to investigate the full transcripts changed of the poplar response to different drought intensity levels.
