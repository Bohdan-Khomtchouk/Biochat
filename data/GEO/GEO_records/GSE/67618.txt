TITLE
Map the causative gene of hearing loss in Chinese Rongchang pigs by GWAS

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Whole genome genotyping (WGG) arrays are the powerful tools for GWAS in farm animal. Here we take advantage of the commercial Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChips, a mapping population including 101 individuals were genotyped. Association analysis and linkage analysis were followed to map the causative gene of hearing loss in Chinese Rongchang pigs.

DESIGN
To map the causative gene of hearing loss in Chinese Rongchang pigs, we genotyped 60000 markers in the genome of a mapping population including 101 individuals. Illumina 60K BeadChips were used. Sample types were normal blood samples.

PLATFORM
GPL11379 Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (WG-410)
