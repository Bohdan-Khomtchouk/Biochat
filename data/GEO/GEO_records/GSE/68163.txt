TITLE
Gene predictors of response to bendamustine in CLL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bendamustine is a commonly-used drug to treat CLL patients. Because drug-responses among the patients are heterogeneous, we wanted to find candidate genes to predict sensitivity to the compound We used microarrays to find genes whose expression correlates with the in vitro induced-cytotoxcity by a 24-hour incubation with bendamustine 25 Âµm

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from CD19+ tumoral cells from 38 PBMCs of CLL cases
