TITLE
Drosophila elevated CO2 (hypercapnia) microarray

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effects of elevated CO2 (hypercapnia) on organisms are not well known, nor are the molecular pathways by which organisms sense CO2. We have performed microarray analysis on Drosophila in order to develop a genetic model for better understanding the effects of CO2.

DESIGN
Equal numbers of 5-day old male and female flies (at least 40 total) were exposed to 13% CO2 or air for 24h and RNA extracted. Gene expression changes in CO2 compared with air were analyzed. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the 3 separate microarray experiments are included.
