TITLE
GRX5, PET117 and MLP1 yeast mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparisons between grx5, pet117 and mlp1 mutants. All of them are referenced to the same parental wild type sample using three independent samples and three independent nylon macroarrays. Each replicate pair (wt/mutant), hybridized on the same membrane, was normalized by lowess method. z-tests were performed to evaluate differential gene expression.
