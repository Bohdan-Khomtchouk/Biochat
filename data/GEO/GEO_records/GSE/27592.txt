TITLE
Gene expression in F9 teratocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Esko's laboratory focuses on the structure, function, and biosynthesis of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. This laboratory also works on the design and synthesis of small molecule inhibitors of glycosylation. Gene expression in F9 teratocarcinoma cells: Study of the differential expression of glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases and proteoglycan core proteins in F9 teratocarcinoma cells before and after differentiation with retinoic acid/theophylline/cAMP. Published data indicated that differentiation of the cells induces the synthesis of anticoagulant heparin-like compounds and a large increase in overall glycosaminoglycan synthesis.

DESIGN
Glyco-gene Chip microarray analysis of RNA samples (in triplicate) from the cells before and after differentiation to reveal factors that regulate the assembly process and how it leads to the generation of binding sites for glycan-binding proteins.

PLATFORM
GPL11093 [scrGLYCO-v1F] Custom Affymetrix Glyco v1 GeneChip
