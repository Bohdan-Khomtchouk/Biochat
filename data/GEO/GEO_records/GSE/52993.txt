TITLE
Microarray analysis to detect whether the genome-wide gene expression profile of fibroblast-induced neurons resembles primary neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore more details in the similarities and differences between ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 iN cells and primary neurons, we compared the global gene expression pattern of matured iN cells 12 days post infection with mouse primary neurons and MEFs by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a total of 26423 unique genes were detected in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, induced neurons from MEFs by Ascl1+Brn2+Ngn2+Rarg+Nr5a2 at 12 days after infection and primary neurons from postnatal day 0 hippocampus, leading to more details about the similarities and differences among the three groups.
