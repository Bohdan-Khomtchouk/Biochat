DNA copy number analysis of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma, and morphologically similar lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA copy number analysis of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcomas, and related lesions, using 32k BAC array CGH. All four cases analyzed with array CGH showed amplification of the region 86.30-87.74 Mb in 3p11.1-12.1. No additional aberration was detected in more than two tumors, except for the deletion distal to the amplification on chromosome 3. Case 1 showed deletion affecting the region from the centromere of chromosome 1 to the 5'-end of TGFBR3. Homozygous deletion was found in one case (case 6) affecting the region 21.08-22.15 Mb on chromosome arm 9p harboring the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes.
