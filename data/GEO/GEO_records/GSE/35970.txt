TITLE
Growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) regulates cell-fate decision of the bipotential granulocytic-monocytic precursor defined by the expression of CD48 as a new marker

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using bone marrow cells of GFP:Gfi1 knock in mice, we separated Gfi1-high and Gfi1-low expressing cells in the classical CD11b+, GR1-low monocytic cell fraction. We sorted CD11b+, GR1-low GFP:Gfi1-high and low cells as well as CD11b+, GR1-high granulocytes and CD11b-high, GR1-intermediate cells from Gfi1-knock-out mice for further analysis. We used Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays (GPL8321)

DESIGN
The study should determine how Gfi1 regulates the cell fate of monocytes/granulocytes in mice
