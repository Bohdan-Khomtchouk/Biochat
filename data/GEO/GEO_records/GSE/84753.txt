TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of regulatory gene expression profiles by NF-YCs, and RGL2 under paclobutrazol (PAC) condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand how the NF-YC-RGL2 complex functions in repressing seed germination, a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis was carried out using germinating seeds of rgl2, nf-ycT and the wild-type (Col) grown on the medium containing 5 ÂµM PAC and Col grown on mock treatment. Basing on the criteria of 1.5-fold cutoff for the genes with 5% false discovery rate, we first identified the differentially expressed genes in Col_PAC vs Col_mock, nf-ycT_PAC vs Col_PAC, and rgl2_PAC vs Col_PAC subsets, which are referred to as PAC-, NF-YC-, and RGL2-regulated genes.These data reveal that NF-YCs and RGL2 co-target a set of common genes in response to phytohormone signals, strongly supporting the role of NF-YC-RGL2 in seed germination regulation.

DESIGN
Digital gene expression tag profiles of wild type (Col), nf-ycT mutant, and rgl2 mutant germinating seed for 12 h after stratification were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
