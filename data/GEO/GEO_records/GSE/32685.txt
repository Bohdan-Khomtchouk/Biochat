TITLE
ZNF750 Drives Terminal Epidermal Differentiation via Induction of Klf4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disrupted differentiation is a hallmark of numerous diseases, which in epidermis alone impact > 25% of the population. In a search for dominant mediators of differentiation, we defined a requirement for the ZNF750 nuclear protein in terminal epidermal differentiation. ZNF750 controlled genes mutated in numerous human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, LCE3B, ALOXE3, and SPINK5. ZNF750 potently induced progenitor differentiation via an evolutionarily conserved C2H2 zinc finger motif. The epidermal master regulator, p63, bound the ZNF750 promoter and was necessary for its induction. ZNF750 restored differentiation to p63-deficient tissue, suggesting it acts downstream of p63. A search for functionally important ZNF750 targets via analysis of ZNF750-regulated genes identified KLF4, a transcription factor that activates late epidermal differentiation genes. ZNF750 binds the Klf4 promoter and controls its expression. ZNF750 thus provides a direct link between a tissue-specifying factor, p63, and an effector of terminal differentiation, Klf4, and represents a potential future target for disorders of this process.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To establish a differentiation signature for primary human keratinocytes, with ZNF750-depleted, and Klf4-depleted, total RNA was isolated in biologic duplicate from cells in different conditions and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus arrays.
