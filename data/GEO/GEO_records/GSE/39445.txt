TITLE
Effect of sleep restriction on the human transcriptome during extended wakefulness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a cross balanced design human subjects were given one week of sufficient sleep and insufficient sleep (6 h per day). Following each of these conditions they were then kept awake for a day, a night and the subsequent day. During each of these periods of extended wakefulness 10 blood samples were taken, RNA was extracted from leukocytes, labelled and hybridised to human whole-genome microarrays

DESIGN
A total of 438 samples comprising 26 human subjects, for which 20 samples across multiple time-points/sleep condition were collected.
