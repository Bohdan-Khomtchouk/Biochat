evolution of genotypes and differences - affy_gnp07_regeneome_cotton

ORGANISM
Gossypium

SUMMARY
affy_gnp07_regeneome_cotton - evolution of genotypes and differences  - Genes involved in somatic embryogenesis

DESIGN
24 arrays - Cotton; genotype and ecotype comparison,time course The samples are from the following varieties of Gossypium hirsutum (wild type): - Irma  from variety NEmb - 1a and B2 are two independent batch of seeds from the variety Coker310. They were selected for their ability to perform embryogenesis. Irma does not embryogenesis after the formation of callus. 1a and b2 have respectively a low and a high capacity for embryogenesis.
