TITLE
Gene expression in mouse white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trans-10, Cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes fat loss in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT). The early transcriptome changes in WAT were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to t10c12 CLA.  Their gene expression responses between 4 to 24 hr after treatment showed a common set of early gene expression changes indicative of an integrated stress response (ISR). Keywords: control/treatment time course

DESIGN
Mouse WAT RNA for each time point was isolated from two control and two treatment samples for analysis on four microarrays.  The two control and two treatment samples consisted of RP tissues from 5 pooled mice for each sample, requiring a total of twenty mice for the four samples taken at each time point.
