TITLE
Gene expression in mouse white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trans-10, Cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes fat loss in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT). The early transcriptome changes in WAT were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to t10c12 CLA.  Their gene expression responses between 4 to 24 hr after treatment showed a common set of early gene expression changes indicative of an integrated stress response (ISR). Keywords: control/treatment time course
