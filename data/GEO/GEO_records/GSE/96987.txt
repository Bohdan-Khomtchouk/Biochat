TITLE
AmpliSeq analysis of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes unstimulated or stimulated with endothelin-1 in the presence of either vehicle (DMSO), Ivermectin, Importazole, IPA-3, or verapamil. Results provide insight into the pathways regulated by the treatments.

DESIGN
AmpliSeq of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes untreated or treated with endothelin-1 in the presence of either vehicle (DMSO), Ivermectin, Importazole, IPA-3, or verapamil for 18 hours, in quadruplicate, using Ion Proton System.

PLATFORM
