TITLE
Differential methylation in CN-AML preferentially targets non-CGI regions and is dictated by DNMT3A mutational status and associated with predominant hypomethylation of HOX genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study investigated the abberrent DNA methylation in correlation with gene expression in cytogenetic normal acute myeloid leukemia. CN-AML blasts isolated from patient bone marrow aspriation were compared to CD34+ cell population from healthy donors by DNA methylation array and affymetrix gene expression microarray.

DESIGN
Bisulfited genomic DNA from patients and normal materials were hybirdized to Illumia Infinium Human Methylation 450K Beadchip. Gene expression profiling on selected patient cohort are publish aviable.
