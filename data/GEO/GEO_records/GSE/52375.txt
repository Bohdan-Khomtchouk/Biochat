TITLE
Expression analysis of Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 delta-CCNA_00382 (ccrM) [DccrM] vs Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 wild type [WT]

ORGANISM
Caulobacter crescentus NA1000

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a  Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 delta-CCNA_00382 (ccrM) mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into this strain render it incapable of methylating its genome on the adenine at GANTC motifs.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 and three separate cultures of a triple mutant strain, Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 delta-CCNA_00382 (ccrM), in which the ccrM gene coding for a DNA methyltransferase methylating the adenine in GANTC motifs is truncated and its product inactive.  Each chip measures the expression level of 3933 genes from Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 with 3 probes per gene and with three-fold technical redundancy.
