TITLE
A host type I interferon response is induced by cytosolic sensing of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The innate immune system responds to unique molecular signatures that are widely conserved among microbes but that are not normally present in host cells.  Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics.The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di-guanosine  monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical  regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In  vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent  immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. Here we provide  evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel  immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by cyclic-di-  GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids  induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated  genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, NF-!B and MAP kinases. However, the  cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic  acid-sensing pathways.Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can  induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: macrophages transfected with mono-GMP (negative control), double-stranded DNA (positive control), or cyclic-di-GMP (experimental condition).  Biological replicates: two, independently treated, harvested, and hybridized to arrays.  One replicate per array, except two technical replicates were performed for one of the positive control samples.
