TITLE
Effect of posttranslational modifications of SATB1 on its ability to regulate global gene expression in HeLa Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene profiling studies using RNA from HeLa cells overexpressing point mutants of SATB1 defective in phosphorylation or acetylation unequivocally demonstrated the importance of these modifications towards the ability of SATB1 to act as a global regulator of gene expression. HeLa cells were chosen as a representative of non-T cells, and do not express SATB1 endogenously. Keywords: cDNA array

DESIGN
Total RNA from untransfected HeLa cells was used as reference and was labeled with Cy5. Total RNA from HeLa cells stably transfected with wild type, or S185A, or K136A mutant SATB1 expressing construct was used as experimental sample and was labeled with Cy3.
