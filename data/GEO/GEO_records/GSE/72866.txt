TITLE
LncRNA expression profiles of LNCaP cells treated with 10 nM DHT for 0 and 2 hr.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed human lncRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify differential expression lncRNAs between DHT treated LNCaP cells and untreated cells.

DESIGN
Androgen induced lncRNA expression in LNCaP, human prostate cancer cell, was measured at 0 and 2 hours after exposure to 10 nM DHT.
