TITLE
Internal validation cohort of breast cancers for development of ClinicoMolecular Triad Classification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our early study (PMID: 21939527), we have created a ClinicoMolecular Triad Classification (CMTC) to improve prediction and prognostication of breast cancer by using a training cohort contained 161 breast cancer patients (2003 to 2008). Here, a supplemental internal validation cohort contained 340 breast cancer patients was collected (2008 to 2010) for development of the CMTC.

DESIGN
Total 340 fine-needle aspirates (FNA) specimens from breast tumors without replicate were collected and prepared for microarray examination. Finally, 284 invasive breast cancers were used in this study. The training dataset of 161 breast tumors can be found at GEO Accession: GSE16987.
