TITLE
Effects of benfotiamine in cultured human myotubes exposed to both normal and high glucose cencentrations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the present work was to study the effects of benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate) upon glucose and lipid metabolism and gene expression in differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) incubated for 4 days under normal (5.5 mM glucose) and hyperglycemic (20 mM glucose) conditions. Myotubes established from lean, healthy volunteers were treated with benfotiamine for 4 days. Glucose and lipid metabolism were studied with labeled precursors. Gene expression was measured using real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and microarray technology.
