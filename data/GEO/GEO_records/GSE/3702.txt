TITLE
Early gene expression responses to a Salmonella infection in the chicken intestine

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
1-day old chickens were orally inoculated with 1e5 c.f.u. Salmonella enteritidis. 24 hours after infection RNA from the jejunum was analysed. Two different microarray platforms were used, a homemade cDNA microarray and the Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome Array Keywords: host response; genetic background

DESIGN
There were 4 groups, 5 animals each. The microarray hybridisations were performed with pooled RNA samples. 4 comparisions were done: -control fast growing chicken line vs. salmonella fast growing chicken line -control slow growing chicken line vs. salmonella slow growing chicken line -control fast growing chicken line vs. control slow growing chicken line -salmonella fast growing chicken line vs. salmonella slow growing chicken line

PLATFORM
GPL2719 intestine-spleen combined array GPL3213 [Chicken] Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array
