TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and Rybp-deficient ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate a global change in gene expression by conditional depletion of Rybp in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from wild-type and Rybp-deficient ES cells, and were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays
