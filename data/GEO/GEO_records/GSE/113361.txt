TITLE
Bivalent chromatin domains in glioblastoma multiforme reveal an epigenetic signature of early neural development mediated by SHH and Wnt signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 to identify bivalent chromatin regions in T98G Glioblastoma multiforme cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and Input in T98G cells.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
