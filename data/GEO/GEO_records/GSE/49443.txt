TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids of PWD and B6 male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MiRNA expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes (LP), pachytene spermatocytes (RP) and spermatids (ST) from PWD and B6 was performed to study the genome wide variation in miRNA expression between two mouse subspecies.

DESIGN
Populations of pre-pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids were isolated from PWD and B6 mice. All populations were isolated in triplicates from two bilogical replicas Hence, RNA was prepared from 18 samples and was then subject to labeling and hybridization on microarray chips.
