TITLE
Gene expression in mouse retinas with cone cyclic nucleotide gated channel deficiencies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel is essential for central and color vision and visual acuity.  Mutations in the channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophy.  We investigated the gene expression profiles in mouse retina with CNG channel deficiency on a cone-dominant background, i.e., CNGA3-/-/Nrl-/- and CNGB3-/-/Nrl-/- mice, relative to Nrl-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 2 retinas per animal (CNGA3-/-/Nrl-/-, CNGB3-/-/Nrl-/-, and Nrl-/- mice). The background strain for these mutations was C57bl/6.
