TITLE
miRNA expression of canine mammary cancer stem cells

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The aim of our study was to assess miRNA expression of canine mammary cancer stem cells.  Three canine mammary cancer cell lines (CMT-U27, CMT-U309 and P114) were stained using  Anti-Sca1 (Stem cell antigen 1) antibodies. The FACS analysis showed 0,3-1% of Sca1+ cells in  each of the cell line. The cells were sorted (using FACS Aria II) as Sca1+ and Sca1- and subjected  to further analysis of miRNA expression (using Agilent custom miRNA microarray).

DESIGN
Canine mammary cancer cell lines were stained using Stem Cell Antigen 1 antibodies and then sorted using FACS Aria II as Sca-1 positive (cancer stem cells) and Sca-1 negative (control). Then, total RNA was isolated and hybridized at miRNA microarrays.
