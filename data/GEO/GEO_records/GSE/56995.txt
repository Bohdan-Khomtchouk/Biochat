TITLE
Snf1 is involved in the aberrant cell cycle induction in cdc14-3 mutant upon NaCl stress in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of cdc14-3 and cdc14-3_snf1 mutants at non-permissive temp (35C) for 90min or 2hr followed by 30min NaCl stress. The experiment showed the aberrant cell cycle induction in cdc14-3 mutants upon NaCl response is abrogated with snf1 deletion in cdc14-3 background.

DESIGN
Two-color fluorescence arrays reporting on mRNA abundance in strains before and at 30 min after a shock with 0.7M NaCl

PLATFORM
GPL15778 NimbleGen UW-Madison Saccharomyces cerevisiae 380K tiling array [2006-10-12_Ansari_tiling_51mer; gene-level version]
