TITLE
Genome-Wide Gli3 Binding Sites in the E11.5 Mouse Limb Bud

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals via Gli transcription factors to direct digit number and identity in the vertebrate limb. We have characterized the Gli-dependent cis-regulatory network through a combination of whole genome ChIP-on-chip and transcriptional profiling of the developing mouse limb. These analyses identified approximately 5,000 high quality Gli3 binding sites, including all known Gli-dependent enhancers. Discrete binding regions exhibit a higher-order clustering, highlighting the complexity of cis-regulatory interactions. Further, Gli3 binds inertly to previously identified neural-specific Gli enhancers, demonstrating the accessibility of their cis-regulatory elements. Intersection of DNA binding data with gene expression profiles predicted 205 putative limb target genes. The supplementary bed file contains all 5,274 high quality binding Gli3 binding sites reported in the paper.
