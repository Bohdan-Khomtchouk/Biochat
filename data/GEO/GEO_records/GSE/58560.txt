TITLE
TWIST1-induced microRNA-424 drives an intermediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that opposes metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a TWIST1-inducible epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model in HMLE cells, miRNA changes were profiled at different time points during an active EMT.

DESIGN
This experiment includes a total of 12 samples consisting of 2 experimental groups at 2 matching time points (day 4, day 12), each with 3 biological repeats: 3 control empty vector samples as controls and 3 inducible TWIST1 samples as the experimental condition.
