TITLE
Sperm miRNA expression differences between bulls consuming toxic and non-toxic tall fescue seed

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objectives of our study were to identify microRNA (miRNA) present in bovine sperm and to evaluate the effects of fescue toxicosis on sperm miRNA expression.

DESIGN
Angus bulls were assigned to treatments of either toxic or non-toxic fescue seed diets. Semen was collected and subjected to microRNA (miRNA) isolation after 126 days. Three bull's sperm miRNA samples from each treatment group were chosen and pooled for deep sequencing. Sequencing results were used to create a custom microarray for miRNA comparison between groups. LC Sciences was used as a service provider for the sequencing and custom microarray.
