TITLE
Gene expression profiling of high (HAB) vs. low (LAB) and normal (NAB) anxiety-related behavior mice in five laser microdissected brain regions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigating the molecular basis and correlates of anxiety-related and depression-like behaviors, we generated a mouse model consisting of high (HAB), normal (NAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mice. We utilized the elevated plus-maze for testing the genetic predisposition to anxiety-related behavior and, consequently, used this as selection criterion for the inbreeding of our animals. In depression-related tests, HAB mice display a more passive, depression-like coping strategy than LAB mice, resembling clinical comorbidity of anxiety and depression as observed in psychiatric patients. Using a microarray approach, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the basolateral (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA), the cingulate cortex (Cg) and the dentate gyrus (DG) – centers of the central nervous anxiety and fear circuitries – were investigated and screened for differences between HAB, NAB and LAB mice.

DESIGN
Analysis was performed from four to six animals per line (HAB, NAB and LAB from generation 25, respectively) per brain region, giving a total of 78 individual arrays analyzed. The LAB mouse line is referred to as reference.
