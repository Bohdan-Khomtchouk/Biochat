TITLE
Cytoplasmic mRNA level upon 4.5SH KD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that Myodonta-clade-specific 4.5S RNAH (4.5SH), an abundant nuclear noncoding RNA that is highly homologous to the retrotransposon SINE B1, controls the expression of multiple genes containing the antisense insertion of SINE B1 The depletion of endogenous 4.5SH with antisense oligonucleotides changes the subcellular distribution of these target transcripts containing the antisense SINE B1 insertions.

DESIGN
To identify individual 4.5SH target asB1 genes, we performed a microarray analysis using cytoplasmic RNAs derived from control or 4.5SH-depeleted cells.
