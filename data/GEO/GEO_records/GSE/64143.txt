TITLE
Expression data from prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B (enzalutamide sensitive) and  C4-2B-MDVR (enzalutamide resistant) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer C4-2B cells were cultured in enzalutamide in a dose-escalation manner. After sixty passages cells were resistant to enzalutamide, with a specific sets of genes been deregulated. We performed global gene expression analysis by cDNA microarrays to identify genes responsible for enzalutamide resistance in C4-2B-MDVR cells.

DESIGN
Enzalutamide resistant C4-2B-MDVR cells were selected from C4-2B cells during long time enzalutamide treatment. Genes responsible for enzalutamide resistance were identified using C4-2B vs. C4-2B-MDVR RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
