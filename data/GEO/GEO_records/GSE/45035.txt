TITLE
Brain transcriptome profiles in mouse model simulating features of post-traumatic stress disorder

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Social stress mouse models were used to simulate human post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  C57B/6 mice exposed to SJL aggressor mice exhibited behaviors accepted as PTSD-in-mouse phenotype: 'frozen' motion, aggressor’s barrier avoidance, startled jumping, and retarded locomotion.  Transcripts in hippocampus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum (nucleus acumbens), septal region, corpus striatum, hemi-brain, blood, spleen and heart of stressed and control C57B/6 mice were analyzed using Agilent’s mouse genome-wide arrays.

DESIGN
C57B6 mice were exposed to SJL aggressor mice for periods of 5 days and 10days (6 hours each day) to induce anxiety/stress which parallels to PTSD in human Organs, blood and brain regions were collected after 24 hours and 1.5 week of post 5 days social defeat period; and 24 hour and 6 weeks post 10 days social stress period.
