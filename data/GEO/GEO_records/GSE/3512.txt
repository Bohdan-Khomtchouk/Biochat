TITLE
Fat-type specific effects of high fat diets

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
High fat diet (HF) rodent models have contributed significantly to the dissection of the pathophysiology of the insulin resistance syndrome, but their phenotype varies distinctly between different studies. Here, we have analyzed gene expression patterns in livers of animals fed with different HF with varying fatty acid compositions. Keywords: diet-gene interaction
