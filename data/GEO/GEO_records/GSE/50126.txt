TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Runx3 bound regions in splenic NK cells activated in vivo with IL-15

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was conducted using freshly isolated splenic WT NK cells from IL-15/Ra treated mice with anti-Runx3 antibody (Ab) and non-immune serum (NIS) as control.

DESIGN
Runx3 and NIS IP from splenic NK cells of IL-15/Ra treated WT mice, isolated by negative selection using NK cell isolation kit (R & D) followed by sorting of NKp46+ cells.

PLATFORM
