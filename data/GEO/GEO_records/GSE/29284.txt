TITLE
Expression data from newborn mouse brain expressing a constitutively active PDGFRb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify targets of PDGFRb signaling and potentially new markers for pericyte activation, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression in control and mutant pericytes expressing a constitutively active PDGFRb. We chose 1 day after birth as a time point for analysis because the number of pericytes and morphology of the vasculature is similar between mutants and controls at this time.

DESIGN
We dissociated P1 mouse brains and isolated microvessel fragments with their associated pericytes by affinity to anti-PECAM-coated magnetic beads. RNA was then isolated from four control (wild type) and four mutant (PDGFRb D849V knockin) brains, and then used to prepare labeled samples for array hybridization.
