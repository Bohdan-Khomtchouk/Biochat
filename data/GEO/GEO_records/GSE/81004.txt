TITLE
cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA of Corynebacterium glutamicum: identification, characterization, influence on cAMP level, growth, and global expression, and transcriptional activation by GlxR

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were applied to investigate the effect of cpdA deletion (del) or overexpression (over) on the global gene expression of C. glutamicum cells. For overexpression of cpdA the gene was cloned into plasmid pEKEx2 under control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter, which was induced by addition of 250 µM IPTG.

DESIGN
DNA microarray experiments were performed with three biological replicates. The transcriptome of C. glutamicum cells in which cpdA was either deleted (∆cpdA/pEKEx2) or overexpressed by plasmid-based expression (WT/pEKEx2-cpdA) was compared to the transcriptome of C. glutamicum wt cells containing empty plasmid pEKEx2 (WT/pEKEx2). For overexpression of CpdA, 250 µM IPTG was added to the medium (also for the control samples).
