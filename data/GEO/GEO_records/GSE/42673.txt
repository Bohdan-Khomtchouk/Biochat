TITLE
Identification of autoantigens recognized by the 2F5 and 4E10 broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize multiple clades of HIV-1 are polyreactive and bind avidly to mammalian autoantigens. Indeed, the generation of neutralizing antibodies to the 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes of HIV-1 gp41 in man may be proscribed by immune tolerance since mice expressing the VH and VL regions of 2F5 have a block in B-cell development characteristic of central tolerance. This developmental blockade implies the presence of tolerizing autoantigens that are mimicked by the membrane-proximal external region of HIV-1 gp41. Here we identify human kynureninase (KYNU) and splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3B3) as the primary conserved, vertebrate self-antigens recognized by the 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies, respectively. 2F5 binds the H4 domain of KYNU which contains the complete 2F5 linear epitope (ELDKWA). 4E10 recognizes a conformational epitope of SF3B3 that is strongly dependent on hydrophobic interactions. Opossums carry a rare KYNU H4 domain that abolishes 2F5 binding, but retain all SF3B3 4E10 epitopes. Immunization of opossums with HIV-1 gp140 induced extraordinary titers of serum antibody to the 2F5 ELDKWA epitope but little or nothing to the 4E10 determinant. Identification of structural motif shared by vertebrates and HIV-1 provides direct evidence that immunological tolerance can impair humoral responses to HIV-1.

DESIGN
The invitrogen protoarray that contains > 9,400 recombinant human proteins was used to identify self-ligands that are recognized by broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies 2F5 and 4E10. An isotype-matched human myeloma protein (151K, Southern Biotech) was used as control.
