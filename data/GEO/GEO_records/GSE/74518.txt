TITLE
Adult-induced cardiac-specific knockout of Parkin provokes minimal transcriptional effect

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult mice bearing homozygous floxed Parkin alleles (PMIDs 15249681, 21376232; T M Dawson), with or without the Myh6-driven MERCreMER transgene, were administered tamoxifen at 6-10 wks of age.  Tissues were obtained from euthanized mice 9-10 weeks after tamoxifen induction.

DESIGN
6 floxed, non-Cre (noninduced) mouse hearts; 6 floxed, MERCreMer, adult-induced, Parkin knockout mouse hearts

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
