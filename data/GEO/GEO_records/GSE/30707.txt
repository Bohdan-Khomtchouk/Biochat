TITLE
Inoculation of rice with the non-host pathogen Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici elicits an active transcriptional response

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare was inoculated with wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici, non-host pathogen to rice) to compare gene expression profiles with mock-inoculated controls.  Although eventually failed in invasion, leaf rust induced a set of rice genes that were distinctally up-regulated, some of those were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assays.

DESIGN
Rice leaves were heavily inoculated with a non-host pathogen, wheat leaf rust fungus, and compared with mock inoculation with 3 biological replications.
