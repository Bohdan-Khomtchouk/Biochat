TITLE
Methylation in breast cancer vs. normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied a combination of Methyl-CpG Immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and Human CpG Island microarrays to identify aberrant DNA methylation in eight low-grade breast invasive carcinomas and two pre-invasive breast tumors against ten normal breast tissues.

DESIGN
10 breast tumor samples (8 invasive, 2 pre-invasive) and 10 normal breast tissues, paired randomly (except Array 10: matched pair)
