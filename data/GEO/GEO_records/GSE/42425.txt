TITLE
MicroRNA expression in epithelial and stromal compartments of stage I human non-small cell lung cancer tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify tumor compartment-specific microRNA expression in stage I non-small cell lung cancer in humans, surgically resected and formalin-fixed tumor tissues were used in laser capture microdissection to isolate tumor epithelia and stroma. Total RNA extracted from the microdissectates was analyzed for microRNA expression using the 7th generation miRCURY™ locked nucleic acid microarray platform (Exiqon®, Vedbaek, Denmark).
