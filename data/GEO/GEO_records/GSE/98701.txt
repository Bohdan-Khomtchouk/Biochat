TITLE
Gene expression kinetics in Raw264.7 Cells following treatment with potential probiotics strains Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC-10307 and Bacillus clausii MTCC-8326 : NT (Time matched untreated cells) vs. Probiotics treated cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression kinetics in RAW 264.7 cells on treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC-10307 and Bacillus clausii MTCC-8326.

DESIGN
Eight conditions of the expriment, Untreated RAW 264.7 cells (NT) vs. treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC-10307 and Bacillus clausii MTCC-8326 separately at MOI of 100 with 4 time points. Biological replicates: 3 in each case (Equal amount of total RNA from each replicate pulled together for microarray).

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
