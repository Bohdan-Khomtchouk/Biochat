TITLE
EFTF vs GFP Experiment

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Xenopus laevis embryos were injected with mRNA for EFTFs at 2-cell stage. Animal caps collected at stage 9, cultured to the equivalent of stage 15 and RNA extracted. Four biological replicates of the EFTF-injected and GFP-injected (control) caps were used to profile transcript expression patterns using Affymetrix Xenopus Laevis GeneChip microarrays. Keywords: Two way comparison
