TITLE
miR-124 transfection time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This time course analysis is to study the targets and functions of miR-124. MiR-124 was overexpressed and the effect of miR-124 overexpression was compared to negative controls to identify downregulated genes and potential miRNA targets. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
one array for each time point of miR-124 and negative control transfections

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
