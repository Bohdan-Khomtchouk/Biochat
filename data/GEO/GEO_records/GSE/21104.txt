TITLE
Expression analysis of miR-499 transgenic heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that can affect gene expression.  We used microarrays to analyze gene expression in miR-499 transgenic mouse hearts.

DESIGN
Cardiac ventricles were collected at postnatal day 17 from wild type and miR-499 transgenics.
