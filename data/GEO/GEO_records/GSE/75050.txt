TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression in colorectal cancer tissues from patients with liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression to identify novel targets for the further study of liver metastasis in CRC. Samples obtained from CRC patients were analyzed using Arraystar human 8Ã—60K lncRNA/mRNA v3.0 microarrays chips to find differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs; The results were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified through fold-change filtering. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses were performed using standard enrichment computational methods.

DESIGN
Twelve primary CRC samples were obtained from six patients with CRC and liver metastasis (Exp G) and six patients with CRC without metastasis (Ctrl G).
