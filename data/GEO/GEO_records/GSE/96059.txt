TITLE
Next Generation sequencing and quantitative transcriptomic analysis in -77+/+ and -77-/- erythroid precursors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of sorted erythroid precursors from E14.5 wild-type (WT) and -77 enhancer knockout (-77-/-)  mouse fetal liver were generated by next generation sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq2500 (1X50). We showed that the Gata2 -77 enhancer generated the vital erythroid precursor Burst Forming Unit-Erythroid by two mechanisms, GATA-1 upregulation to establish the erythroid transcriptome and GATA-2-dependent, GATA-1-independent transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Erythroid precursor gene expression profiles of E14.5 mouse -77+/+ and -77-/- mouse fetal livers were generated by next generation sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq2500 (1X50).
