TITLE
Gene expression in Longissimus lumborum and Semimembranosus skeletal muscles in pig using the GenmascqChip (custom 15K Agilent microarray)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling between two different skeletal muscles (Longissimus and Semimembranosus) in pig

DESIGN
The 90 pigs (females and barrows) used in gene expression analyses are part of a larger F2 population of 1,000 animals, setup within the framework of a QTL detection program. These animals were produced as a second generation intercross between two commercial sire lines (F016, Pietrain type line, and FH019, synthetic line from Hampshire, Duroc and Large-White founders, FRANCE-HYBRIDES, St Jean de Braye, France).

PLATFORM
GPL11445 [Agilent-019442] Agilent/INRA FH Sus scrofa 15K muscle array [Probe Name version]
