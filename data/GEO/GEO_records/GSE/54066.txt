TITLE
Human Hepatocytes with Drug Metabolic Function Induced from Fibroblasts by Lineage Reprogramming

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated induced human hepatocyte by transduction of several lineage specific transcription factors and analyzed the gene expression profile of generated hepatocytes and freshly isolated human hepatocytes through RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profile analysis

PLATFORM
