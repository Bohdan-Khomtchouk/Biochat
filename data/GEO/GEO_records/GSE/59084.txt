TITLE
Effects of caffeine ingestion in Drosophila melanogaster male thorax and abdomen.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To screen for xenobiotic-metabolizing-enzyme genes (XME) induced by caffeine exposure, a microarray experiment (performed with a Drosophila pangenomic array (Agilent 4 X 44K) was carried out between control and individuals exposed to caffeine (18mM ). Among 23401 genes consistantly found in the three biological replicates, 13108 showed a significant variation. 749 genes were over-expressed whereas 1518 were under-expressed. Interestingly, several genes belonging to all major classes of detoxification enzymes including XME were among the most highly induced such as CYP12d1, CYP6a8 and CYP6d5.

DESIGN
Caffeine ingestion induced gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster male thorax and abdomen was mesured at 12h after exposure to doses of 0, 18mM of caffeine. Three independant experiments were performed at each dose using different drosophila for each experiment.
