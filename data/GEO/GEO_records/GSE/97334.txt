TITLE
CNA analysis of ionizing radiation related basal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
gDNA from patient samples with multiple basal cell carcinomas and possible exposure to ionizing radiation was hybridized Vs. GM12878 gDNA to assess CNAs. We aimed to find a possible common aberration pattern related to ionizing radiation or a rare metastasis.

DESIGN
6 cancer samples (BCC) Vs. GM12878 control gDNA
