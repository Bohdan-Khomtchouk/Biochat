TITLE
Identification of miRNAs regulated by TGF-b in human CD8+ T cells (small RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the current study was to identify miRNAs regulated by TGF-b in human CD8+ T cells and analyze the function of these miRNAs in shaping the immunomodulatory effect of TGF-b in these cells. We identified the miR-23a cluster to be upregulated and found that this cluster could target key molecules (IFN-g and LAMP1) involved in immune response by CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells were isolated and purified from healthy human peripheral blood of 5 donors and were activated using beads coupled to anti-CD2, anti-CD3 and anti-CD24. They were then treated with 5ng/ml TGF-b, with 1ÂµM SD-208 or left untreated. RNA from these cells were then isolated and used for deep sequencing.
