TITLE
Gene expression of Mus exposed to chronic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High altitude environments are characterized by the unique and unavoidable stress of chronic hypoxia. While much is known about gene expression responses to acute or in vitro hypoxia, less is known about the gene expression profiles of animals exposed to systemic chronic hypoxia, such as that experienced at high elevations. Here we simulated the hypoxic environment of two high altitude elevations,and a third chamber recieved ambient Reno air. Mice were housed in the hypoxic chambers for 32 days. We used microarrays to characterize the differential gene expression in the livers of mice housed in hypoxic environment of 4500 m versus 3000 and 1400 m. We used this data to draw hypotheses related to novel physiological responses to chronic systemic hypoxia
