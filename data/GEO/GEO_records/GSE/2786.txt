TITLE
loss of paradormancy in underground adventitious buds of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula)

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
This study is a time course of growth induction (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs) following the breaking of paradormancy in underground buds of the perennial weed leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). Keywords: Time course, growth induction, apical dominance, paradormancy, root buds, leafy spurge

DESIGN
Two independently isolated samples for each time point was compared to a single control sample (also independently isolated) collected from paradormant underground adeventitious buds. Dye swaps were done for each time point (not each biological replicate).

PLATFORM
GPL2524 Euphorbiaceae chip1
