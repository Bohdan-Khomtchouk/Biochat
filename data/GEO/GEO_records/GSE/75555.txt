TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of bovine inner cell mass and trophectoderm derived from in vivo generated blastocysts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
This study describes the generation and analysis of the transcriptional profile of bovine inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE), obtained from in vivo developed embryos by using a bovine-embryo specific array (EmbryoGENE) containing 37,238 probes.

DESIGN
Four replicates of bovine inner cell mass (ICM) and four replicates of trophectoderm (TE), obtained from in vivo developed embryos recolted at day 7.5 post-insemination. TE was used as reference (control). The hybridization were done in a dye-swap design.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
