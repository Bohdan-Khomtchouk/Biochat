TITLE
Splenic B1 and B2 cells from mice with induced deletion of Ikaros

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment aimed at determining the genes that are under the control of the Ikaros transcription factor in mouse splenic B1 and B2 B lymphocyte subsets. To this aim, we used Ikf/f R26-CreERT2+ (Cre+) or Ikf/f R26-CreERT2- (Cre-) mice, which correspond to mice with floxed null alleles for Ikzf1 (Heizmann et al., JEM 210:2823-32, 2013) that were crossed with the R26-CreERT2 mice, which harbor a knock-in of the cDNA encoding the tamoxifen (TAM) inducible CreERT2 recombinase in the Rosa26 gene (Badea et al, J. Neurosci 23:2314-22, 2003). 6-8 week-old mice were injected daily with TAM for 3d (50mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed 10d after the first injection, and splenic B1 and B2 B cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. Splenic B1 and B2 cells from mice with induced deletion of Ikaros
