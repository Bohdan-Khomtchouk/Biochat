TITLE
Expression data from Pin1 inhibitor ATRA and Pin1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ATRA was identified as a Pin1 inhibitor via fluorescence polarization-based high throughput screening.  We performed microarray expression profiling to demonstrate the similarity between ATRA and Pin1 KD at the genome-wide level

DESIGN
APL NB4 cells in response to ATRRA or inducible Pin1 knockdown for 3 days were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to validate in genome-wide level whether similarity occurred between ATRA and Pin1 knockdown-treated NB4 cells.
