TITLE
Cultured fibroblasts treated with microvesicles from cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of microvesicles exocytosed by cardiomyocytes. The aims of the study were to determine if microvesicles from cardiomyocytes are capable of affecting fibroblasts and causes changes in gene expression. The study showed that cardiomyocytes microvesicles are capable to cause change in gene expression in fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Microvesicles were purified from media from cultured cardiomyocytes and transfered to cultured fibroblasts. Gene expression in fibroblasts were analyzed with Illumina Beadstation. Two replicates fibroblasts controls and two replicates of fibroblasts transfected with microvesicle from cultured cardiomyocytes were compared.
