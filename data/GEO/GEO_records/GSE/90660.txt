TITLE
ChIP-Seq of constitutively expressed Ndt80-Myc in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the genes bound by Ndt80 in S. cerevisiae when constitutively expressed, for the native Ndt80 as well as a heterologous Ndt80 from Pichia pastoris. For the ChIPs on the native Ndt80s, Ndt80 was tagged with c-myc; for the heterologous ChIP P. pastoris Ndt80 was integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome and tagged with c-myc.  In both cases, the native Ndt80 promoter was also replaced with an A. gossypii Gal1 promoter and the protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-myc antibody.  Cells were grown overnight in SRaffinose until log-phase, then in SRaffinose + 1.7% Galactose for 5 hours.  Each experiment was repeated twice and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae Ndt80-myc vs. untagged control and heterologous P. pastoris Ndt80-myc in S. cerevisiae vs. untagged control, with two technical replicates for each
