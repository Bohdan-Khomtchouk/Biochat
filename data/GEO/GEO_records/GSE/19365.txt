TITLE
Genome wide mapping of Jarid2 and Suz12 binding sites in mouse ES cells before and after Jarid2 depletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the overlap in genome wide binding sites between Jarid2 and Suz12 in mouse ES cells and find that Jarid2 and Suz12 peaks have an high degree (90%) of overlap. Moreover we analyzed the effect of Jarid2 down regulation on genome wide Suz12 binding sites and found that Loss of Jarid2 lead to the loss of 70% of Suz12 binding sites and to a 10 Fold reduction in intensity for 90% of Suz12 binding sites. Overall, these results demonstrate that Jarid2 plays an essential role for Suz12 (PRC2 complex) association to DNA.

DESIGN
Examination of two different proteins in two different cell lines
