TITLE
Gene expression profiling of s-SHIP positive mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNAseq on subpopulations of mammary epithelial cells.  We carried out sorting of a gradient of s-SHIP positive cells in the mammary gland (neg, low, and hi for s-SHIP eGFP).  High sSHIP-eGFP populations denote a postulated stem cell population, while low and negative represent more differentiated cell types.  s-SHIP eGFP hi to negative potentially represents a gradient from stem to more differentiated progeny, respectively, within the basal epithelial compartment.  We FACS sorted 3 replicates for each cell type to represent s-SHIP-neg, s-SHIP-low, and s-SHIP-high.

DESIGN
We FACS sorted 3 replicates for each cell type to represent s-SHIP-neg, s-SHIP-low, and s-SHIP-high, profiling each of these groups using RNA sequencing.
