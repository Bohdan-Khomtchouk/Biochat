TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of PP2C genes in Brachypodium distachyon of different tissues and under multiple stresses

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
PP2C genes responding to 13 stresses were screened using qPCR. All sampes were repeated with 3 times and ACTIN were regarded as house keeping gene.The stresses including heavy metal treatments, environmental factors,phytohormones and biotic treatments.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. The 2 weeks-seedlings were used and 2 Âµg of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis by using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TAKARA).
