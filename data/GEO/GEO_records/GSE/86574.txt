TITLE
Characterization of Two Novel Ependymoma Cell Lines with Chromosome 1q gain derived from Posterior Fossa Tumors of Childhood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Introduction: Ependymoma (EPN) studies have revealed certain genetic markers, such as gain of chromosome 1q (1q+), as indicators of poor survival and high rate of recurrence. Development of novel therapeutics for EPN has been hampered by a lack of in vivo and in vivo models. We describe two unique 1q+ cell lines (811 and 928) derived from two children with metastatic, recurrent EPN. Both cell lines were characterized using histological, karyotypic and transcriptomic methods Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both lines, when cultured in 3D format, clustered closer to primary EPN tumors than monolayer format and with better fidelity of EPN-specific transcripts, namely those related to cilia function. Additionally, 3D culture histology revealed striking ependymal rosette formation, similar to primary tumors. Transcriptional enrichment of extracellular matrix, however, was a common signature of EPN primary tumor and cell lines in both monolayer and 3D formats.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from cell cultures, surgical tumor and normal brain samples (n=110) using Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips (Platform GPL570).

PLATFORM
