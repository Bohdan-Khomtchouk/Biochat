TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression analysis identifies a unique molecular profile and macrophage infiltration in undifferentiated uterine sarcomas [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sarcomas originating from the endometrial stroma include low- and high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) that are associated with specific translocations, and highly malignant undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (UUS). UUS is considered a poorly defined group of tumors and is often seen as a “diagnosis of exclusion” after ESS and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) have been ruled out. Through gene expression profiling, we show that UUS form a well-defined group of tumors with a unique genetic profile distinct from LMS and both subtypes of ESS.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 25 frozen tumor samples from 9 low-grade ESS cases, 8 UUS cases and 4 high-grade ESS cases and 4 uterine LMS cases; Agilent One-Color technology.
