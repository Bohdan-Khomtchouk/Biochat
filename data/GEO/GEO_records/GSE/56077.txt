TITLE
Transcription factor Runx1 cooperates with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate the balance of myoblast proliferation/differentiation [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx1 is expressed in regenerating muscle, specifically in the muscle adult stem cells- the satellite cells. Its exact role and target genes were yet to be identified. We report here Runx1 and potential TF counterparts bind important muscle differentiation related genes

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide chromatin binding of several TFs in primary myoblasts (PM)

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
