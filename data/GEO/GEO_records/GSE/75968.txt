TITLE
microRNA expression profile related to lymph node status in women with stage grade 1-2-3 endometrial cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether microRNA profiles of grade 1 – 2 or 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas can be related to nodal status and used as a tool to adapt surgical staging in early-stage EC. MicroRNA expression were assessed in twelve formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) EC primary tumors with positive lymph node and in 36 FFPE EC primary tumors with negative lymph node, matched for grade, stage and lymphovascular space involvement status.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 36 specimens of negative LN status were pooled by 3 in accordance with the matching criteria. Microarray analysis was conducted on 48 distinct specimens: Twelve specimens with positive LN and 36 specimens with negative LN. Microarray hybridization on miRNA 4.0 chips (Affymetrix) was conducted at the genomic platform of the Institut Cochin, Paris.
