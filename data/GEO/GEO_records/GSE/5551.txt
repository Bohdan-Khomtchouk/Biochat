Transcriptional Response of Human Macrophages to Legionella pneumophila Infection

SUMMARY
Abstract Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaireâ€™s disease, grows within macrophages and manipulates target cell signaling.  Formation of a Legionella-containing replication vacuole requires the function of the bacterial type IV secretion system (Dot/Icm), which transfers protein substrates into the host cell cytoplasm.  A global microarray analysis was used to examine the response of human macrophage-like U937 cells to low dose infections with L. pneumophila. The most striking change in expression was the Dot/Icm-dependent up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes positively controlled by the transcriptional regulator NF-?B.  Consistent with this finding, L. pneumophila triggered nuclear localization of NF-?B in human and mouse macrophage in a Dot/Icm-dependent manner.  The mechanism of activation at low dose infections involved a signaling pathway that occurred independently of the TLR adaptor MyD88, and cytoplasmic sensor Nod1.  In contrast, high MOI conditions caused a host cell response that masked the unique Dot/Icm-dependent activation of NF-?B.  Inhibition of NF-?B translocation into the nucleus resulted in premature host cell death and termination of bacterial replication.  In the absence of one anti-apoptotic protein, PAI-2, host cell death increased in response to L. pneumophila infection, indicating that induction of anti-apoptotic genes is critical for host cell survival. Keywords: time course, dose response
