TITLE
Expression data from human peripheral blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile based classification of colonic diseases are suitable for identification of diagnostic mRNA expression patterns which can establish the basis of a new molecular biological diagnostic method. Keywords: whole genomic expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples Diverticulitis and Infective colitis were hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
