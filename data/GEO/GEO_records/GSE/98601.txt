TITLE
Analysis of the miR-34 family functions in breast cancer reveals annotation error of miR-34b

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miR-34 family of microRNAs consisting of miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c are tumour suppressors. The annotated human miR-34b-5p has one additional base at the 5â€™ end of the common miR-34 family seed sequence, compared to miR-34a-5p and miR-34c-5p. This extra base results in a shift of the seed sequence, which would affect the target gene repertoire and have functional consequences. During our studies of miR-34 functions, we investigated the precise sequence of mature miR-34b-5p in human cells by deep sequencing. We found that a miR-34b-5p without the extra base was the predominant form in both non-malignant and malignant cells derived from several human tissues, indicating that the miR-34b annotation is misleading. We evaluated the functional implications of the seed shift, by comparing the effect of mimics representing the alternative miR-34b-5p sequences in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast to the annotated miR-34b, the endogenously expressed miR-34b displayed tumour suppressive characteristics in vitro similarly to miR-34c. These data demonstrate the importance of determining the precise sequence of a mature microRNA before exploring miRNA functions.
