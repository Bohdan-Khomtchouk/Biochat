TITLE
Development of gene sets after deleting Rb in p53 null background primary prostate cells [Rb only]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our findings suggested that cytokines were upregulated in p53 null primary prostate cells after deleting Rb. Rb deletion is important for prostate cancer progression.

DESIGN
p53-/- Rbf/f vs p53-/- Rb∆f/∆f primary prostate cells.Three independent experiments were performed.
