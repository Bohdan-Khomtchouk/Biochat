RNA Maps Reveal New RNA Classes and a Possible Function for Pervasive Transcription

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the relations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt are investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three novel potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.
