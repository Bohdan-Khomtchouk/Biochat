TITLE
Expression profiling in the heart of wild-type and kctd10 mutant zebrafish larvae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA of hearts from 50 wild-type and 50 kctd10 mutant embryos at 48 hpf.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in the larvae hearts between the the wt and the kctd10 mutant.
