TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of Colletotrichum orbiculare during appressorium formation in vitro and in planta

ORGANISM
Colletotrichum orbiculare

SUMMARY
Elucidation of the involvement of MOR (morphogenesis-related NDR kinase network) pathway in the gene expression during appressorium development in planta, transcriptome analyses at the stage of appressorium formation (4 hours post inoculation) in vitro and in planta were performed and revealed that MOR is responsible for the expression of a subset of the plant signal induced genes with potential roles in pathogenicity.

DESIGN
We collected samples from germinating conidia incubated on the polystyrene petri dishes (in vitro) for 4 h of the wild type strain 104-T or Cbk1-CA strain, and incubated on cucumber cotyledons (in planta) for 4 h of the wild type or pag1Î”. Three replicates were performed for each experiment.
