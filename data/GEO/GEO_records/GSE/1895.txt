TITLE
M1 and M6 serotypes, Wild-type vs. Mga- GAS

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
JRS4 is our wild-type M6 serotype GAS and JRS519 is our Mga- M6 serotype GAS.  SF370 is our wild-type M1 serotype GAS and KSM165L is our Mga- M1 serotype GAS. Table 1:  Genomic Normalization Description:  Step by Step instructions for the removal of outlier background data and any ORF data that did not meet threshold of 2SD above background average, using original data from gpr file provided in each of the sample files. Table 2:  M1 Mga+ vs Mga- Description:  Step by Step instructions for the removal of outlier data as compared across all possible data points for each ORF.  Data points after genomic normalization are used with resultant averages and standard deviations for each ORF computed. Table 3: M6 Mga+ vs Mga- Description:  Step by Step instructions for the removal of outlier data as compared across all possible data points for each ORF.  Data points after genomic normalization are used with resultant averages and standard deviations for each ORF computed. Keywords: repeat sample
