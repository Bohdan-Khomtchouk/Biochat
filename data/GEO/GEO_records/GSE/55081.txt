TITLE
Expression data from yeast wild type (WT) and sod1Δ strains after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
An important cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress is the induction of genes involved in ROS resistance and DNA damage repair. Under normal conditions, Sod1 is localized mainly in the cytosol. However, we found that Sod1 translocates into the nucleus after oxidative stress. To address the physiological role of Sod1, we performed DNA microarray analysis of global gene expression in wild type (WT) and sod1Δ cells before and after treatment with H2O2.

DESIGN
Early log phase WT and sod1Δ cells were treated with or without H2O2 for 20 min and RNA samples were extracted and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We then compared the dataset of WT +/- H2O2 with SOD1 deleted cells +/- H2O2 to identify the H2O2-responsive genes whose induction was attenuated in sod1Δ cells by more than 50%.
