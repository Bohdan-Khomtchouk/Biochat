TITLE
The gene regulation of SPANXA in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SPANXA is identified as a cancer-testis antigens expressed in normal testis but dysregulated in various tumors. It plays unknown roles. This study sought to investigate the effects of the nuclear protein, SPANXA, on the biological behavior and global gene expression profiles of lung cancer cells. Expression microarray and bioinformatics analyses indicated that SPANXA mainly regulated genes involved EMT pathways in CL1-5 cells, a pattern that correlated with the altered behavior of CL1-5 cells observed after overexpressed SPANXA. We used microarrays to identify the global gene alterations in lung cancer cells CL1-5 after ectopic expressing SPANXA.

DESIGN
Ectopic expressing SPANXA-V5 and vector in low-expressed SPANXA lung cancer cell line, CL1-5
