TITLE
mRNA-seq of Physcomitrella protonema responding to 1 hr red light in wild type and the phytochrome-deficient mutant

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
The red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome mediates photomorphological responses in plants. For light sensing and signaling, phytochromes need to associate with open-chain tetrapyrrole molecules as the chromophore. Biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole chromophores requires members of ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs). There are two FDBRs in Physcomitrella patens, HY2 and PUBS. Knocking out both generates the phytochrome-deficient mutant. Datasets here provides the transcriptome profiling of Physcomitrella protonema grown in the dark and exposed to one hour red light. Wild type and the hy2 pubs double mutant were used to dissect the regulated genes of moss phytochromes. For details, please see PMID:  .

DESIGN
4 samples, dark-grown wild-type and pubs hy2 protonema as time 0 control, followed by red light irradiation for one hour respectively
