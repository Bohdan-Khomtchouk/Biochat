TITLE
Analysis of the microRNA that involved the tuberculosis or latent TB infection II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To get to know the different levels of the microRNA among the pulmonary tuberculosis patients, latent-infected individuals and the complete healthy people, we have employed the Agilent miRNA microarray (version 2.0) as a discovery platform to identify microRNA with the potential to diagnose the TB patients and the latent infected persons. The Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of each group were made up of equally mixed quantity of  3 volunteers. The results showed that several microRNAs were found up- or low regulated in PBMCs of TB patients versus latent-infected individuals and similarly for latent-infected individuals versus complete healthy ones.
