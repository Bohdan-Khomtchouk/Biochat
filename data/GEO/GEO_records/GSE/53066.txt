TITLE
Anaylsis of the effect of down-regulation of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in Ewing Sarcoma cells by RNA-seq.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated A673 Ewing Sarcoma cell lines which stably express shRNA targeting the EWS-FLI1 fuison protein or Luciferase as a control to study the effect of EWS-FLI1 on the transcriptome. The vectors used to generate the cell lines were a gift from Stephen Lessnick and were first published in PMID 16697960

DESIGN
We analysed five A673 cell lines in which the EWS-FLI1 fusion is down-reagulated by shRNA and three control cell lines which express shRNA targeting Luciferase.
