TITLE
Difference of gene expression after knockdown CRNDE expression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes targeted by CRNDE and explore the mechanism of action of CRNDE on CRC tumorigenesis, gene expression profiling was performed on CRNDE knockdown DLD1 cells s and on control cells.

DESIGN
Either of the stable cell lines,DLD1-NC and DLD1-shCRNDE,is collected three times independently.

PLATFORM
