Human mesenchymal stem cells at 24 hours and 0.5% O2, gene expression and exon array, three independent biological replicates

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell source for autologous transplantation in many human diseases. To better realize their in vivo therapeutic potential, hypoxia preconditioning has become a novel strategy to improve the survival, migration, and angiogenic capability of MSCs. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of hypoxia preconditioning on MSCs, we respectively used standard expression microarray and exon microarray to investigate the global profiling of gene expression and alternative splicing in hypoxia preconditioned-MSCs, and the detection sensitivity of differential gene expression using exon microarray and standard expression microarray was compared. A total of 414 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed using standard expression microarray, while only 72 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed using exon microarray, suggesting that standard expression microarray should be preferred if exclusively to detect changes in gene level. Our finding generated a global profiling of gene expression and alternative splicing which may be responsible for enhanced therapeutic effect of the hypoxia preconditioned-hMSCs. Our work provides a general framework for the systematic study of stem cell biology under clinically relevant pathophysiologic conditions

DESIGN
Gene expression/alternative splicing in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) isolated from human bone marrow were measured after exposure to 0.5% O2 or 21% O2 for 24 hours using  gene expression array/exon array. Three independent experiments were performed using different donors for each experiment for both gene expression array analysis and exon array analysis.
