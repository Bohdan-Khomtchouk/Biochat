TITLE
B. pseudomallei K96243 genome: Control vs. B. pseudomallei environmental or clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Burkholderia pseudomallei

SUMMARY
To use whole genome microarrays to compare the differences in genome contents of 5 B. pseudomallei isolated from clinical specimens and environmental sample with B. pseudomallei K96243 reference strain and reveals variable patterns of Genomic Islands (GIs) Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
DNA microarrays were used to compare genome of clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates with B. pseudomallei K96243 reference strain (B. pseudomallei K96243 vs. B. pseudmallei isolates). Each hybridization was used for comparison between B. pseudomallei K96243 as a reference strain with environmental isolate BP45s, environmental isolate BP28L, clinical isolate H307, clinical isolate P54, clinical isolate P82. Two replicate per array. Multiple hits with 90-99.99 % identity correspond to other locus are replicate of their genes were averaged and analyzed.
