TITLE
Expression profiling of motor cortex in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used oligonucleotide microarrays to find differentially expressed genes between control subjects and those affected by sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Complementary RNAs (cRNAs) labelled with Cy5-CTP (Perkin-Elmer) were synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA of each sample of human motor cortex using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A reference cRNA, labelled with Cy3-CTP (Perkin-Elmer), was synthesized from 1 µg of sample Diseased 2 RNA. Aliquots (750 ng) of Cy3 and Cy5 labelled cRNA targets were co-hybridized on Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (Agilent Technologies). Microarray hybridization and washing were performed using reagents and instruments (hybridization chambers and rotating oven) as indicated by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies). Microarrays were scanned at 10-μm resolution using a GenePix Personal 4100A microarray scanner and the GenePix Pro 6.0 acquisition and data-extraction software (Molecular Devices, Corp.).
