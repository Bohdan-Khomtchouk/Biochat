TITLE
Genome wide DRIP-seq in E2 stimulated MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We mapped the location of RNA-DNA hybrids in hormone-starved MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with the hormone estradiol (E2.) E2 is a potent transcriptional activator, and causes proliferation in hormone starved cells. We find a significant induction of hybrids at genes known to be regulated by the estrogen receptor.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA:DNA hybrid levels in MCF7 cells treated with two different time points of estradiol, and a mock control
