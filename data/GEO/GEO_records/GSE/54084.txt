TITLE
Otx2 ChIP-seq in the adult mouse Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) and neural retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Otx2 has been shown to be non cell autonomously required for photoreceptor cell survival in the adult mouse RPE. This study aims to identify Otx2 DNA binding profile in both RPE and neural retina to i) identify direct targets of Otx2 in the RPE ii) compare Otx2 binding profile in neural retina and RPE to unveil hidden functions in the neural retina.

DESIGN
WT and GFP antibodies were used to perform two independent ChIP-seq experiments using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
