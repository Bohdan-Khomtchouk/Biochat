TITLE
Gene expression signatures between lean and diabetes resistant B6 mice and obese and diabetes susceptible NZO mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray expression was measured in metabolic active tissues (gonadal white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) of 6 week old mice to detect changes in gene expression related to early onset of diabetes and obesity.

DESIGN
Male NZO and B6 mice were kept on a high fat diet (HFD) until week 6. Than samples of gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle were aliquoted for RNA extraction
