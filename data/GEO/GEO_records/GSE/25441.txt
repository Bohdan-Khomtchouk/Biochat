TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Salmonella enterica regulatory mutants

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The study aims to determine the effects of mutants and deletions of several known regulators on S. enterica gene expression.

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos.  Samples were hybridized with at least one flip dye experiment. Cells were grown in media LB or LPM and RNA harvest at mid log or stationary phase.

PLATFORM
GPL10213 JCVI PFGRC Salmonella typhimurium 13K v8 array designed primarily based on strain 14028
