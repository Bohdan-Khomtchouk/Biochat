TITLE
Association of Taf14 with acetylated histone H3 directs the DNA damage response and gene transcription

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from triplicate log-phase cultures of BY4741 (WT) transformed with pRS313-HA3-SSN6 and taf14D transformed with pRS313-HA3-SSN6 (empty vector), full-length pRS313-TAF14-HA3-SSN6, or pRS313-taf14W81A-HA3-SSN6 cultured in synthetic complete media lacking histidine.

DESIGN
Examination of changes in gene expression when the YEATS domain of Taf14 is mutated so it cannot bind acetyl-H3.
