TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse tracheal mesenchymal cells before and 48hrs after SO2 injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conducting airway epithelium of the rodent and human lung is underlaid by mesenchymal cells that include vasculature, smooth muscle, fibroblasts and cartilage. The goal of this project is to identify cellular and molecular changes in the mesenchyme after injury to the epithelium by exposure to SO2 and which may participate in repair of the epithelium We used Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare transcripts in tracheal mesenchyme before and after SO2 injury.

DESIGN
Mice tracheal epithelium and mesenchyme were separate for RNA extraction before and 48hrs after SO2 injury. Sample from 4 mice were pooled  for each biological experiment. The experiments were repeated three times for triplicate samples.
