TITLE
FoxD-a/b ChIP-chip on Ciona intestinalis embryo (32-cell stage)

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A genomic overview of in vivo binding of a transcription factor FoxD-a/b in the ascidian 32-cell stage embryo.

DESIGN
Fertilized eggs were electroporated with a construct encoding GFP-tagged FoxD-a/b. After fixation, chromatin was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average of size of 1kb. The DNA fragments were enriched by immunoprecipitation with an polyclonal antibody specific for GFP (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated and WCE (Whole Cell Extract) DNA were amplified by LM-PCR for the Chip analysis. Two independent experiments were performed to reduce experimental errors.
