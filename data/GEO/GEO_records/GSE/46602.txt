Expression data from prostate cancer and benign prostate glands

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death amongst males. The main clinical dilemma in treating prostate cancer is the high number of indolent cases that confer a significant risk of over diagnosis and over treatment. In this study we have performed a genome expression profiling of tumor tissue specimens from 36 patients with prostate cancer to identify transcripts that delineate aggressive and indolent cancer. We included normal prostate biopsies from 14 patients in our analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis separated the cancer samples into two groups with a significant overrepresentation of tumors from patients with biochemical recurrence in one of the groups (Chi2, p=0.02). The samples were separated by basically three clusters of genes that showed differential expression between the two sample clusters - totaling 371 transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that one cluster contained genes associated with invasive properties of the tumor, another genes associated with the cell cycle, and the last cluster genes involved in several biological functions. We successfully validated the transcripts association with recurrence using two publicly available patient datasets totaling 669 patients. Twelve genes were found to be independent predictors of recurrence in multivariate logistical regression analysis.
