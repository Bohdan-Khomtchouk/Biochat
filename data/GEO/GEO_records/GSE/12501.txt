TITLE
Gene Expression in MEFs Trisomic for Chromosomes 1, 13, 16 and 19

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aneuploidy, an incorrect chromosome number, is the leading cause of miscarriages and mental retardation in humans and is a hallmark of cancer. We examined the effects of aneuploidy on primary mouse cells by generating a series of cell lines that carry an extra copy of one of four mouse chromosomes. In all four trisomic lines proliferation was impaired and metabolic properties were altered. Immortalization, the acquisition of the ability to proliferate indefinitely, was also affected by the presence of an additional chromosome, with some chromosomes inhibiting immortalization while others accelerating the process. Our data indicate that aneuploidy decreases not only organismal but also cellular fitness and elicits traits that are shared between different aneuploid cells. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
The mRNAs from 9 different mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) lines with a normal complement of chromosomes were compared to mRNAs from 1 MEF line with three copies of chromosome 1, 4 MEF lines with three copies of chrmosome 13, 3 MEF lines with three copies of chromosome 16 and 1 MEF line with three copies of chromosome 19.
