TITLE
Deciphering KRAS and NRAS mutated clones dynamics in MLL-AF4 pediatric leukemia by ultra deep sequencing analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the KRAS and NRAS mutational status in pediatric MLL-AF4+ leukemia patients by means of ultra deep amplicon sequencing. The gene expression profiles of RAS wild type and RAS mutated patients were investigated by gene expression analysis. We showed that mutated patients were characterized by a RAS related expression signature.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix platform in 9 BCP-ALL MLL-AF4+ patients at diagnosis with avaible information on their KRAS and NRAS mutational status
