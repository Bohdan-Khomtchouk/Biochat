TITLE
Maturation,not initiation, is major roadblock during reprogramming toward pluripotency from human fibrobalsts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reprogrammed cells are reverted to non reprogrammed cell fate in a maturation step of reprogramming.

DESIGN
Cell fate changes during reprogramming from fibroblasts to iPSC , N=60  fibrobalst lines, N=13  Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, N=16  Nascent reprogrammed cells, N=31
