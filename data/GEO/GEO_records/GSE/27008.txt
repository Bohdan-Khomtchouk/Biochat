TITLE
Human gene expression altered by Chlamydia infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human coronary artery endothelial cells were infected with Chlamydophila pneumoniae. We monitor cellular gene expression profiling altered by life cycle of Chlamydophila pneumoniae using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

DESIGN
5 time points were measured, 5min, 25min, 2h, 24h, 60h after infection

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
