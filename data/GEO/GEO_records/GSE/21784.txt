TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis during aging in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Aging has been shown to be under genetic control in C. elegans. We performed Affymetrix micorarray-based transcriptional profililng of wild type C. elegans strain Bristol N2 during aging to detect temporal changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared for hybridization to Affy microarrays from synchronized populations of C. elegans at three points during aging: 1) the late larval L4 stage, 2) day 6 of adulthood, and 3) day 15 of adulthood.
