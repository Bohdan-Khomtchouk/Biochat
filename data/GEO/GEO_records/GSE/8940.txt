TITLE
MGAS5005 rivRX knockout vs. rivRX overexpressing strain

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
JRS1616/pREG696 is our MGAS5005 covR rivRX double knockout carrying empty vector. JRS1616/pJRS1624 is our covR rivRX double knockout carrying a plasmid which overexpresses rivRX. Keywords: comparitive transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
Four separate RNA preparations from each strain (RNA #A-D) were hybridized to duplicate arrays. Reference RNA consisted of pooled RNA from each preparation, labelled with Cy5.

PLATFORM
GPL5822 Streptococcus pyogenes M1, M3, M18 GAS 2.3k array (condensed version)
