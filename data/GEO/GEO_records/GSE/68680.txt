TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of SREB during yeast phase growth of Blastomyces dermatitidis at 37oC

ORGANISM
Blastomyces dermatitidis ATCC 26199

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analysis was used to identify B. dermatitidis genes bound by the GATA transcription factor encoded by SREB during growth as yeast at 37oC

DESIGN
SREB was engineered to contain an in-frame 3x-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the C-terminus. The SREB-3xHA construct was under control of its native promoter and contained the 3-untranslated region.  Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, B. dermatitidis ATCC 26199 was transformed with the SREB-3xHA construct (referred to a SREB-3xHA strain in this document).  The SREB-3xHA construct was functional because retransformation of SREBΔ with the construct complented the null mutant. Chromatin was extracted and sheared from ATCC 26199 and SREB-3xHA yeast grown in liquid Histoplasma macrophage medium (HMM) containing 10 μM iron sulfate (FeSO4) at 37oC.  ATCC 26199 was the untagged control strain.
