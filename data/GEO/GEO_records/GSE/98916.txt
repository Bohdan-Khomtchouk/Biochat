TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in mechanical stimulated invasion assay [extracellular and adhesion]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were seeded onto a 3D collagen-fibronectin matrix and mechanical stimulation in the form of tugging forces was applied to the matrix. Cells not stimulated were used as the control group. The aim of this study was to examine which genes related to ECM and adhesion were deferentially expressed when the mechanical stimulation was applied to the matrix compared to unstimulated, control cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed: unstimulated and stimulated
