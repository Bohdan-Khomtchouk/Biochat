TITLE
Identification of rapamycin as an autophagy inducer to treat PANC-1 cells [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The function and mechanism of autophagy in pancreatic cancer remained elusive owing to its complex biological process and multi-molecular involvement including non-coding RNAs. Here, we, from the view of mRNA, circRNA, lncRNA and miRNA, investigate the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction on human pancreatic cancer cells

DESIGN
The autophagy-induced model was constructed with PANC-1 cells treated by rapamycin. It was indicated that 100ÂµM rapamycin was the best choice to induce the autophagy of PANC-1 in humans.
