TITLE
Expression data from KDM3A knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer invasive growth, metastasis and therapeutic resistance affects the clinical ourcome. We explored the epigenetic mechanisms that control these process in breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 by knocking down a lysine specific demethylase KDM3A We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was infected with scramble or KDM3A shRNA. After selection, the cells were used for microarray analysis.
