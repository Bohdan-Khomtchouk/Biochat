TITLE
Expression of Cdx2 or Gata3 in R1 mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify whether Cdx2 or Gata3 can activate trophoblast specific gene expression when expressed in R1 ES cells. To assess the dependency of Gata3 activity on Cdx2, Gata3 was also expressed in Cdx2-null ES cells. Keywords: gene expression
