TITLE
Expression data from DKAT and other breast cancer cell lines under baseline growth conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DKAT cell line is a novel model of triple-negative breast cancer that was isolated from the pleural effusion of a 35 year-old caucasian woman with triple-negative breast cancer. We used microarrays to look at gene expression in the DKAT cell line compared to several other commonly-used breast cancer cell lines as well as a previously published data set in order to determine the molecular subtype of the DKAT cell line.

DESIGN
DKAT, HMEC, and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Mammary Epithelial Growth Media (MEGM, Lonza). RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed. Three separate cDNA reactions were performed and these were run as replicates.
