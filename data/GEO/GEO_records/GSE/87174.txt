TITLE
Genome-wide expression patterns of microRNAs in ground state embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We apply deep small-RNA sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of microRNAs in ground state embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We provide global expression signatures of microRNAs in ESCs cultured under serum, 2i, and R2i conditions. We report that microRNAs are significantly differentially expressed when ESCs are cultured under different conditions, and that ground state pluripotency features a uniqure microRNA signature which is mainly encoded by microRNA-coding sequences within the developmentally important DLK1-Dio3 locus. Finally, we indicate that microRNA upregulated in ground state pluripotent cells (i.e. 2i/R2i) contribute to the maintenace of ground state pluripotency through stimulating self-renewal and inhibiting multi-lineague differentiation.

DESIGN
Comprehensive expression analysis of microRNAs in serum, 2i, and R2i mouse ESCs using small RNA sequencing.
