TITLE
Dynamic interplay between the transcriptome and methylome in response to oxidative and alkylating stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methyl radicals are not able to form 5'methylcytosine directly. However, tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced responses in the transcriptome are partly regulated by the methylome to restore normal cellular function

DESIGN
Cells were exposed to tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBH, Sigma) at a concentrations of 200 ÂµM for 1, 8 and 24 hours
