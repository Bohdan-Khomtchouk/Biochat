TITLE
Streptomyces griseus transcriptome analysis in delta sigD, encoding an ECF-sigma factor

ORGANISM
Streptomyces griseus

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by SigD, transcriptome profiles between wild type strain and sigD mutant with pI486-sigD, in which sigD level is low compared to wild type strain, were analyzed.
