TITLE
RNA-sequencing of tamoxifen resistant LY2 cells transfected with siRNA-HOXC11.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the global effects of HOXC11 in endocrine resistant breast cancer cells we performed RNA-seq on LY2 cells which were transfected with either siRNA targeting HOXC11 (siHOXC11) or a scrambled negative control siRNA (scrHOXC11) in the presence of 4-OH-tamoxifen (10-8M).  Knockdown was verified by Taq-man qRT-PCR prior to library preparation.  RNA (10µg) was extracted using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s instructions (n=4). RNA was reverse transcribed followed by mRNA library preparation and sequencing based on a protocol outlined by Wilhelm et al., 2010.  Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAII) (54 million reads per sample on average).

DESIGN
Silencing of HOXC11 in tamoxifen resistant LY2 cells to identify putative HOXC11 target genes.
