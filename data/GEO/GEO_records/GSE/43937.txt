TITLE
Global gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type Columbia-0 and mutant er-105 in responses to 40℃ treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global warming seriously threats world food supply.  However, very few approaches have succeeded in genetically enhancing crop heat tolerance without growth penalty. To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of Erecta action in response to thermal stress, we performed transcriptional profiling of Col-0 and mutant er-105 plants with or without 40℃ heat treatment on a global scale using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip.

DESIGN
15-20 rosette leaves of 2-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana wild type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and mutant er-105 plants grown at 21℃ (control) or treated at 40℃ for 6h were harvested immediately after heat treatment and stored in liquid nitrogen. Three biological repeats were performed on Columbia-0 (wild-type, Col-0) and er-105 (mutant) with or without 40℃ heat treatment, respectively.
