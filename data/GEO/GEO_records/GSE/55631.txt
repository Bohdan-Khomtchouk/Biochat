TITLE
Genome-wide prediction of genes targeted by titrated levels of miR-17~92

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The miR-17-92 cluster targets mRNAs involved in distinct pathways which either promote or inhibit tumor progression. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying miR-17~92 cluster mediated pro- or anti- tumorigenic effects has not been studied. In this study, we found that inhibition of colon cancer progression is dictated by quantitatively controlling expression of the miR-17~92 cluster. To identify molecular mechanisms giving rise to the different growth/metastasis patterns, we profiled gene expression in miR-Ctrl, miR-17~92Med and miR-17~92Hi cells using Affymetrix Murine GeneST Arrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA from miR-Ctrl, miR-17~92Med and miR-17~92Hi cells (3 subclones of each group) was isolated and subsequently processed for microarray hybridization using Affymetrix.
