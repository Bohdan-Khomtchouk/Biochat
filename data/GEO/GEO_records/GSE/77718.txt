TITLE
Genome-wide methylation analysis identifies core set of hypermethylated genes in CIMP-H colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation was analysed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 Beadchip in 94 matched tissue pairs of colorectal cancer patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 192 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
