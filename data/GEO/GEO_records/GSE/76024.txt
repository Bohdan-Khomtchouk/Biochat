TITLE
To study global expression profile of adult zebrafish in response to arsenic trioxide

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Present experinment depicts the global gene expression profile of adult zebrafish to understand the conserved molecular snapshot beyond dose dependency and tissue specificity. The data provides ample insight of changes in gene expression leading to arsenic toxicity in vivo. Several aspects of arsenic toxicity are further validated by qPCR.

DESIGN
Agilent Custom Zebra fish 8x60k Gene Expression  (AMADID: 64074) designed by Genotypic Technology Private Limited, Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442). Arsenic induced gene expression was mesured in control and exposed (20ppb, 40ppb, 80ppb) zebrafish. Assay were perfomed with thecnical duplicate. Each replicate comprices of pooled RNA from three different individuals chosen randomly.
