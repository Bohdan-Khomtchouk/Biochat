TITLE
Human CD34-derived erythroid progenitors treated with BCL11A siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) that persists into adulthood affect the severity of sickle cell disease and the beta-thalassemia syndromes. Genetic association studies have identified sequence variants in the gene BCL11A that influence HbF levels. Here we examine BCL11A as a potential regulator of HbF expression. The high HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the beta-globin gene cluster. BCL11A emerges as a therapeutic target for reactivation of HbF in beta-hemoglobin disorders. BCL11A siRNA label: B, NT siRNA label: N Keywords: cell type comparsion

DESIGN
Microarray expression analysis from CD34-derived erythroid progenitors treated with either non-targeting (NT) control siRNAs or BCL11A targeting siRNAs.  Six samples from the NT control and six samples from the BCL11A siRNA treatment are included.  Cells were harvested on day 7 of erythroid differentiation after introduction of siRNAs on day 0 of the differentiation protocol. 6 BCL11A siRNA datasets, 6 control (NT) datasets
