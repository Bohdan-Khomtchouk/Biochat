TITLE
[E-MTAB-308] Zebrafish gene 3 prime end pull down for genome annotation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
As part of the zebrafish genome annotation project the 3 prime ends of genes were pulled down on polyT beads and sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer to identify alternative 3 prime ends in a range of tissues and developmental stages. Total RNA from a range of developmental stages and adult tissues were chemically fragmented, pulled down on polyT magnetic beads and double stranded cDNA was synthesized. The cDNA was BpmI digested to release from the beads and to leave a 6 T base tail. Illumina sequencing libraries were made followed by 76 base paired-end sequencing.
