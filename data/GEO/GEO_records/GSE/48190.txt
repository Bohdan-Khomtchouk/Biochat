TITLE
Affymetrix_SNP6_Allelotyping

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of Genotyping using pooled DNA samples (Allelotyping) and Individual Genotyping using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 In this study, data from 100 DNA samples individually genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 were used to estimate the error of the pooling approach by comparing the results with those obtained using the same array type but DNA pools each composed of 50 of the same samples. Newly developed and established methods for signal intensity correction were applied. Furthermore, the relative allele intensity signals (RAS) obtained by allelotyping were compared to the corresponding values derived from individual genotyping. Similarly, differences in RAS values between pools were determined and compared.

DESIGN
2 disjunct DNA pools each composed of 50 samples, incl. one technical replicate each.
