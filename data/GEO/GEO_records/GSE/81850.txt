TITLE
Bioengineered tumoral microtissues recapitulate desmoplastic reaction of pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work, we reported a strategy to produce 3D in vitro microtissues of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for studying the desmoplastic reaction activated by the stroma-cancer crosstalk. The purpose of this dataset was to examine the transcriptional expression changes of normal fibroblasts (NF), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (PT45) in 3D versus 2D culture and in mono-culture versus co-culture. Illumina Human BeadChips were used to profile the transcriptome after 12 days of culture. We reported that human PDAC microtissues, obtained by co-culturing PT45 with NF or CAF within biodegradable microcarriers in spinner flask bioreactor, closely recapitulate key PDAC microenvironment characteristics.

DESIGN
Normal fibroblasts (NF), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (PT45) cultured in 2D or 3D conditions for 12 days, in mono- or co-cultures.
