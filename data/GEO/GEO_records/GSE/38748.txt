TITLE
Fcp1 dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain required for efficient transcription of heat shock genes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA polymerase II is decreased on heat shock-induced genes when the CTD phosphatase Fcp1 is knocked down in Drosophila S2 cells. We examined transcriptionally-engaged Pol II genome-wide with GRO-seq to determine if other genes are similarly affected.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of nascent RNA sequencing
