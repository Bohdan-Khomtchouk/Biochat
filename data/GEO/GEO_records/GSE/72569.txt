TITLE
Effects of residual metals contained in single-wall carbon nanotubes on cellular response in rat alveolar macrophages and human alveolar epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) and human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) exposure to iron-enriched pristine single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or their purified SWCNTs were employed to gain insights at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Two kinds of singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), CNT-1 or CNT-2 induced gene expression in rat alveolar macrophages and human alveolar epithelial cell line were measured at 24 hours exposure to doses of 0.1mg/mL. The experiments were performed using control for each experiment (n=4).
