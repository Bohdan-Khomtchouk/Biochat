TITLE
Expression data from RNAi knockdown HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One day before transfection, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (1.5 x 10e5 cells per well) or 10-cm culture dishes (4.3 x 10e5 cells per dish). siRNA duplex (at a final concentration in culture medium of 30 nM) was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA duplices specific for human hnRNP L, human hnRNP LL, and luciferase GL2 were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Keywords: control / knockdown comparison
