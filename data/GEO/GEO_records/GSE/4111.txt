TITLE
Expression profiling of five different xenobiotics using a C. elegans microarray

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Using a C. elegans whole genome DNA microarray in this study, the effects of five different xenobiotics on the gene expression of the nematode were investigated. The exposure time for the following five applied compounds beta-NF (5 mg/l), Fla (0.5 mg/l), atrazine (25 mg/l), clofibrate (10 mg/l) and DES (0.5 mg/l) was 48+/-5 h. The analysis of the data showed a clear induction of 203 genes belonging to different families like the cytochromes P450, UDP-glucoronosyltransferases (UDPGT), glutathione S-transferases (GST), carboxylesterases, collagenes, C-type lectins and others. Under the applied conditions, fluoranthene was able to induce most of the induceable genes, followed by clofibrate, atrazine, beta-naphthoflavone and diethylstilbestrol. A decreased expression could be shown for 153 genes with atrazine having the strongest effect followed by fluoranthene, diethylstilbestrol, beta-naphthoflavone and clofibrate. For upregulated genes a change ranging from approximately 2.1- till 42.3-fold and for downregulated genes from approximately 2.1 till 6.6-fold of gene expression could be affected through the applied xenobiotics.  Sample Treatments (by exptids) Clofibrate: 14317, 16443, 16505 Fluoranthene: 33664, 33667, 33669, 23484 beta-Naphthoflavone: 6844, 14320, 14316 Atrazin: 33672, 33674, 23487, 23486 DES: 33671, 23485 A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed.
