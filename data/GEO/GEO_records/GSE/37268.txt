TITLE
Genome wide mapping of histone acetyltransferase MOF binding in murine ES cells (sequencing)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of illumina sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone acetyltransferase Mof in mouse embryonic stem cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that Mof widely binds to mouse genome and mark genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed. Mof binds to both gene promoters and coding regions, exhibiting two modes of binding. This study provides a framework for understanding the function of Mof in regulating ESC core transcription network.

DESIGN
Examination of Mof binding patterns in ES cells
