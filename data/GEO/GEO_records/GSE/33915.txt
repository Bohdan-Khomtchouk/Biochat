TITLE
Microarray identification of conserved microRNAs in Pinellia pedatisecta

ORGANISM
Pinellia pedatisecta

SUMMARY
An in situ synthesized custom miRNA microarray was employed to detect miRNAs from P. pedatisecta, A total of 99 miRNAs belonging to 22 miRNA families were identified.

DESIGN
in the study present here, the microarray design was based on 2521 well-characterized miRNAs from 43 plant species  on Sanger miRBase Release 16, and  Eighteen 5S rRNAs that served as internal reference were chosen from A. thaliana, C. reticulata, and O. sativa with an equal amount. Eight quality control probes were synthesized to perfect match (PM) or one nucleotide mismatch (MM) with eight external spiked-in synthetic RNA (20mer).
