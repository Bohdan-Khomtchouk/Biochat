TITLE
Genome-wide effect of cholera toxin and nitrate treatment in etiolated rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The present study used microarray approach to identify the genomewide response to cholera toxin in the presence of nitrate. Considering that fact that the possibility of the existence of multiple Gα genes/proteins in plants has not been conclusively ruled out, analysis of the genomewide impact of RGA1 mutation in rice and GPA1 mutation in Arabidopsis reveal only those genes that are under their direct control. On the other hand, assuming that all those different Gα subunits in any given plant are regulated by cholera toxin, analysis of the genomwide response to cholera toxin could capture the entire G-protein responsive transcriptome, beyond what can be revealed by the mutant approach. This could reveal even those genes that respond to other, as yet unidentified Gα subunits, as well as reveal some genes that are non-specifically regulated by cholera toxin, independent of any G-proteins.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 10 day old excised rice leaves treated with or without cholera toxin in the presence of nitrate.Total RNA was first converted into cDNA and then into cRNA labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. These were hybridized on the 44K 60-mer whole genome arrays on glass slides. The slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent scanner (G2565B) at 100 %  laser power. Data extraction was carried out with Agilent Feature Exiraction software (version 9.1). The experiment was repeated with a biological-cum-technical replicate where total RNA samples were isolated from a fresh batch of rice plants and the cRNAs were labeled with opposite dyes (dye-swap).
