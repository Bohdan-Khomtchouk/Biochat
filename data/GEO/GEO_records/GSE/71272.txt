TITLE
Paracrine effects of estrogen on 231BR cells, through ER+ astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which paracrine action of 17-beta-estradiol on ER+ mouse astrocytes, affect gene expression of MDA231-derived brain trophic 231BR cells.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed in triplicate samples from 231BR cells treated with vehicle (OH), 10nM Estradiol (E2), alone or in combination with mouse astrocytes.  231BR-EGFP cells were sorted after 24h co-culture.
