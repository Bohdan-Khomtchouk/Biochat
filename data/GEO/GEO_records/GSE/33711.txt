TITLE
Gene expression in liver, gill, hypothalamus, pituitary, and olfactory rosettes from Atlantic salmon parr and smolt

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in the developmental process of Atlantic salmon smoltification, gene expression was compared between smolt and parr in tissues involved in osmoregulation  (gill), metabolism (liver), imprinting (olfactory rosettes) and neuroendocrine control (hypothalamus and pituitary).  Tissue samples were harvested from laboratory-reared parr and smolts on the same date.  Smolts were distinguished from parr by size and appearance; developmental status was confirmed by physiological assays.
