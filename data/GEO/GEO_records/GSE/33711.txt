TITLE
Gene expression in liver, gill, hypothalamus, pituitary, and olfactory rosettes from Atlantic salmon parr and smolt

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in the developmental process of Atlantic salmon smoltification, gene expression was compared between smolt and parr in tissues involved in osmoregulation  (gill), metabolism (liver), imprinting (olfactory rosettes) and neuroendocrine control (hypothalamus and pituitary).  Tissue samples were harvested from laboratory-reared parr and smolts on the same date.  Smolts were distinguished from parr by size and appearance; developmental status was confirmed by physiological assays.

DESIGN
Eight biological replicates (16 fish) balanced for sex and for dye were used in the liver, gill, olfactory rosette, and hypothalamus comparisons. Four male parr were compared to four male smolts and four female parr were compared to four female smolts; smolts were labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 on four arrays and with Alexa Fluor 647 on four arrays.   Six biological replicates (12 fish) were used for the pituitary comparison (two female and four male).
