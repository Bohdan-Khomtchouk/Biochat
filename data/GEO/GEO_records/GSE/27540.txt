TITLE
MMTV tumor and host cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MMTV Wnt-1 and MMTV-Her2 tumors are transplanted onto GFP transgenic mice. Separate GFP+ cells and GFP- cells by FACS sorting to see the oncogene dependent gene expression changes in both tumor cell compartment (GFP- cells). Wnt Fzd 6hrs group: Wnt inhibitor (Fzd8-CRD) treated tumor RNA which will give some clue for direct Wnt target genes only in tumor cells.

DESIGN
GFP- Tumor cells (4 biological replicates) and Wnt-inhibitor treated cells (5 biological replicates)

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
