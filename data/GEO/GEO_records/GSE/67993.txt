TITLE
Analysis of SOX2 downregulation under self-renewal conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SXO2 is one of the factors involved in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency in hESCs. This study was performed to reveal the effects of reduced SOX2 levels in self-renewing pluripotent hESCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated wildtype hESCs and SOX2 siRNA transfected hESCs after 48 hours of plating.
