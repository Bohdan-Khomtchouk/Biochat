TITLE
MyoD is a tumor suppressor gene in Medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While medulloblastoma, a pediatric tumor of the cerebellum, is characterized by aberrations in developmental pathways, the majority of genetic determinants remain unknown.  An unbiased Sleeping Beauty transposon screen revealed MyoD as a putative medulloblastoma tumor suppressor.  This was unexpected, as MyoD is a muscle differentiation factor and not previously known to be expressed in cerebellum or medulloblastoma.  In response to deletion of one allele of MyoD, two other Sonic hedgehog-driven mouse medulloblastoma models showed accelerated tumor formation and death, confirming MyoD as a tumor suppressor in these models.  In normal cerebellum, MyoD was expressed in the proliferating granule neuron progenitors that are thought to be precursors to medulloblastoma.  Similar to some other tumor suppressors that are induced in cancer, MyoD was expressed in proliferating medulloblastoma cells in three mouse models and in human medulloblastoma cases.  This suggests that although expression of MyoD in a proliferating tumor is insufficient to prevent tumor progression, its expression in the cerebellum hinders medulloblastoma genesis.

DESIGN
The goal of the gene expression analysis was to determine whether the canonical myogenic differentiation program was involved in increased tumorigenicity following loss of MyoD in the SHH-driven mouse models of medulloblastoma. We compared MyoD+/+; SmoA2 (n=3) with MyoD+/- ;SmoA2 mouse medulloblastoma tumors (n=2).
