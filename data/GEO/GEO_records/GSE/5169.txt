TITLE
Temperature induced differentiation of piA immortalised cell line PrE2.8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cell line PrE2.8 was cultured at a permissive growth temperature of 33oC and then half transferred to a non-permissive temperature of 39.5oC for 4days. The two sets of cells were harvested and co-hybridised to identify genes with altered expression  resulting from unduced differentiation. Keywords: Induction of cellular differentiation

DESIGN
Cells were harvested from cultures grown at two temperatures and RNA isolated. RNA from induced and non induced cultures were co-hybridised onto array slides.
