TITLE
Gene expression of thymic settling progenitors from embryos at E13 compared to E18

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used whole genome transcriptome as gene discovery to further understand the differential behaviour of the first (embryonic) and second waves of thymic settling progenitors in the murine embryo.

DESIGN
Mouse embryos at days 13 and 18 of gestation were isolated and the thymic lobes were dissected. Single cell suspension was prepared and treated with biotinilated antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, TER119, Gr1, CD25, CD19, NK1.1 and CD11c. Cell suspensions were then incubated with streptavidin Miltenyi Macs beads. Lineage negative thymocytes were recovered in Macs columns. Cell suspensions were then incubated with antibodies against CD135, CD117, CD44, CD24 and Streptavidin bound to PECy7. Lin-, CD117+, CD44+, CD24low, CD135+ cells were then isolated by cell sorting. 3 biological replicates of each sample were isolated with 104-3x104 cells
