TITLE
ume6D_BY4741 on expression/splicing microarrays

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ume6D_BY4741 vegetative RNA compared to WT_BY4741 vegetative RNA. ume6D haploid was generated in the BY4741 strain background (ATCC: 201388) by PCR-mediated cassette-based gene replacement where the UME6 ORF was replaced with KANMX6, the deletion was verified by PCR.

DESIGN
Vegetatively grown; Dye swap; Reference vegetative WT_BY4741
