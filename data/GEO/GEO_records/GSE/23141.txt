TITLE
Evaluation of the Affymetrix Brassica Exon 1.0 ST array

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the performance of the Affymetrix Brassica Exon 1.0 ST array. Root and leaf samples from Brassica rapa line R-O-18 were compared. The same RNA samples were hybridised to the Agilent Brassica array, to compare the performance of the two arrays.

DESIGN
6 samples were hybridised to each array. Triplicate samples of 11-day-old roots and 2 semi-expanded leaves from 23-day-old Brassica rapoa R-O-18 plants.
