TITLE
Female and Male Mice from the MRL/lpr and Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) Strains.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Effect of Sex on Lacrimal Gland Gene Expression in the MRL/lpr and Non-obese Diabetic Mouse Models of SjšgrenÕs Syndrome Keywords: Female vs Male Lacrimal Gland Gene Expression.

DESIGN
Female and male lacrimal glands were harvested each mouse strain . Tissues were pooled into 3 biological replicates and were hybridized to separate microarrays.  Each cRNA prep was hybridized to a GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLink UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray and a Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Array 430A.

PLATFORM
GPL2894 GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences CodeLink™   UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
