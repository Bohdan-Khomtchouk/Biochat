TITLE
Effect of PRR15 knockdown on human trophoblast cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proline rich 15 (PRR15) is a small nuclear protein required for normal conceptus development in the sheep. We used microarrays to assess the changes in the trophoblast transcriptome when PRR15 expression was diminished.

DESIGN
The human first-trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, was infected with control lentivirus expressing no shRNA or lentivirus expressing shRNA to target PRR15 mRNA for degradation, with three biological replicates per treatment.
