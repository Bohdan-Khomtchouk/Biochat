TITLE
Genome-wide changes in the circadian transcriptional program in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
Circadian input kinas A (cikA) null cells severly distorts the genome-wide output of the circadian clock

DESIGN
Synechococcus cultures (both wildtype and Î”cikA null cells) were synchronized with two light-dark (12h:12h) cycle before release into continuous light. Samples were collected at 4 h intervals for the next 24 h, total RNA was isolated from samples collected at each time points and genome-wide expression was measured using custom-designed microarrays
