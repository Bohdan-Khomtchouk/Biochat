TITLE
Comparative analysis of D. shibae wild-type vs. delta-luxI1 supplemented with different acetylated homoserine-lactones

ORGANISM
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493

SUMMARY
Comparison of a quorum sensing null mutant supplemented with C18-HSL, C18en-HSL, C18dien-HSL with D. shibae wild-type in order to identify traits induced by distinct autoinducers in this organism.

DESIGN
Loop-design, two to three biological replicates of D. shibae wild-type, delta-luxI1 and delta-luxI1 supplemented with 500 nM C18-HSL, C18en-HSL and C18dien-HSL at cultivation start. Samples were taken in mid-exponential growth phase at OD600 0.4
