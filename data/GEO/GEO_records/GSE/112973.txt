TITLE
Molecular subtype-specific immunocompetent models of high-grade urothelial carcinoma reveal differential neoantigen expression and response to immunotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a UPPL (Upk3a-CreERT2;p53f/f;Ptenf/f;Rosa26LSL-Luc) mouse model of bladder cancer and compared it with the existing BBN (N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine) mouse model of blader cancer. We cultured UPPL and BBN primary tumor cells as cell lines along with MB49 cancer cell lines and KT immortalized normal urothelial cell lines and implanted them back into mice as cell-line derived tumors.

DESIGN
RNASeq analysis was performed on 9 UPPL primary tumors, 11 BBN primary tumors, 1 UPPL cell line, 1 BBN cell line, 1 MB49 cell line, 3 KT cell lines, 4 UPPL cell-line derived tumors, 2 BBN cell-line derived tumors, and 4 MB49 cell-line derived tumors

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
