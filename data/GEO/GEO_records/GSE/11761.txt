TITLE
Brief bout of exercise alters gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of early- and late-pubertal males

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared PBMC genomic response to exercise in both early (EB) and late-pubertal boys (LB) Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Twenty healthy males (age range 8-18 y/o) participated in this study. A baseline blood sample was taken before the onset of exercise and immediately after 30-min exercise bout. PBMCs were isolated using OptiPrep. Density Gradient Medium (SIGMA). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol. cRNA hybridized onto Affymetrix U133+2 arrays (total of 40 chips).
