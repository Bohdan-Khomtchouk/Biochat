TITLE
Pten signaling in fibroblasts effects gene expression in endothelial and epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments aim determine the effects of Pten signaling in fibroblasts on gene expression in other cell compartments in the mammary gland.

DESIGN
To achieve this, we used a genetic model in which the tumor suppressor gene Pten was specifically inactivated in stromal fibroblats.  We then isolated fibroblasts, epithelial cells and endothelial cells from the mammary glands of mice with either wild type or Pten null fibroblasts.  Comparisons were made between wild type and Pten counterparts, not between the various cell types.
