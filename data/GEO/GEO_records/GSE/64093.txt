TITLE
Expression analysis of Human esophagus cancer cell line TE-1 transfected with PCDNA3.1 and PCDNA3.1-Pax2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes of  TE-1 transfected with PCDNA3.1-Pax2 ,compared to TE-1 transfected with PCDNA3.1.

DESIGN
Compare PAX2 activated genes by analyzing mRNA profilings between pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-PAX2- transfected TE-1 cells.
