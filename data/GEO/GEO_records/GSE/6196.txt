TITLE
Mouse Reissner's Membrane Gene Expression studies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to screen for the expressed genes in Reissner's membrane (RM) that are related to ion transport and its regulation.  The objectives were 1) to determine whether short-term incubation altered the transcriptome and 2 ) to discover which genes changed expression levels in response to glucocorticoids. Keywords: drug response

DESIGN
RM was dissected free-hand from mouse cochleae and either immediately subjected to RNA extraction or incubated for 24 as explants.  Two series of samples were incubated in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (100 nM) and samples of RM were pooled to obtain sufficient material for gene array analysis.  The pooled samples were used to hybridize 3 gene array chips for each biological sample.
