TITLE
Vitrification alters fetal development by profound differences during fetal placenta formation

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Vitrification is replacing slow freezing as the most popular method for human embryo cryopreservation in clinics world-wide. Several studies demonstrated that cryopreservation alters gene expression of mammalian embryos, but none of them analysed what happen with those embryos that get implanted and follow with the gestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitrification technique on rabbit embryonic and fetal development by performing a transcriptomic analysis of 6 day old embryos and 14 days old fetal placentas.

DESIGN
Effect of vitrification on late blastocyst and fetal placenta transcriptome. Four indepent replicates were performed for each condition (control and vitrified) and for both tissues (embryo and fetal placenta).
