TITLE
STAT6-regulated genes in mouse B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The IL-4-induced and STAT6-dependent gene expression profile in mouse B cells was analyzed. Untouched B cells from 9 weeks old female Ly5.1-congenic wild-type and Ly5.2-congenic STAT6-deficient mice, both on BALB/c background, were isolated from the spleen and stimulated for 4 days in vitro with LPS and anti-CD40 in the presence or absence of IL-4.

DESIGN
There are 12 samples in total. Triplicates for the following conditions were analyzed: wild-type without IL-4 (WT_contr), STAT6-deficient without IL-4 (STAT6_contr), wild-type with IL-4 (WT_IL-4) and STAT6-deficient with IL-4 (STAT6_IL-4).
