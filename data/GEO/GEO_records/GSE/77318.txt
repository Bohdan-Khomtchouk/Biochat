TITLE
Ion Torrent RNA-sequencing of exosomes isolated from ovarian cancer cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used next-generation sequencing to identify differential microRNA (miRNA) signatures in exosomes isolated from ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and adipocytes (CAAs). We found that a significantly higher levels of miR21 isomiRNAs in exosomes isolated from CAFs and CAAs than in those from ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
Samples are exosomes isolated from four ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, HeyA8, OVCA433 and SKOV3), two normal fibroblasts, three CAFs, two normal adipocytes and two CAAs
