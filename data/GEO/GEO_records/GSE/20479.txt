TITLE
global gene expression profiles in primary human hepatocytes exposed to phytochemicals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human hepatocytes were treated with 2 non-cytotoxic concentrations of sulforaphane (SFN; 10 and 50 uM) phenethyl isothiocyante (PEITC; 10 and 25 uM), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM; 10 and 50 uM), or one concentration of oltipraz (OPZ; 30 uM) for 48 hours.  Given the considerable heterogeneity of the human population, it was essential that each experiment was performed with hepatocytes from the same liver, i.e. each liver served as its own control.   Each treatment was performed on three batches of human hepatocytes, each derived from a separate liver.

DESIGN
32 arrays, 8 experimental groups.
