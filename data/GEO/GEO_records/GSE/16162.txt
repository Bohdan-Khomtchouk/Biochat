TITLE
Differential expression of whole transcriptome in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was used for a systematic survey of differential expression with a focus on antisense (as)RNAs and non-coding (nc)RNAs. A microarray was constucted with on average 5 probes for each transcript known thus far, including ncRNAs and asRNAs. The resulting 20,431 individual probes are duplicated on the array (Agilent 4x44k custom array) representing a technical replicate. Hybridization of this array with total RNA isolated from cultures raised under different growth conditions identified transcripts from intergenic spacers and in antisense orientation to known genes (natural cis-asRNAs) with differential expression compared to control hybridizations. This shows the involvement of such transcripts in the regulation of adaptation to various stresses.

DESIGN
12 RNA hybridizations (1 control & 3 stress conditions, 3 times each)
