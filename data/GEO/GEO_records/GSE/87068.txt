TITLE
RNA Sequencing Quantitative Analysis of RNA editing sites of Wild Type and ADAR1 editing deficient (ADAR1E861A) murine fetal RNA of various tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Adar1 deaminase inactive mutant mouse tissue samples were obtain from the Walkley lab as described in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275108. We performed mmPCR-seq on the samples and measured the editing levels of.

DESIGN
Fetal mRNA profiles of E12.5 wild type (WT) and ADAR E861A mutant mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
