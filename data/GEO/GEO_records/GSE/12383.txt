TITLE
Genome wide profiling of H3K9me2 in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The objective of the study is to profile histone H3 lysine nine di-methylation (H3K9me2) in Arabidopsis thaliana and to correlate it with DNA methylation.

DESIGN
We constructed a high-resolution genome-wide map of H3K9me2 methylation by using native chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with HD2 whole genome Nimblegen microarrays. Three replicas were performed for the native ChIP. As a control, one replica of ChIP isolated from crosslinked tissue was used.
