TITLE
Genome wide localization of chromatin bound NUP98-PHF23 (NP23)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome wide localization of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and the NUP98-PHF23 (with V5 tag) fusion protein which binds H3K4me3 via its PHD finger, using ChIP-seq. Results correlated with gene expression profiles. NUP98-PHF23 bound only 1.6% of H3K4me3 marks including Hoxa/b + Meis1.

DESIGN
Assess H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks, and correlate these marks with chromatin binding of the NP23 fusion protein using lymphoblast and myeloblast cell lines derived from NP23 leukemias.
