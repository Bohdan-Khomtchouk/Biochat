TITLE
Molecular phenotyping of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTEC-TERT1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular phenotyping quantifies expression of pathway reproter genes by next-generation sequencing of pre-defined amplicons. We applied the technology to quantify pathway-level impact of ASOs to PTECs in the presence and absence of exogeneous EGF.

DESIGN
Five ASOs, each in three concentrations, and vehicle controls were added to the cell culture of PTEC-TERT1 cells either in the presence or in the absence of exogeneous EGF. Molecular phenotyping was performed 6 hours later. Three biological replicates were performed for each condition
