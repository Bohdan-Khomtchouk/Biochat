TITLE
Transcriptomic response of the auxotrophic Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) leuD mutant under environmental stresses

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis

SUMMARY
Comparing the transcriptomic responses between the Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) leuD mutant with the parent strain K-10 under different environmental stresses: nutrition, temperature, anaerobic conditions, high- and low- pH conditions.

DESIGN
MAP wild type K-10 vs. leuD mutant, 6 different treatments. Two biological replicates with two technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15269 Agilent-023741 Mparatuberculosis K10 Genome Array (Feature Number version)
