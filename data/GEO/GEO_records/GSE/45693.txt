TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional responses of two metal-tolerant symbiotic Mesorhizobium isolates to zinc and cadmium exposure

ORGANISM
Mesorhizobium metallidurans STM 2683 ; Mesorhizobium sp. STM 4661

SUMMARY
Mesorhizobium metallidurans STM 2683 and Mesorhizobium sp. strain STM 4661 were isolated from nodules of the metallicolous legume Anthyllis vulneraria from distant mining spoils. They tolerate unusually high zinc and cadmium concentrations as compared to other mesorhizobia. This work aims to study the gene expression profiles associated with zinc or cadmium exposure and to identify genes involved in metal tolerance in these two metallicolous Mesorhizobium strains of interest for mine phytostabilization purposes.

DESIGN
Mesorhizobium metallidurans STM 2683 and Mesorhizobium sp. strain STM 4661 with three treatments (control, Zn and Cd).
