TITLE
Comparing gene expression profiles of pigmented and amelanotic (MPNST-like) melanomas arising in the genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)-Cdk4(R24C) mouse melanoma model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that pigmented and amelanotic (MPNST-like) melanomas arise in the genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)-Cdk4(R24C) mouse melanoma model and even in the same animal. To explore the molecular differences between the two type of melanomas in this model  we performed global gene expression profiling and pathway analysis to compare the underlying mechanisms. This information was used to identify human melanomas that resemble each type of the mouse melanomas found in the in the genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)-Cdk4(R24C) mouse melanoma model.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from excised and liquid nitrogen frozen tumors and global gene expression was performed using the Illumina Mouse WG6 v2.0 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
