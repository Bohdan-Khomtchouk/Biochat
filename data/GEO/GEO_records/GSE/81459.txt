TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling of Brassica juncea BnCRY2aOE transgenics vis-Ã -vis wild-type

ORGANISM
Brassica juncea

SUMMARY
The BnCRY2aOE transgenics over-expressing a blue light photoreceptor (BnCRY2a) flowered earlier than wild-type plants by more than two weeks. To identify the downstream candidate genes involved in regulating the early flowering phenotype in the transgenics, a genome-wide microarray analysis of the transgenic plant vs. wild type was performed. The microarray data analysis revealed the differential up-regulation of many genes involved in flower development, cell growth and differentiation and hormone biosynthesis/signalling in comparison to wild-type.

DESIGN
The wild-type and BnCRY2aOEtransgenic plants were grown in transgenic containment facility. Fully expanded leaves were harvested from 45-d-old wild-type and transgenic plants (two biological replicates for each) for performing whole genome expression profiling using Gene Expression B. napus (Brassica) Oligo Microarray 4x44K (AMADID: 22520, Cat# G2519F_022520) Agilent platform.Overall, there were 4 samples: two for wild-type (control samples), other two for transgenics (test samples).

PLATFORM
GPL15739 Agilent-022520 Brassica napus 4x44K (Probe Name version)
