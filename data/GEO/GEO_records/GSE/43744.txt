TITLE
Comparison of Gene Expression between Peri-implant Soft Tissue and Oral Mucosal Tissue

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The mucosal penetration area formed by implant placement is critical problems of dental implant treatment, because epithelial barrier is broken and it can become a source of inflammation. To clarify the influence and risk caused by dental implant treatment in peri-implant soft tissue, we compared to gene expression profile of peri-implant soft tissue and oral mucosal tissue with microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Both side upper first molars of 4 week-old rat were extracted, and titanium alloy implants were placed only in the left extraction socket. Four weeks after surgery, samples were harvested from left side of peri-implant soft tissue and right side of oral mucosal tissue.
