TITLE
KRAB/KAP1-microRNA cascade regulates erythropoiesis through the stage-specific control of mitophagy [Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A multilayered transcription regulatory system is unveiled, where protein- and RNA-based repressors are super-imposed in combinatorial fashion to govern the timely triggering of an essential step of erythropoiesis

DESIGN
Analyses of transcriptional profiles and chromatin state in KAP1 WT and KO (or KD)  cells

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus) GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
