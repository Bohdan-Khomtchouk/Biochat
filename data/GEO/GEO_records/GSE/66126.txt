TITLE
The p53 Target Gene Siva Enables Tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Siva is a p53target gene essential for p53-dependent apoptosis, although it can also promote proliferation through inhibition of p53 in some settings. Thus, the role of Siva in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Surprisingly, we find that Siva loss inhibits non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, suggesting that Siva facilitates tumorigenesis. Similarly, Siva knockdown in mouse and human NSCLC cell lines decreases proliferation and transformation. To gain an understanding of the molecular basis for the reduced proliferation and transformation resulting from Siva knockdown, we performed gene expression profiling experiments on LSZ4 and LSZ2 cells after Siva knockdown by lentiviral transduction with each of the two previously characterized shRNAs (shSiva1 and shSiva2) and each of two control shRNAs (shLacZ and shGFP). Hierarchical clustering revealed a notable difference in gene expression profiles between Siva knockdown and control samples. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) terms using GeneSpring Analysis. We found that the most enriched GO terms included immune regulation – consistent with Siva’s known role in regulating NFкB signaling – as well as cell migration and metabolic processes.

DESIGN
RNA from LSZ2 and LSZ4 non small cell lung cancer cells expressing control (shGFP1, shLacz) or Siva (shSiva1, shSiva2) hairpins was used.  A total of seven control samples and eight test samples using different cell lines and hairpins were used.
