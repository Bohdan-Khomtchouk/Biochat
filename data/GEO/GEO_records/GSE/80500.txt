TITLE
Effect of Glycyrrhetinic acid and its derivatives on antibacterial activity and virulence against Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MW2

SUMMARY
To clarify the mechanism for the antibacterial activity of GR-SU, we performed the DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus was measured at 2 hours after exposure to 128Î¼g/ml of GR-SU.  Four independent experiments were performed using different samples for each experiment.
