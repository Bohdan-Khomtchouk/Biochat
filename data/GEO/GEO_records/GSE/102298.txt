TITLE
Regulation of autophagy, NF-kB signaling and cell viability by miR-124 in KRAS mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of microRNA expression profiles in human KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) derived cell lines based on differential KRAS dependency and epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation characteristics.

DESIGN
TLDA qPCR assays were performed on reverse-transcribed total RNA from 3 KRAS independent cell lines (mesenchymal/KM) and 3 KRAS dependent (epithelial/KE) cell lines.
