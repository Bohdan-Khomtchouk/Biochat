TITLE
Global gene expression analysis reveals importance of thermal effect in cellular response to millimeter wave exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect of millimeter waves (MMW) exposure on the gene expression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. Neonatal primary Keratinocyte cells pooled from 3 healthy donors were exposed ex vivo, 3 hours at 20 mW/cm². At this condition, corresponding to the maximum power density authorized for public use, MMW exposure induces a significant increase of the temperature and 665 genes were found differentially expressed. To determine the role of hyperthermia in this response, several controls were performed. When the temperature artificially maintained constant, no specific gene modifications were observed after exposure. However, a heat shock control did not mimic exactly the MMW effect: 34-gene signatures were identified between 20 mW/cm2 MMW exposure and its relative heat shock control. Differential expression of seven genes (ADAMTS6, NOG, IL7R, FADD, JUNB, SNAI2 and HIST1H1A) from this signature were confirmed by duplication of the whole experiment and real-time PCR analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression in human keratinocytes was measured after a 60 GHz-exposure at 20 mW/cm2, for 3 h (Expo). It was compared to cells cultured in unexposed condition (Sham). As millimeter wave (MMW) exposure increase temperature in the cell medium, two controls were performed: 1) MMW exposure (3 h, 60 GHz, 20 mW/cm²) with the heat increase compensated to maintain constant the physiological temperature (CompT_Expo); 2) Heat shock control (HSC) to mimicking the heat effect of MMW exposure.
