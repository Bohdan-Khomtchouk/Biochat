TITLE
miRNAs profile of goose normal liver and fatty liver

ORGANISM
Anser anser

SUMMARY
We identified the differentially expressed miRNAs in Landes goose liver after overfeeding for 21 days using high-throughput sequencing. We obtained 21453493 and 21525819 clean reads in normal liver and fatty liver by high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Of these clean reads, we respectively gained 9244896 and 9847086 miRNAs sequences in two groups by filtering the known non-miRNA reads, such as rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA by screening against ncRNA deposited in the GenBank and Rfam databases. These findings provided insights into the expression profiles of miRNAs in goose liver, and deepened our understanding of miRNAs in hepatic steatosis of geese.

DESIGN
Examination of miRNAs expression profile in normal and fatty liver samples
