TITLE
Genetic basis of transcriptome diversity in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This project uses pooled poly A (+) RNA from the DGRP to derive transcript models specific to DGRP. The derived transcript models provide the basis for quantifying gene expression in the DGRP lines using genome tiling arrays.

DESIGN
Pooled whole body poly A (+) RNA for females and males of the DGRP lines were barcoded, multiplexed, and sequenced on a single HiSeq 2000 lane using 100PE sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
