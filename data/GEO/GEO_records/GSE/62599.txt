TITLE
Protein Microarrays Identify Disease Specific Anti-Cytokine Autoantibody Profiles in Immunodeficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
57 serum samples from immunodeficiency patients were screened on custom designed protein microarrays for the presence of autoantibodies against cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and other candidate autoantigens.

DESIGN
One hundred four purified biomolecules including known autoantigens, as well as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and receptors were printed on the arrays. All targets were printed in triplicate. Arrays were probed with diluted serum and autoantibodies were detected with a Cy5 conjugated anti-human IgG secondary.
