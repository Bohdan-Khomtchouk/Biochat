TITLE
Human Subperitoneal Fibroblasts and Cancer Cell Interaction Creates Microenvironment Enhancing Tumor Progression and Metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts isolated from human colon submucosal and subperitoneal layer were stimulated by colon cancer cell line (DLD-1) cultured medium. Peritoneal invasion in colon cancer is an important prognostic factor, and the fibrosis with Î±-SMA was a significant pathological feature of the cancer microenvironment formed by peritoneal invasion (CMPI). The result indicated that the gene expression of subperitoneal fibroblasts showed more various gene modification than submucosal fibroblasts. And ACTA2 expression was higher in fibroblasts from subperitoneal layer than that from submucosal layer. Together with this concordant stromal protein expression in CMPI, this in vitro model is able to reflect the special microenvironment in CMPI.

DESIGN
3 cases of human colon submucosal and subperitoneal fibroblasts were isolated, and these fibroblasts were stimulated with DLD-1 cultured medium. Total RNA were extracted from these samples and hybridized in Affymetrix microarray to compare their gene expression changes through the DLD-1 stimulation
