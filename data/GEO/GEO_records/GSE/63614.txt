TITLE
Expression and Prognostic impact of LncRNAs in AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides located within the intergenic stretches or overlapping antisense transcripts of protein coding genes. LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis and cell-cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged â‰¥60 years) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform.

DESIGN
We analyzed 148 older cytogenetically normal(CN)-AML patients samples using a custom microarray platform and describe the expression of lncRNAs among the AML samples.
