TITLE
Expression profile of human HepG2 cells treated with PADMA28 ethanolic extracts or EtOH solvent control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of PADMA28 ethanolic extracts on HepG2 gene expression. PADMA28 (Swissmedic Nr. 58436) is an Indo-Tibetan polyherbal preparation used for the treatment of symptoms associated with circulatory disorders.

DESIGN
Triplicate cultures of HepG2 cells were treated with either PADMA28 or EtOH solvent control for 18 hours. After cell harvest, the triplicates were pooled and total RNA was extracted. The RNA was analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (one array per treatment).
