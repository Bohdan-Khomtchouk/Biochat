TITLE
Expression data from a Tbx1 gene allelic series

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was aimed at identifying Tbx1 dosage-dependent genes in vivo, so we performed a transcriptome analysis of Tbx1 mutants with nine different genotypes corresponding to different Tbx1 mRNA dosages.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from whole E9.5 embryos with 9 different genotypes was hibridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. For each genotype, we used two embryos (biological replicates), each hybridized to one array, thus we analyzed a total of 18 arrays. Tbx1 gene dosage
