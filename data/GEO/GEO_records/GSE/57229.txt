TITLE
Whole genome SNP array data from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With the whole genome SNP array information obtained from tumor and matched normal control, we could evaluate the acquired copy number variations (CNVs) and uniparental disomies (UPDs) . Seven MDS patients in a whole genome sequencing project were included in this experiment.

DESIGN
To detect acquired CNVs and UPDs in MDS patients, we genotyped both CD34+ cell from bone marrow and matched skin tissue.
