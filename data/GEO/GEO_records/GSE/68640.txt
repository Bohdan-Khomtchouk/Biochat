TITLE
Expression data from leaf tissues of 35S:AtHMA4 and wild-type tomato plants grown in the presence of Zn

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis HMA4 transformation facilitates Zn root-to-shoot translocation, but in Zn-supply dependent manner. It implies that distinct effects of HMA4 expression on Zn root:shoot distribution in transgenics grown under different Zn supply regimes results from the interaction between the transgene activity and the molecular background of the host plant. Microarray analysis was performed to compare expression profiles in leaves of transgenic and WT-plants grown in the presence of 5 µM Zn to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the difference in Zn root:shoot distribution between 35S:AtHMA4-expressing and wild-type tomato. To recognize tissue specific alterations in gene transcription in tomato leaves invoked by AtHMA4 expression, spongy paerenchyma + lower epidermis and palisade paerenchyma + upper epidermis were isolated using LCM technique. Understanding the interplay between the transgene and the endogens is crucial for planning genetic modification for Zn-biofortification purpose.

DESIGN
10-day old tomato plant (35S:AtHMA4 expressing and WT) were subjected to 5 µM Zn (added as ZnSo4) for 15 days. Three independent experiments were performed. At the end of each experiment the 3rd and 4th leaf (counting upwards) were collected, 1-2 mm long and 2-3 mm wide fragments were cut out from between the vascular bundles in the middle part of each leaf, embedded in NEG-50 Frozen Section Medium (Thermo Scientific), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA isolated from three batches of leaves was amplified and used for three independent microarray analysis.
