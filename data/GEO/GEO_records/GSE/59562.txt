TITLE
Gene expression data of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant aladin

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The ALADIN protein is a component of the nuclear pore complex in higher eukaryotes. Alteration in ALADIN is the basis for the human disease called triple A syndrome (Achalasia-Addisonianism-Alacrima Syndrome). A recent report showed that ALADIN deficiency decreases the tolerance to oxidative stress in human cells and impairs their ability to proliferate. An ALADIN homologue exists in plants, but its functions are still unknown. Therefore, the role of ALADIN was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana in link with the regulation of the cell cycle. Transcriptome profiling of the roots and shoots of the aladin mutant showed the induction of numerous transcripts linked to stress response and hormone signalling.

DESIGN
Roots and shoots from the aladin mutant and the respective wild type ecotype: Wassilewskija-4 were harvested separatly in triplicates, amounting for a total of 12 samples. RNA was extracted and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix Arabidopsis Gene 1.0 ST Array.
