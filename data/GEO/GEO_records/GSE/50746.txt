TITLE
Time dependent changes of gene expression in surgical specimen of colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate time-dependent changes the comprehensive gene expressions in colorectal normal and tumor surgical specimen within two hours.

DESIGN
Both normal and tumor tissues were extracted at 0, 30, 60, 120 min after surgical removal in seven patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer and stabilized. RNA was extracted and calculated, time dependent changes of gene expression were examined by microarray data.
