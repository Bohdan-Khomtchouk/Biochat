TITLE
Pre- and Post-hatch transcriptomic response of chicken Musculus pectoralis major to transient variation of incubation temperature

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
After elevated and reduced incubation temperature during embryonic days (ED) 7-10 and 10-13 changes of gene expression were determined  at ED 10, ED 13, and post-hatch at day (D) 35

DESIGN
Broiler eggs were incubated at a lower or higher temperature (36.8°C, 38.8°C) relative to control (37.8°C) over two developmental intervals, embryonic days (ED) 7-10 and 10-13. Global gene expression of Musculus pectoralis major was assayed at ED 10, ED 13, and slaughter age [post-hatch day (D) 35] (6 groups; 3 time points; 8 animals each) by microarray analysis and treated samples were compared to controls within each time point
