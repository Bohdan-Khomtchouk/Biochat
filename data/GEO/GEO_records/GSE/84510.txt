TITLE
Expression data from epidermal stem cells from young mice fed either with normal diet or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High fat diet (HFD), if prolonged, leads to obesity thereby accelerating the development of many ageing-related pathologies including chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a higher predisposition to develop cancer. We asked whether HFD could reprogram the circadian output of young stem cells in a manner similar to what we observed during physiological ageing. HFD has been recently shown to induce a rewiring of the liver circadian transcriptome and metabolome, although in an obesity-independent manner. We therefore fed young (8 week old) C57Bl6 mice with HFD or its control diet for 7-weeks, a time when mice had not yet become obese, and performed circadian transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
Eight week old female C57B6/J mice were fed ad libitum either with high fat or with the respective control diet. The experiment lasted for 7 weeks, and four mice were used per each of the 6 time points (ZT0, ZT4, ZT8, ZT12, ZT16, ZT20) and per diet group. For sample collection, 4 mice per diet group were sacrificed per day, all belonging to one time point.
