TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis to profile the transcriptome of Bone Marrow  Dendritic Cells exposed to different antigen delivery systems

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we report the analysis of the transcriptome of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exposed to the different antigen delivery systems to dissect the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the immune response upon  vaccination. RNA-Sequencing revealed that exposure of dendritic cells to diffent antigen display vehicules causes the deregulation of molecules involved in the immune response, at a different extent, depending on the carrier. In vaccinology, patterns of gene expression induced by priming antigen presenting cells (APCs), could be used to predict immunogenicity and the type of T-helper cell polarization, and/or to helpin selecting an appropriate adjuvant to administer in the vaccine formulation.

DESIGN
Bone marrow precursor at day 7 of GM-CSF culture were exposed or not to LPS deprived bacteriophage, bacteriophage modified to be targeted to DC or to the E2 protein scaffold

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
