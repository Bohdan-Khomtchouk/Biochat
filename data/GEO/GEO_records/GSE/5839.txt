TITLE
Microarray analysis of Multiples Sclerosis Brain tissue in comparison to control brain tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MS is a primary demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The cause is unknown and pathological hallmarks include plaque formation with immune cell infiltration. A microarray analysis of characterized brain tissue samples from three MS cases and a non-neurological control sample was performed containing over 22,000 genes. Real-time PCR analyses of 7 MS samples and 3 non-neurological control brain samples confirmed changes in expression in the chosen genes of interest. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Three MS cases and a non-neurological control sample were used.
