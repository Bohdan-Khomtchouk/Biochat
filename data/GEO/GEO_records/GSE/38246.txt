TITLE
Transcriptional response to dengue infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Nicaraguan children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured fever-day-specific genome-wide transcript abundance patterns in 105 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples collected from 41 children hospitalized with dengue virus (DENV) infection in Nicaragua, and from 8 healthy controls.  DF1 = primary DF; DF2 = secondary DF; DHF = Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever; DSS = Dengue Shock Syndrome. Samples were collected from pediatric patients with DENV infection at the Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jesus Rivera (HIMJR) in Managua, Nicaragua.  Enrollment criteria consisted of hospitalized patients younger than 15 years of age whose parents or guardians completed the informed consent process, and for children 6 years and older who provided assent, and who presented with acute febrile illness of less than 7 days duration with one or more of the following symptoms or signs at the time of evaluation: headache, arthralgia, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, positive tourniquet test, petechiae, and signs of bleeding. Children were considered to have dengue if DENV was detected by RT-PCR or by isolation in cell culture, if an IgM ELISA indicated seroconversion between the acute and convalescent sample, and/or if there was a > 4-fold increase in DENV-specific antibodies between the acute and convalescent phase. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood within four hours of collection and stored in Trizol at -80 oC
