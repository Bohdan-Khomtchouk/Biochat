TITLE
Expression data from chemokine-deficient mus musculus subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We inflicted TBI to chemokine-deficient mouse lines in order to establish involvement of various signalling pathways that may be addressed therapeutically. Interacting chemokine pathways in brain regulate distinct inflammatory cells. Activated microglia are separate from invading phagocytes and dendritic cells. Findings show potential targets to interfere with specific inflammatory responses after brain injury.

DESIGN
TBI was carried out in Ccl3-/- and Ccr2-/- mice, total RNA prepared from injured cerebral neocortex after three days. RNA samples were from uninjured Ccl3-/- and Ccr2-/- mice as reference for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
