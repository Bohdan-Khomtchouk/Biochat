TITLE
Expression Data from Arabidopsis suspension T87 cells, protoplasts, and osmotic stress-treated cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Primary cell wall (PCW) in plant mainly consists of three kinds of polysaccharides, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Although many genes encoding a variety of enzymes involved in synthesis, degradation, or modification of the PCW-related polysaccharides have been reported, regulation on expression of these PCW-related genes during PCW formation is still not fully understood. In this study, expression changes of PCW-related genes were analyzed during PCW regeneration in protoplasts. We used microarrays to reveal the global gene expression response against primary cell wall integrity stress during the primary cell wall regeneration in protoplasts.

DESIGN
4-day-old Arabidopsis T87 suspension cells were collected as the intact samples. The 4-day-old T87 cells were treated with enzyme mixture containing 1% cellulase Onozuka RS and 0.5% pectolyase Y-23 in 0.35 M mannitol for 1.5 h on a shaker at 50 rpm at 22 °C to digest the primary cell wall completely. Then the cells were washed by 0.4M mannitol three times, and re-suspended into the medium containing 0.4M mannitol. After 3 hours incubation at 22 °C, the cell wall-digested cells were collected as the protoplast samples. Also, 4-day-old T87 cells were treated with the medium containing 0.4M mannitol for 3 hours, and were collected as the osmotic stress-treated samples. Three independent biological replicate samples were obtained for RNA extraction and Affymetrix ATH-1 microarray.
