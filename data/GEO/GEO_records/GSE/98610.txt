TITLE
Ribosome footprints sequencing from Arabidopsis thaliana roots during Pi starvation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional gene regulation plays a significant role in the response to Pi starvation. Here, we utilized advances in next-generation sequencing technology to examine changes in transcriptional control, RNA association with translating ribosomes in 14-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to 7 days of Pi starvation.

DESIGN
14 samples, 2 conditions 500uM NaH2PO4,  0uM NaH2PO4. 2 bioreplicates of 4 RNA pools (total mRNA, ribosome footprints, small RNA, double stranded RNA)
