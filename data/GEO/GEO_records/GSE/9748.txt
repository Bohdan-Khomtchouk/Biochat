TITLE
Identification of differentially regulated genes in Populus deltoides subjected to copper stress using 4.6K cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
cDNA macroarray expression profiling was carried out in poplar roots in order to identify genes regulated in response to exposition to copper stress. For this purpose, plants of a Populus deltoides clone grown in a hydroponic system during four  weeks were incubated in a nutrient solution (Hoagland's modiefied salt, ¼ strength) supplemented with copper (0 µM (control), 30 µM and 60 µM). Roots were sampled at 12 and 24 h after exposition in a time-course experiment.
