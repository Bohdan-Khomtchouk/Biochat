TITLE
Identification of differentially regulated genes in Populus deltoides subjected to copper stress using 4.6K cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
cDNA macroarray expression profiling was carried out in poplar roots in order to identify genes regulated in response to exposition to copper stress. For this purpose, plants of a Populus deltoides clone grown in a hydroponic system during four  weeks were incubated in a nutrient solution (Hoagland's modiefied salt, ¼ strength) supplemented with copper (0 µM (control), 30 µM and 60 µM). Roots were sampled at 12 and 24 h after exposition in a time-course experiment.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates named Rep1, Rep2 and Rep3 were obtained for each copper treatment (i.e., control, Cu30 and Cu60) at each time point (i.e., 12, 24). At each time point, two comparisons were performed: control treatment versus Cu30 and control treatment versus Cu60. For each comparison, biological triplicates were used to identify transcripts differentially regulated at the considered timepoint using a statistical analysis approach based on linear mixed models by the SAS system.
