TITLE
Epigenome analysis of oropharygeal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and primary oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples, some infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in tissue samples. Samples included 46 oropharyngeal SCC primary tumors and 46 normal adjacent mucosal samples. For each tumor sample, HPV status (positivity based on both DNA and E6/E7 RNA) and p16 immunohistochemistry status is included.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 46 primary tumors and 46 matched adjacent normal samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
