TITLE
Gene expression in human lung cancer cell lines regulated by Bmi-1 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to understand the role that B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi-1) plays in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. According to fold-change screening between Bmi-1-silencing A549 and the control cells A549, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were shown.

DESIGN
Bmi-1 knockdown in A549 cells were noted as A549-shRNA-Bmi-1 and the respective control cells were named as A549-shRNA-control.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
