TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in chromate transformed BEAS-2B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established chromate transformed cell lines by chronic exposure of normal human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to low doses of hexavalent chromium followed by anchorage-independent growth. The gene expression profiles were analyzed in the established cell lines. The gene expression profiles from six chromate transformed cell lines were remarkably similar to each other yet differed significantly from that of either control cell line or normal Beas-2B cells. A total of 409 differentially expressed genes were identified in chromate transformed cells compared to control cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression profiles from 10 cell lines ( six chromated transformed cells lines, three control cell lines, and parental BEAS-2B cells) using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array. No techinical replicates were performed.
