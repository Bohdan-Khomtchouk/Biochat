TITLE
Evolution of sex-dependent gene expression in three recently diverged species of Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila persimilis ; Drosophila pseudoobscura ; Drosophila pseudoobscura bogotana

SUMMARY
To identify the transcriptome divergence and sex roles underlying it in recently diverged Drosophia pseudoobscura group, we compare the global gene expression of 7-day-old whole body adults of pure species.

DESIGN
7-day-old virgin flies were assayed by species and sex.  At least three isofemale inbred lines were used for each species (D. pseudoobscura; D. persimilis; D. pseudoobscura bogotana).All lines of each species were pooled in equal amounts.Two separate labeling reactions per sample were pooled and hybridized to the Agilent single color (Cyanine 3-CTP dye) arrays. Three different replicates were hybridized for each species and sex.
