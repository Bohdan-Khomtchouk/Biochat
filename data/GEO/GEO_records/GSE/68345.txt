TITLE
RNAseq and Lariat sequencing of different S. pombe growth conditions

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We performed lariat sequencing to profile the diversity of spliced RNA lariats in S. pombe identify annotated and alternate introns.

DESIGN
Three different growth conditions were used to grow S. pombe wt and S. pombe Δdbr1. Lariat sequencing of the Δdbr1 strains and RNAseq of the wt and Δdbr1 strains were done to profile intron lariats and exon-exon junctions in RNA transcripts.
