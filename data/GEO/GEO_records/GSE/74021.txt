TITLE
Gene expression signatures for IhhN protein induced cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous studies demonstrated that hererozygous missense mutations in IHH could lead to a decreasing IHH signaling efficacy and cause brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1). For revealing difference of Gli1-mediated downstream regulatory effects between wild type IHH signaling and E95K mutant IHH signaling, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to be targets of Gli1 cis-regulation.

DESIGN
Gene expressions of Wild type IhhN protein-induced or E95K mutant IhhN protein-induced  were measured after 48-hour incubation in the presence of 750nM protein. Non-protein induced cells were as control.
