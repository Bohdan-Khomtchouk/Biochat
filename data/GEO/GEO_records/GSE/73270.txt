TITLE
Epigenome analysis of IDH1 mutant and IDH1/2 wild-type patient derived glioblastoma tumorsphere lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of ths study is to compare global methylation status between 1) IDH1 mutant and IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma tumorsphere cells and 2) MGG152 (IDH1 mutant) with DMSO and IDH1 inhibitor treatment. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of patient derived glioblastoma tumorsphere and HT1080 cells. The Illumina Infinium  Human DNA methylation Beadchip450  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 10 samples and one control were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium  Human Methylation Beadchip450. Please note that the MGG (in the sample title) represents patient-derived MGH glioblastoma cell lines. Regarding MGG152 samples, sample no.1 is low passage number and used for comparison between IDH1 mt and wild-type. Sample no. 2-4 were used for assessing DNA methylation change after short term or long term IDH1 inhibiting treatment.
