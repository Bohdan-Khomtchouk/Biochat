TITLE
Gene expression in murine acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vivo after allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study compared gene expression in murine bcr-abl positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in vivo in allogeneic BMT recipients compared to syngneneic BMT recipients.

DESIGN
The goal of the experiment was to compare gene expression in leukemia cells that were in either an allogeneic transplant (5 samples) or syngeneic transplant (5 samples) immune environment in vivo. The bone marrow transplant model involved preparation of C57BL/6 recipients with total body irradiation and 5-fluoruracil. These recipients were then infused IV with either allogeneic C3.SW marrow and spleen cells or syngeneic C57BL/6 marrow and spleen cells. The leukemia cells were mixed in with the marrow and spleen cells.  After a few weeks (2-3) the C57BL/6 leukemia cells were purified by flow cytometry and passed into other freshly transplanted animals. After three serial transplants the leukemia cells were flow purified and RNA prepared. Leukemia was C57BL/6 background (cells contain the human p210 bcr/abl oncogenic fusion gene and also have a deletion in the Ink4a/Arf locus, see: Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. 14:622-630, 2008).
