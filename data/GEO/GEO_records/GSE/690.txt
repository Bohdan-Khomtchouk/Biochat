TITLE
HMF3A_RNAi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HMF3A cells, created from adult human mammary fibroblasts by immortalisation with a thermolabile SV40 large T antigen and the catalytic sub-unit of human telomerase, undergo co-ordinated induction of cellular senescence upon inactivation of T antigen. The pSUPER-retro vector system (Brummelkamp, 2002) was used to selectively target genes for mRNA degradation in an attempt to determine if they had a role, in the changes to the transcriptome upon LT inactivation. The genes chosen for targeting were BTG2, NR4A3, DUSP1, PHLDA1 and STACb.
