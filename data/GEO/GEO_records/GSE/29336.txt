TITLE
Comparison of male and female floral organs

ORGANISM
Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
We conducted micro-array analysis to quantify the global transcriptome variations in floral organs of a male and female tree allowing for identification of sex-linked transcripts. We used RNA samples from male floral buds in August and female floral buds in Spetemeber. Bud scale were removed. While the sampling time differed, the developmental stage of the floral organs was similar between the male and female.

DESIGN
Five independent samples of floral bud tissues with bud scales removes were collected from the upper crown  of a sexually mature male tree and female tree. RNA was extracted from tissues and hybridized on Affymetrix Genechip Poplar Genome Array.
