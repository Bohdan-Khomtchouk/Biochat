TITLE
Experiment 4: Affymetrix validation array

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish embryo were analyzed at 30 and 60 % epiboly for changes in transcriptome of wild-type and MTspg mutant embryos The Data are used as an independent experimental validation of data obtained for the same stages by Agilent arrays in the main experiments (especially Exp. 1)

DESIGN
Experiments were performed in biological duplicate.  Genedata Expressionist Analyst was used for comparison  betwen MZspg and WT gene expression levels at each stage
