TITLE
Transcriptome of human ILC2s; primary vs IL-1b-primed

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ILC2s regulate type2 immune responses and protect against helminth infection. We found that ILC2s can be expanded in the presence of a combination of cytokines IL-2 and IL-1b. To better understand the functional and phenotypic consequence of IL-1β activation of ILC2s, we utilized whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of freshly isolated ILC2s and IL-1β-primed ILC2s. Differential expression analysis revealed a substantial number of genes underwent significant change between the two conditions (total 4,744 gene, FDR < 0.01, Fold change > 2), among which 3,871 genes were upregulated in IL-1β –primed ILC2s.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed, three biological replicates of isolated ILC2s and three biological replicates of isolated ILC2s cultured with IL-1b

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
