TITLE
Integrative analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from pigs infected with H1N1 swine influenza A virus at different time points

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study is to analyze differentially expressed microRNAs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages  from pigs infected with H1N1 swine influenza A virus at different time points. Methods: miRNA profiles in PAMs from pigs infected with H1N1 SwIV at three time points were generated by deep sequencing. Differentially expressed miRNAs were then identified and their targets were predicted. For these targets, GO and KEGG analyses were performed and protein-protein interaction networks regulated by DE miRNAs were constructed. Results: Comparing to control group, 70 and 16 DE miRNAs were respectively identified on post-infection day (PID) 4 and PID 7. 56 DE miRNAs were identified between PID4 and PID7. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that most of targets for these DE miRNAs were related to immune and inflammatory  responses. Conclusions: Our study represents the first integrative analysis of DE miRNAs in PAMs infected with H1N1 SwIV at different time points. The results in this study would enable us to better understand the underlying pathogenesis of H1N1 SwIV infection in pigs. Furthermore, these data would be very useful for investigating the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human inï¬‚uenza because pig serves as an excellent animal model to study human diseases.
