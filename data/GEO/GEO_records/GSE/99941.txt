TITLE
Effects of PPARgamma-inactive Delta-2-TGZ on breast cancer cells MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGZ is an agonist of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma. This synthetic compound displays anticancer effects on breast cancer cells but some of them are PPARgamma independent. Delta-2-TGZ (delta-2-troglotazone) is a PPARgamma inactive TGZ derivative possessing a double bond adjoining the thiazolidinedione ring. This compound still displays anticancer efefcts. It is an interesting tool to study the PPARgamma-independent mechanisms. We used microarrays to examine the global programme of gene expression in response to Delta-2-TGZ treatment in MCF7 cell line.

DESIGN
We compare global gene expression levels between untreated and delta-2-troglitazone treated MCF7 cells at 12H. Each data point was realized in triplicate
