TITLE
Identification of markers of responsiveness in rheumatoid arthritis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite the increasing of available drugs in RA, the overall rate of non response is 30 to 40% of treated patients. To optimize the drug prescription and better elaborate the therapeutic strategies, gene profiling in PBMCs was used to predict the responsiveness to anakinra. Thirty two patients treated by anakinra (100mg/day s.c.) and mÃ©thotrexate, were categorized as responders whenever a change of Disease Activity Score 28 > 1.2 was obtained at 3 months. Blood from treated patients was collected at baseline. In 7 responders and 7 non responders, 51 mRNAs identified by microarray were expressed as a function of the response to treatment and an unsupervised hierarchical clustering perfectly separated responders from non responders. Keywords: anakinra effect
