TITLE
Genes upregulated by HLX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HLX was found as a VEGF-A induced gene in HUVEC (B.Schweighofer, submitted). In order to detect genes regulated by HLX HUVEC were infected by recombinant adenovirus expressing HLX for 4, 8, 16 and 32h. RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
HUVEC were infected with a MOI of 40 with either HLX expressing or empty adenovirus for 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. HUVEC without an adenovirus infection were used as control.Total RNA was isolated with Trizol according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Gene expression was analysed with Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays according to the Affymetrix protocol.
