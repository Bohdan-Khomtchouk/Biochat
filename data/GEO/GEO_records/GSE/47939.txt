SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in organ development. MicroRNA expression profiling is an effective method of acquiring novel and valuable information. In this study, using miRNA microarray technology, we finally validate three over-expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1323 and hsa-miR-93) and one under-expressed miRNA (hsa-miR-143*) in NSCP group. Target gene WNT5A of hsa-miR-143* was up-regulated, while target gene FGFR2 of hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1323 and hsa-miR-93 was down-regulated in the NSCP group compared to the control group. The association of miRNAs expression levels with the risk of developing NSCP, the correlation with age and gender were analyzed. The risk analysis identified that odds ratio (95% CI) of hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1323 and hsa-miR-93 was higher ranged from 9.75 (1.642-57.89) to 13.67 (2.480-75.30) and pï¼œ0.05. Neither age nor gender was associated with the four miRNAs expression levels. In male cases, the association of hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1323, hsa-miR-93 and hsa-miR-143* expression levels with NSCP was observed and the p value was 0.0012, 0.0008, 0.0088 and 0.0385, respectively. Bioinformatics approaches identified nine KEGG pathways enriched in predicted target genes. In summary, we firstly defined miRNAs profiles and target genes in human soft palate tissue. Four distinctive miRNAs and their target genes expression in NSCP will advance our understanding of the genetic progress of this complex disease. Further exploration will be needed to elucidate how these miRNAs and target genes modulate signaling pathways during palatogenesis.
