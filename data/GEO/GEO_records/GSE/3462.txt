TITLE
Triiodothyronine Treatment: Effects on vastus lateralis skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Healthy men received 75 5g/d of T3 for 14 days. Microbiopsies of vastus lateralis skeletal muscle were performed before and after the treatment. For microarray experiments, we used samples from five subjects. After amplification of total RNA (Wang et al. 2000a), fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from each experimental sample. For each subject, probes from basal and T3 treatment conditions labeled with cyanine (Cy) 3 or Cy5 dyes were hybridized to cDNA microarray. After a filtering procedure to eliminate bad-quality spots and background correction, log2 transformed data for each experiment were normalized and centered to the mean. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set

DESIGN
Using regression correlation
