TITLE
The effects of bifenthrin on the transcriptome of a euryhaline fish

ORGANISM
Menidia beryllina

SUMMARY
Bifenthrin is a commonly detected pesticide in California surfacewaters; however the effects of bifenthrin on aquatic organisms are complex and poorly understood. This study presents the transcriptome-wide response of the inland silverside, Menidia beryllina, to chronic 14 d exposures to bifenthrin.

DESIGN
Twenty-three samples were run on 23 arrays, there were 4-7 replicates for each of three bifenthrin exposure concentrations and a control group.
