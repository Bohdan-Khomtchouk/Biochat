TITLE
ChIP-exo analysis of the DNA-binding sites of the yeast transcription factor Yfl052w sequenced by SOLiD

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We determined DNA-binding sites of the yeast transcription factor Yfl052w by ChIP-exo. Cells were grown in the YP media containing palatinose. Yfl052w was tagged with HA tag and anti-HA antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation.

DESIGN
Examination of Yfl052 trancription factor in HA-tagged and wt cells (as a control)

PLATFORM
