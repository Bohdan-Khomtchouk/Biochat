TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human peripheral T cell lymphoma cases vs. reactive lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a very aggressive disease which currently lacks efficient targeted therapy. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the very poor outcome of these patients. However, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. In this study, we performed a gene expression profiling analysis of a series of 38 PTCL cases in order to find deregulated pathways or genes that could become therapeutic agents for PTCL patients.

DESIGN
38 PTCL cases and 6 reactive lymph nodes were hybridized with the Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which served as the reference sample.
