TITLE
mRNA expression analysis of undifferentiated Dicer +/- (D4) and Dicer -/- (27H10) embryonic cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the transcript expression levels in Dicer heterozygous and Dicer knock-out embryonic stem (ES) cells  in order to identify which transcripts are regulated by RNAi pathway in mouse ES cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison of cell line with or without knock-out
