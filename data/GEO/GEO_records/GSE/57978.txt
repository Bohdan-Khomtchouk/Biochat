SUMMARY
Primary glioma stem cells cultured as neurospheres in NBL media with growth factors were subjected to treatment with the non-toxic, non-psychoactive cannabis compound cannabidiol (CBD). Control and CBD- treated cultures were used to generate RNA used to hybridize on Affymetrix DNA arrays

Fluorescence intensities data were RMA-normalized using Partek software.
