TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild type and gl3 egl3 trichomeless mutant green seedling tissues

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The development of trichomes (leaf hairs) from pluripotent epidermal cells in Arabidopsis provides a powerful system to investigate the regulatory motifs involved in plant cell differentiation. Genetic studies have revealed that a bHLH transcription factor, GL3, activates downstream genes required for trichome initiation by interacting with a R2R3-MYB protein, GL1. We have taken advantage of several mutants in the trichome developmental pathway and gene expression analyses to identify a set of genes expressed predominantly in Arabidopsis trichomes.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression between the wild type and trichome mutant, gl3 egl3 using green tissue (not include root).
