TITLE
The transcriptomes of novel marmoset monkey embryonic stem cell lines reflect genomic features

ORGANISM
Callithrix jacchus

SUMMARY
We report the generation and characterization of four novel marmoset monkey ES cell lines, derived from natural preimplantation embryos. Two cell lines were obtained from non-compacted morulae (DPZcjESC1 and 2), while the other two cell lines were derived from a compacted morula (DPZcjESC3) and an expanded blastocyst (DPZcjESC4), respectively. DPZcjESC1 and 2 showed trisomies for one and two chromosomes respectively, while DPZcjESC3 and 4 are euploid. We detected no obvious differences between morula- and blastocyst-derived cell lines. However, quantitative chromosome-wise transcriptome analyses precisely reflected the trisomies. We also show that the female ES cell lines exhibit different states of X-inactivation which is also impressively reflected by the abundance of the lncRNA X inactive-specific transcript (XIST).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of four different ES cell lines were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using an Illumina HiSeq2000.
