TITLE
Gene expression in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with methotrexate treatment response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide assessment of gene expression in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells was performed to identify genomic determinants of MTXâ€™s antileukemic effects. Reduction of circulating leukemia cells after in vivo methotrexate treatment served as a measure MTX's antileukemic effects. Keywords: gene expression associated with drug response
