TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow macrophage derived from lean and obese mice after 1,4, and 24h exposition to P.gingivalis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease that weakens macrophage innate immune response to infections. Since M1 polarization is crucial during acute infectious diseases, we hypothesized that diet-induced obesity inhibits M1 polarization of macrophages in the response to bacterial infection. Using a computational approach in conjunction with microarray data, we identified switching genes that may differentially control the behavior of response pathways in macrophages from lean and obese mice.

DESIGN
Bone marrow macrophages (BMMΦ) from lean and obese mice were exposed to live Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) for three incubation times (1 h, 4 h and 24 h). cDNA from BMMΦ of lean and obese mice were hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays. Hybridization was performed on three replicates at each time point (18 arrays total).
