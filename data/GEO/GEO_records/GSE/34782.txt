TITLE
Changes in gene expression from postnatal (3 wk and 4 wk) to young adult (8 wk) male and female mouse liver (Mus musculus)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of male and female CD-1 mouse liver was carried out at 3, 4, and 8 wk of age to elucidate developmental changes in gene expression from the pre-pubertal period to young adulthood.  A large number of sex-biased and sex-independent genes showed significant changes during this developmental period.  Notably, sex-independent genes involved in cell cycle, chromosome condensation, and DNA replication were down regulated from 3 wk to 8 wk, while genes associated with metal ion binding, ion transport and kinase activity were up regulated.  A majority of genes showing sex differential expression in adult liver did not display sex differences prior to puberty, at which time extensive changes in sex-specific gene expression were seen, primarily in males.  Thus, in male liver, 76% of male-specific genes were up regulated and 47% of female-specific genes were down regulated from 3 to 8 wk of age, whereas in female liver 67% of sex-specific genes showed no significant change in expression.  In both sexes, genes up regulated from 3 to 8 wk were significantly enriched (p < E-76) in the set of genes positively regulated by the liver transcription factor HNF4α, as determined in a liver-specific HNF4α knockout mouse model, while genes down regulated during this developmental period showed significant enrichment (p < E-65) for negative regulation by HNF4α. Significant enrichment of the developmentally regulated genes in genes subject to positive and negative regulation by pituitary hormone was also observed. Nine sex-specific transcription factors showed pubertal changes in expression and may contribute to the developmental changes that onset after 3-4 wk.  Overall, the observed changes in gene expression during postnatal liver development reflect the deceleration of liver growth and the induction of specialized liver functions, with widespread changes in sex-specific gene expression primarily occurring in male liver.

DESIGN
Liver RNA isolated from the following six groups of CD-1 mice was used in the present study:  3 wk old male (M) mice (n = 10; 5 per each pool) and female (F) mice (n = 10; 5 per each pool); 4 wk old male mice (n = 12; 6 per each pool) and female mice (n = 12; 6 per each pool); 8 wk old male mice (n = 12; 6 per each pool) and female mice (n = 12; 6 per each pool).  These RNA pools were used in seven separate sets of competitive hybridization experiments: 1) 3 wk M vs. 3 wk F; 2) 4 wk M vs. 4 wk F; 3) 8 wk M vs. 8 wk F; 4) 3 wk M vs. 8 wk M; 5) 4 wk M vs. 8 wk M; 6) 3 wk F vs. 8 wk F; 7) 4 wk F vs. 8 wk F.  Fluorescent labeling of RNA and hybridization of the Alexa 555-labeled (green) and Alexa 647-labeled (red) aRNA samples to Agilent Mouse Gene Expression 4x44k v2 microarrays (Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA; catalog # G4846A-026655) were carried out, with dye swapping for each of the seven hybridization experiments to eliminate dye bias.  Two microarrays, one for each mixed cDNA sample, were hybridized for each of the seven fluorescent reverse pairs, giving a total of 14 microarrays.
