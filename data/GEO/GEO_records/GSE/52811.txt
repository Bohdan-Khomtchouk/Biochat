TITLE
microRNA expression in oral keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This was a hypothesis generating experiment to look at miR expression in a range of oral keratinocytes, including normal, precancer and oral cancer samples.  The cells were cultures as per standard protocols (duplicate cultures) before assessment on the Affy miRNA array (1.0)

DESIGN
one normal oral keratinocyte, one precancer, and 2 cancer samples, all in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
