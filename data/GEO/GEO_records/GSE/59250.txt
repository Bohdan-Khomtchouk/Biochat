TITLE
DNA Methylation Analysis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study performed Illumina Methylation450 analysis of CD4+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells and CD14+ Monocytes from lupus patients and controls.  A validation cohort was further analyzed with the same platform using CD4+ T-cells, CD45RO-CD45RA+ naive T-cells, CD45RO+CD45RA- memory T-cells, and CD25+CD127- regulatory T-cells.

DESIGN
SLE v Control comparisions were made within each cell type.  The SLE patient samples are labeled SLEnnnn and the controls Xnnnn.  The cell type CD4, CD14, CD19, Tmem, Treg, Tnaive is appended to each sample ID.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
