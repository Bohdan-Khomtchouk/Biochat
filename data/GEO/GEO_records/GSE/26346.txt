TITLE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue (eutopic tissue) outside the uterus (ectopic tissue). We assessed differentially expressed microRNAs in ectopic endometrium compared with eutopic endometrium.

DESIGN
Comparison of paired eutopic/ectopic endometrium microRNAs from three patients.
