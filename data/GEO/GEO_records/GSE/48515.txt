TITLE
ChIP-seq in MRC5 hIPSCs overexpressing MEG3 RNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to detect differences in PRC2 occupancy in a human induced pluripotent cell line (MRC5) naturally deficient in MEG3 RNA after lentiviral overexpression of MEG3.

DESIGN
MRC5 were transduced with lentiviruses for the overexpression of MEG3 lncRNA or GFP as a control. ChIP-seq was performed with EZH2 and JARID2 antibodies.

PLATFORM
