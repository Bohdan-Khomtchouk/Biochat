TITLE
Whole genome gene expression analysis of evolved polyploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell lines at 36 degrees Celsius

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional change by profiling yeast cells, comparing polyploid S. cerevisiae cells at 1000 generations with ancestral cells. Transcriptional change by profiling yeast cells, comparing both ancestral and evolved cells with diploid cells, stands for control.

DESIGN
Evolved vs. ancestral cell, independently grown and harvested. Technical triplicates for RNA isolation.

PLATFORM
GPL18498 IMB yeast 7K operon oligo array for gene expression
