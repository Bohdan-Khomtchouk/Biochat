TITLE
miRNA expression differences between FFPE prostate cancer and adjacent normal  tissues using real-time quantitative PCR array analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Laser Capture Microdissected cells from archival FFPE Prostate cancer and normal adjacent tissues from 10 patients (5 CA and 5 AA) were converted to cDNA and analysed by PCR array to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between the groups. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs were further validated in tissues from 40 prostate cancer patients. The miRNAs which were differentially modulated in PCa patients in the validation set were further analysed in 32 urine samples from PCa patients and compared with 12 healthy individuals. Differentially expressed miRNAs were explored to e used as non-invasive biomarker for PCa.

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling.  mRNA  from 10 Prostate Cancer patients  (5 Caucasian American and 5 African American) and their paired adjacent normal tissue were analysed to identify the differentially expressed miRNA between the groups. Equal amount small RNA from each group was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
