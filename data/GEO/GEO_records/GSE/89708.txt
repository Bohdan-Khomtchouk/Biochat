TITLE
Simultaneous detection of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in cell cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to comprehensively assess chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation dynamic in different cell cycle phases, we found DNA methylation is stable in different phases wherase chromatin accessibility underwent enormous changes, but local structure at NDR and NSR are well preserved to maintain cellular identity.

DESIGN
Examine DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility by high throughput sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
