TITLE
NF2 disruption by genomic rearrangments drives a subset of radiation induced meningiomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of spontaneous meningiomas and meningiomas from patients who had received radiotherapy for previous medical condition. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Samples include 18 radiation induced meningiomas and 19 spontaneous meningiomas.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 37 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
