TITLE
Stress response of a marine ammonia-oxidizing archaeon N. maritimus SCM1 to copper

ORGANISM
Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1

SUMMARY
We used transcription analyses to explore the whole cellular response of Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1 to varying  copper concentrations, and relate those patterns to its global proteome.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was used to profile transcriptomics responses of N. maritimus induced by copper limitation and toxicity. Two replicates for Cu-limited and Cu-replete experiments and three replicates for Cu-toxic experiments were sequenced.
