TITLE
Comparative expression of whole duodenum from intestinal Arx deficient mice and control littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The enteroendocrine lineage secretes hormones which direct the digestion, absorption, and motility of the intestine. Arx is a transcription factor expressed specifically in the enteroendocrine cells. With intestinal-specific loss of Arx, hormonal expression is disrupted. We used microarrays to determine the differential expression of genes from the whole duodenum after removal of Arx, a gene specifically expressed in the enteroendocrine lineage, in the intestinal epithelium compared to littermate controls at postnatal day 5.

DESIGN
Whole duodenum was dissected from postnatal day 5 mice. RNA extraction was performed with Trizol and then RNA was hybridized on Agilent 2-color microarray.
