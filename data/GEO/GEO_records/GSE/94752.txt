TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling identifies KLF15 and SLC25A10 as regulators of adipocytes insulin sensitivity in obese women [WAT]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify new genes controlling insulin sensitivity in adipocytes from obese women with either insulin-resistant (OIR) or -sensitive (OIS) adipocytes. 432 genes were differentially expressed between the OIR and OIS group (FDR < 5%). These genes are enriched in pathways related to glucose and amino acid metabolism, cellular respiration, and insulin signaling, and include SLC2A4, AKT2, as well as enzymes in the mitochondria respiratory chain. Two IR-associated genes, KLF15 and SLC25A10, were selected for functional evaluation.

DESIGN
Insulin sensitivity was determined by measuring lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT). We performed microarray-based transcriptome profiling on subcutaneous WAT specimen from 9 lean, 21 OIS and 18 obese OIR women. Patients were examined in the morning after 12 hrs fasting. An abdominal subcutaneous WAT biopsy was obtained by needle aspiration. From WAT specimen we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and then washed, stained and scanned the slides using standardised protocols (Affymetrix Inc.). Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was used to compare the difference in gene expression between groups.
