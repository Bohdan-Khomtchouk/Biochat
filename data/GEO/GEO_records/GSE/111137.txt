TITLE
Expression data of innate or antigen-induced memory cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pool of memory-phenotype CD8 T cells is composed of antigen-induced (AI) and cytokine-induced innate (IN) cells.  Pathogen-induced AI memory cells can be distinguished from naturally-generated IN memory cells by surface expression of NKG2D. AI also differ from IN memory CD8 T cells by their capacity to migrate to the lung parenchyma upon inflammation or infection, a process dependent on their expression of ITGA1/CD49a and ITGA4/CD49d integrins. We used microarrays to identify  gene expression signatures  that distinguish antigen-induced (AI) from cytokine-induced innate (IN) memory cells.

DESIGN
AI and IN memory CD8 T cells (CD8+CD44+) were sorted from naive or vaccinia primed C57Bl/6 mice based on the expression of  NKG2D. Tcr Transgenic F5 CD8 T cells were transferred in naive mice before intra-nasal infection with vaccinia virus. Memory CD8 T cells F5, AI and IN were isolated from the same pool of infected mice, in the memory phase, i.e. at least 80 days post infection. CD8 T cell samples were purified from a pool of 3 to 8 spleens. 4 to 5 biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition.
