TITLE
Gene expression data of livers from C57BL/6 fed a normal diet or high-fat-diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is tightly associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced fatty liver remain largely unknown.In order to identify genes that are potentially involved in dysfunctional hepatic lipid homeostasis in obesity, we performed a clustering analysis of Affymetrix arrays,which revealed that a number of mRNAs were dys-regulated in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), compared with mice fed a normal chow diet (ND).

DESIGN
To identify genes that are potentially involved in dysfunctional hepatic lipid homeostasis in obesity, male C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were fed a normal diet (ND) or high-fat-diet (HFD) containing 60 Kcal% of fat for 12 weeks. Then mice were sacrificed and total RNAs were isoloated from hepatic tissues. Affymetrix array hybridisation and scanning were performed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 chips.Total RNA samples obtained from six mice per group (ND and HFD) and pooled by each of the two were used for microarray analysis.
