TITLE
Co-regulated gene expression by estrogen receptor-a and liver receptor homolog-1 is a feature of the estrogen response in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our findings establish a key role for LRH-1 in the regulation of ERa target genes in breast cancer cells and identify a mechanism in which co-operative binding of LRH-1 and ERa at estrogen response elements controls the expression of estrogen responsive g

DESIGN
Examination of ERÎ±, with or without LRH-1 knockdown, and HA-LRH-1 in MCF-7 cells

PLATFORM
