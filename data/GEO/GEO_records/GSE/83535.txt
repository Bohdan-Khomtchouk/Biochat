TITLE
Expression data from Hif-p4h-1 WT vs KO mouse embyonic fibroblasts under normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of inflammatory genes were downregulated in Hif-p4h-1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts both in normoxic and hypoxic condition, whereas the apoptosis regulation genes were upregulated or anti-apoptotic genes were downregulated in Hif-p4h-1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We used microarray to study the differential expression of genes in Hif-p4h-1 knockout versus WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated at E14.5 days and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.
