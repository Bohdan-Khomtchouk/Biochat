TITLE
Expression data from CD44-knockdown MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis still remain unclear. To explore this issue, we established the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA against CD44.

DESIGN
The CD44-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231 shCD44-2 and shCD44-3) were analyzed. As control, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing shRNA against firefly luciferase (shLuc) were used. Total of three samples. No replicates.
