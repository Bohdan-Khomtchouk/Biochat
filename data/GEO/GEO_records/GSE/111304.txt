TITLE
Macrophage microRNA-150 promotes pathological angiogenesis as seen in age-related macular degeneration: part I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophage aging is pathogenic in numerous age-associated diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. The purpose of this experiment was to profile microRNA expression in young and aged macrophages at baseline and in response to oxLDL and acLDL.

DESIGN
We prepared 24 samples (N=4/group with 3 treatments and 2 ages). We identified 3 outliers after principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, which we omitted from further analysis.
