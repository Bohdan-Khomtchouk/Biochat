TITLE
A RUNX2-mediated Epigenetic Regulation of the Survival of p53 Defective Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify transcripts that are regulated by RUNX2 in SAOS2 cells.

DESIGN
SAOS2 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing shLuc, shRUNX2_3 and shRUNX2_4 for 4 days followed by 2ug/ul puromycin selection to remove untransduced cells. A no-virus control was included to monitor the transduction efficiency. These control cells died after 2 days of puromycin selection. The lentivirally transduced cells were more than 80% survived, which indicates a high transduction efficiency. After four more days in puromycin, SAOS2 cells were harvested and subjected to total RNA extraction. 1ug total RNA were used to perform RNA-seq.
