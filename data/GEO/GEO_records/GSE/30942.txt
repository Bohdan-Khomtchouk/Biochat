TITLE
Rice gene global expression during nonhost interaction with Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Powdery mildew is a very common plant disease and only few plants are immune. Host interactions have been identified and characterized for the pathosystems barley-B. graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) and wheat-B. graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), whereas no data are reported about powdery mildew and nonhost plants, such as rice. On the other hand rice nonhost resistance is widely unexploited and only few expression data are available. To characterize rice response during nonhost interaction with Bgh, a global expression analysis was performed by using the GeneChip® Rice Genome Array. To describe rice gene expression profiles during nonhost interaction, 2 week-old rice plantlets were inoculated with Bgh. Treated (inoculated) and control (mock) samples were collected 24 hours post-inoculation for GeneChip® Rice Genome Array hybridization.

DESIGN
For transcript proﬁling experiments with powdery mildew, entire leaves were sampled from rice plantlets 2 weeks old (cv. Nipponbare). Treated and control (mock) rice leaves were collected 24 hours post inoculation. Three biological replicates for inoculated and control plants were extracted and analysed independently with the GeneChip® Rice Genome Array.
