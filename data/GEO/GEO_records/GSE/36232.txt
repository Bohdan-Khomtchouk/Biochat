TITLE
RNA-Sequencing from ventral mid brain and striatum of paraquat, pyridaben and paraquat+maneb mice models of Parkinson's disease.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-sequencing from ventral mid brain and striatum from paraquat, pyridaben and paraquat+maneb mice models of Parkinson's disease. We observed several differentially expressed genes upon pesticide exposure which we analyzed by pathway analysis.

DESIGN
We examined 3 replicates each for ventral mid brain and striatum per pesticide for RNA-Seq
