TITLE
Increased Longevity in the Insulin-sensitive Syntaxin 4 Transgenic Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
There is a good deal of indirect evidence that improved insulin sensitivity may contribute to improved lifespan of mice in which aging has been slowed by mutations, drugs, or dietary means, even in stocks of mice that do not show signs of late-life diabetes.  Peripheral responses to insulin can be augmented by over-expression of Syntaxin 4 (Syn4), a membrane SNARE protein.  We show here that Syn4 transgenic (Tg) mice live approximately 33% longer than controls, and show increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, even at ages where controls show age-related insulin resistance.  Hence, presumably Syn4 Tg mice spend more hours of each day under normoglycemic conditions, which may slow multiple aspects of aging and thereby extend lifespan, even in non-diabetic mice.

DESIGN
control vs. Syn4 transgenic (overexpression) mice
