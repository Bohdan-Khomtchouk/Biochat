TITLE
Transcription and Imprinting Dynamics in Developing Postnatal Male Germline Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Paternal imprinting initiates in primordial germ cells (PGCs), and is considered largely completed at birth.  The resulting postnatal spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) thenself-renew and proliferate to populate the testicular niche, with sexual maturation enabling productive gametogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of neonatal wild type (WT) mice testis were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 Examination of 2 different histone modifications in mouse spermatogonia Please note that ChIPSeq_Kitplus samples are samples isolated with MACS CD117 microbeads from Miltenyi and ChIPSeq_Kitminus are samples that were not positively selected for Kit.
