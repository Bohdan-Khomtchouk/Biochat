TITLE
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of H-2b AND-TCR-transgenic thymocytes and C57BL/6 thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Screening for mouse cDNA that was highly expressed in positive-selector H-2b AND-TCR-transgenic thymocytes using Affymetrix Murine Genome arrays. Keywords: transgenic  mouse

DESIGN
2 thymocytes, H-2b AND-TCR-transgenic thymocytes and C57BL/6 thymocytes, were analyzed by duplicate hybridization.
