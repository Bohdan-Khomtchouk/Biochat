TITLE
2.5D tubulogenesis

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Hepatocyte growth factor-induced three-dimensional tubulogenesis (3D) is a simple and highly controllable system for studying epithelial tubule initiation and maintenance. However, due to its limited efficiency and asynchronous development, isolating genes associated with specific morphological changes observed during tubule formation has been unfeasible. Here we report a significantly enhanced in vitro culture method called 2.5-dimensional tubulogenesis (2.5D). Detailed image analysis of 2.5D has revealed morphologically distinct stages -- monolayer, extension, and tubule -- and finds that these stages display in a highly synchronized manner. Using time-course transcriptional profiling, we collected genes whose expression changes specifically associate with extension and tubule stage.

DESIGN
Time-course microarrays to identify genes whose temporal regulation is associated with extension and tubule stages. Four biological replicates for each stage (monolayer, extension, and tubule).
