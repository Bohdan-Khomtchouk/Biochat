TITLE
Novel selective regulation of hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal, survival and proliferation by estrogens has therapeutic potential in myeloproliferative neoplasms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogens are potential regulators of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche and have effects on mature hematopoietic cells; however, whether estrogen signaling directly regulates normal and malignant HSC remains unclear. We demonstrate differential expression and specific roles of estrogen receptors (ER) in hematopoietic progenitors. ERa activation in short-term HSC and multipotent progenitors induced apoptosis. In contrast, the selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen induced proliferation of quiescent long-term HSC, altered their self-renewal signature and compromised hematopoietic reconstitution following myelotoxic stress. Treatment with tamoxifen alone abolished hematopoietic progenitor expansion induced by JAK2V617F by restoring normal levels of apoptosis, blocked JAK2V617F-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm in vivo, and sensitized MLL-AF9+ leukemias to chemotherapy. Tamoxifen showed selective effects on mutant cells compared to normal ones, and had only a minor impact on steady-state hematopoiesis in disease-free animals. These results uncover specific regulation of hematopoietic progenitors by estrogens and potential anti-leukemic properties of SERM

DESIGN
LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs and MPPs sorted from the bone marrow of mice treated with tamoxifen or vehicle (3 biological replicates per group)
