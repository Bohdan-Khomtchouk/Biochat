TITLE
Analysis of BAFF-mediated gene expression in primary CLL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BAFF ligand induces NF-kappaB activation in CLL cells

DESIGN
Primary CLL cells were cultured on BAFF-expressing stroma for 18 hours. Cells were lysed. RNA was prepared using standard techniques and submitted for gene expression profiling
