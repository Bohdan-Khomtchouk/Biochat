TITLE
Methylation Pattern of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation changes upon long-term culture and aging of MSC by using the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assessing 27,578 unique CpG sites. Cells were taken from bone marrow aspirates from iliac crest (BM) of healthy donors or from the caput femoris (HIP) of elderly patients that received femoral head prosthesis.Overall, the methylation pattern was maintained throughout both long-term culture and aging but highly significant differences were observed at specific CpG sites. Notably, methylation changes in MSC were related in long-term culture and aging in vivo.
