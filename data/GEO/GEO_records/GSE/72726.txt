TITLE
Chromatin Remodeler CHD7 mutated in CHARGE Syndrome Interacts with Sox10 to Regulate Timing of CNS Myelination and Remyelination [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in CHD7, encoding ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7, in CHARGE syndrome leads to multiple congenital anomalies including growth retardation, craniofacial malformations and neurological dysfunction. Currently, mechanisms underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Chd7 is a direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and Brg1 and required for proper timing of CNS myelination and remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses coupled with transcriptome profiling reveal that Chd7 cooperates with Sox10 to target the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes, and identify novel Chd7 target.
