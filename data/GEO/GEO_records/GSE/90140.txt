TITLE
Molecular reprogramming of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) clusters upon 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNA Seq and bioinformatic analysis are used to study what processes are important for the molecular reprogramming of GMPs after 5-FU treatment. Samples were collected at different time points (0, 8, 10, 12 and 14 days post treatment)

DESIGN
Single cell RNA sequencing of GMP cells upon 5-FU treatment

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
