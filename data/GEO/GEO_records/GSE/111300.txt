TITLE
Expression data from sorted mouse E17.5 lung ciliated cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We purified the differentiating ciliated cells from E17.5 mouse lungs and used Affymetrix microarrays to obtain their gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Ciliated cells were isolated by flow cytometry as GFP+ cells from FOXJ1-GFP mouse lungs at E17.5

PLATFORM
