TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of inflammation-related gene expression in endothelial cells activated by complement MASP-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, treated with MASP-1, thrombin, LPS, histamine, TNFalpha, MASP-1+SB203580 (p38-MAPK inhibitor) or MASP-1+Bay-117082 (NFKB inhibitor). Goal was to determine the effect of MASP-1 on HUVECs, to compare this with the effect of other endothelial cell activators and to determine the MASP-1 induced signalling pathways.

DESIGN
Two-color microarray experiment, with several different treatments. 13 samples were analyzed. 2h MASP-1 treatment: 4 biological replicates; TNFalpha treatment: 2 replicates; 1h MASP-1, 6h MASP-1, LPS, histamine, thrombin, SB203580, Bay-117082 treatment: 1-1 replicate
