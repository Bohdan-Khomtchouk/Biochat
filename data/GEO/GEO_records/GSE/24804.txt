TITLE
SNP data from 13 childhood adrenocortical tumours from Brazilian patients and 6 matched normal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP array data from 13 Brazilian childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) were analyzed to detect recurrent copy number changes and highlight potential candidate driver genes.

DESIGN
13 childhood ACT were analyzed with Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo v1.0 chips. Paired normal blood samples from 6 patients were analyzed with Illumina HumanCNV370-Quad v3.0 chips.
