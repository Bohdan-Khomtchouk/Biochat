TITLE
Expression data of colon cancer COLO320DM cells and tankyrase inhibitor-resistant variant 320-IWR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and is involved in CRC growth. Tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member, destabilizes Axin and positively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Tankyrase inhibitors efficiently suppress CRC cell proliferation. We established 320-IWR cells, which showed resistance to tankyrase inhibitor IWR-1, from human CRC COLO-320DM cells. We analyzed gene expression profile of 320-IWR cells (320IWR_1,_2) and parental COLO-320DM cells (COLO320_1,_2).

DESIGN
We continuously treated COLO-320DM cells with a tankyrase inhibitor IWR-1 and established a tankyrase inhibitor-resistant cell line, 320-IWR. We compared gene expression between COLO-320DM (COLO320_1,_2) and 320-IWR (320IWR_1,_2) cells.
