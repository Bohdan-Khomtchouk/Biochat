TITLE
Expression data from mouse livers of control mice (RECS1-flox) and hepatocyte specific RECS1 deficiency mice (RECS1-HKO) after fed with HFD for 8 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the potential mechanism by which RECS1 regulate metabolic disorder, we treated control mice and RECS1 HKO mice with HFD for 8 weeks, and performed microarray to identify the expression pattern and the potential important molecules regulated by RECS1. We used microarrays to detect the global gene expression in the livers of control mice and RECS1 HKO mice after treatment with HFD for 8 weeks and identified distinct classes of altered genes in the livers of mice upon HFD compared .

DESIGN
Eight weeks old control mice (n=3) and RECS1 HKO (n=3) were treated with HFD, and the livers were dissected after 8 weeks treatment.  Total RNA was extracted and a total of 400ng RNA was used following Affymetrix instruction. 3 biological samples for each genotype
