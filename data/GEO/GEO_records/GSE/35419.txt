SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the second leading cause of death from cancer in men. The molecular mechanisms driving prostate carcinogenesis are complex; with several lines of evidence suggesting that the re-expression of conserved developmental programs play a key role. Through conditional gene targeting and organ grafting, we describe conserved roles for the transcription factor Sox9 in the initiation of both prostate organogenesis and prostate carcinogenesis in murine models. Abrogation of Sox9 expression prior to the initiation of androgen signaling blocks the initiation of prostate development. Similarly, Sox9 deletion in two genetic models of prostate cancer (TRAMP and Hi-Myc) blocks cancer initiation. Expression profiling of Sox9-null prostate epithelial cells reveals that the role of Sox9 in the initiation of prostate development may relate to its regulation of multiple cytokeratins and/or calcium-related proteins. Due to its essential role in cancer initiation, manipulation of Sox9 targets in at-risk men may prove useful in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Sox9 differential gene expression in prostaspheres derived from the urogenital sinus epithelium was assessed by tow-colors direct comparisons of labeled moieties. Hybridizations were performed on the Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) Whole Mouse Genome DNA microarray (mgug4122a). Sox9 targets were assessed in murine prostate epithelial cells with targeted deletion.
