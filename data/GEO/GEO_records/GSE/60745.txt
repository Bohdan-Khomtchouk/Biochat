TITLE
14-3-3ζ controls adipocyte progenitor cell cycle and differentiation via Gli3-dependent p27Kip expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
14-3-3 proteins facilitate cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of transcription factors.Adipocyte differentiation requires the function of critical transcription factors to drive the development of a mature adipocyte. The aim of the study was to investigate if 14-3-3ζ is required for the adipogenic transcriptional program.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome in siCon- and si14-3-3ζ-transfected 3T3-L1 cells undergoing differentiation at t=0, 24, and 48 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
