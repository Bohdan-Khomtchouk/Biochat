TITLE
Effect of calcium depletion on cold induced gene expression in barley

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Agilent 44k barley microarray was used to screen calcium dependent cold induced genes. Calcium chelator (EGTA) or calcium channel blocker (lanthanum) or phospholipase C activator (mastoparan) pretreatments were performed to block/enhance calcium response in barley seedlings. Calcium depleted and control plants were cold treated and the difference in the gene expression was investigated.

DESIGN
Hordeum vulgare, L. cv. Nure / lower part (~1.5 cm) of the stem (hypocotyl and cotyledons) of 4-day-old seedlings / sampling: at 24 hours after the beginning of cold treatment, 2 biological replications per treatment, 15 individual plants per replication
