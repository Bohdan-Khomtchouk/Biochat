ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed expression profiles of microRNAs from 22 paired gastric cancer and normal tissues and identified differentially expressed microRNAs.

DESIGN
RNA from paired normal and tumor specimens in 22 gastric cancer patients were extracted and treated for microRNA microarray analysis.
