TITLE
Hepatic transcriptome response to glucocorticoid receptor activation in rainbow trout.

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Stress induced elevation in plasma cortisol levels is shown to be involved in the metabolic re-adjustments to stress but the genetic basis of this response is still unclear. Cortisol signaling in teleosts is thought to be mediated predominantly by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-bound transcription factor and previous studies have shown that RU486, a GR antagonist offsets corticosteroid signaling in teleosts. In order to elucidate the genetic basis of GR-mediated metabolic re-adjustments, we exposed in vitro primary culture of trout hepatocytes to cortisol (100 ng/ml; stressed levels) or RU486 (1000 ng/ml) or a combination of both (RU486 + Cortisol), and analyzed the transcriptional responses using a low density custom-made targeted trout cDNA array. These results were further validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Cortisol treatment significantly increased glucose production in hepatocytes and this response is blocked by RU486 suggesting the activation of GR-mediated corticosteroid signaling. Cortisol treatment significantly modulated the transcript abundance of several genes, previously shown to be involved in molecular and biochemical responses to stress and most of these effects are abolished by RU486, suggesting GR-mediated effects. In addition, cortisol treatment affected key genes involved in reproduction supporting previous findings on inhibitory effects of cortisol on reproduction. Taken together, our results provide evidence on the transcriptional changes involved in cortisol signaling in response to stress.
