TITLE
Astrocyte transcriptome from Mecp2-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) are responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome that is one of the most frequent sources of intellectual disability in women. It has been shown that mutant astrocytes contribute to neuronal defects, probably as a result of aberrant secretion of soluble factor(s). Based on the hypothesis that this irregular secretion of soluble factor is the result of abnormal transcription of those factors, we have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type and mutant astrocytes from Mecp2 308/y mice by using Affymetrix mouse 2.0 microarrays.

DESIGN
P0 newborns from pregnant Mecp2 308/+ heterozygous mice were used for the preparation of dissociated cortical astrocyte cultures. Four wild-type and four mutant confluent astrocytes cultures were used for total RNA extraction with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) as described by the manufacturer. The gene expression profiles of wild type and mutant astrocytes from Mecp2 308/y mice have been assayed by using Affymetrix mouse 2.0 microarrays.
