SUMMARY
Total pancreatic RNA was isolated from 3 week old NOD.scid, NOD, BDC2.5/NOD and BDC2.5/NOD.scid animals by GITC method. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 10ug total RNA. The data from NOD.scid, NOD, BDC2.5/NOD and BDC2.5/NOD.scid Affymetrix MGU74Av2 cel files was converted into Robust Multi Array (RMA) text file for analysis using GeneSpring 6.1 Keywords: other
