TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of ada2Δ, nrg1Δ and cir1Δ and KN99α wildtype cells in capsule inducing and non-inducing conditions

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
To contextualize the cryptococcal Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) member Ada2 in the capsule regulatory network, RNA-Seq was performed on wildtype, ada2Δ and two other transcription factors, nrg1Δ and cir1Δ, which like ada2Δ are also defective for capsule formation, virulence and filamentation.

DESIGN
Mutant and wildtype cells were grown in capsule inducing and non-inducing conditions for 90 minutes and transcriptional profiling was performed by RNA-Seq analysis.
