TITLE
Transcriptome study of rice early response to rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice blast disease is a major threat to rice production worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying rice resistance to the causal agent Magnaporthe oryzae remain elusive. In this whole-genome transcriptome study of rice early defense response to M. oryzae, we applied Affymetrix Rice Genome Genechip to compare the compatible and incompatible rice-M. oryzae interactions in 24 hours post-inoculation.
