TITLE
MicroRNAome of highly metastatic and non-metastatic human breast cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are noncoding, endogenous small RNAs that regulate target genes by cleavage of the targeted mRNA or translational repression. We investigated the microRNAome using 2-color microarrays in a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (sub line 4175) and a non-invasive breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. We found 13 miRNAs that were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated significantly in 4175 cells (p < 0.05, fold change > 2) compared with MCF10A cells.

DESIGN
We compared the highly metastatic human breast cell lines MDA-MB-231 (4175 subline)  with non-metastatic MCF10A cell lines. Two 4175 sublines and two MCF10A cell lines, independently grown and harvested. Dye swap was performed.
