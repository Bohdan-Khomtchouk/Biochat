TITLE
A natural plant derived compound, Withaferin A exploits the stress pathway to induce antitumor immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the global effect of plant derived compound Withaferin A on gene expression in rat her-2/neu expressing murine cancer cells at an early time point of 6hrs post treatment. Pathway analyses were performed to determine which metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the Withaferin A.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from rat her-2/neu cells treated with Withaferin A for 6hrs or untreated cells.
