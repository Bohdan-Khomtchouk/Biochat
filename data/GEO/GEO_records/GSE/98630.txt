TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of THP-1 cells on treatment with LL-37 and nano conjugated LL-37

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in THP-1 cells treated for 6 hours with CNT and GNP conjugated with LL-37, LL-37 spiked as well as free LL-37: Reference (Total RNA Mixture of all samples) vs. treated cells

DESIGN
Eight conditions of the expriment, Untreated THP-1 cells (NT) vs. treatment with free LL-37, nano conjugated LL-37, and nano materials spiked with LL-37 for 6 hours. Biological replicates: 3 in each case (Equal amount of total RNA from each replicate pulled together for microarray). Common reference for all groups.
