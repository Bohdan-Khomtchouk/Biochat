Genome-wide map of JMJD1C binding in Kasumi-1 cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The AML1-ETO fusion protein, a transcription factor generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), dictates a leukemic program by increasing self-renewal and inhibiting differentiation.  Here we demonstrate that the histone demethylase JMJD1C functions as a co-activator for AML1-ETO and is required for its transcriptional program. JMJD1C is directly recruited by AML1-ETO to its target genes and regulates their expression by maintaining low H3K9me2 levels. Analyses in JMJD1C knockout mice also establish a JMJD1C requirement for AML1-ETOâ€™s ability to increase proliferation. We also show a critical role for JMJD1C in the survival of multiple human AML cell lines, suggesting that it is required for leukemic programs in different AML cell types through its association with key transcription factors.

DESIGN
Examination of JMJD1C and LYL1 chromatin binding in Kasumi-1 cells, HL-60 cells, NB-4 cells and THP-1 cells,  including ChIP-seqs of JMJD1C  and LYL1, and input DNAs for Kasumi-1, HL-60, NB4.
