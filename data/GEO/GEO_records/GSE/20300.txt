TITLE
Whole blood gene expression analysis of stable and acute rejection pediatric kidney transplant patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Full title: Expression data from whole blood gene expression analysis of stable and acute rejection pediatric kidney transplant patients Tissues are often made up of multiple cell-types. Blood, for example, contains many different cell-types, each with its own functional attributes and molecular signature. In humans, because of its accessibility and immune functionality, blood cells have been used as a source for RNA-based biomarkers for many diseases.  Yet, the proportions of any given cell-type in the blood can vary markedly, even between normal individuals. This results in a significant loss of sensitivity in gene expression studies of blood cells and great difficulty in identifying the cellular source of any perturbations.  Ideally, one would like to perform differential expression analysis between patient groups for each of the cell-types within a tissue but this is impractical and prohibitively expensive.   This dataset is the validation dataset used to test the csSAM gene expression deconvolution algorithm as reported in the accompanying paper.

DESIGN
Whole blood gene expression measurements for 24 pediatric renal transplant patients were analyzed on human specific HGU133V2.0 (+) whole genome expression arrays. Blood drawn using PaxGene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX, Qiagen).
