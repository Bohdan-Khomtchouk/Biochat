TITLE
Genome-wide survey of YY1 targets in C2C12 cells by High-throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By applying ChIP-seq, we generated genome-wide maps of YY1 in skeletal myoblasts and myotubes. We found that YY1 binds to 1820 confident target with a large portion residing in the intergenic regions. In addition, YY1 was found to activate many loci, and there is no significant overlap between YY1 and Ezh2 targets, suggensting a Ezh2-independent manner. Further detailed study revealed that YY1 can regulate some lincRNAs which are fucntional in skeletal myogenesis. In this study, we identified a YY1-Yam-1-miR-715 (TF-lincRNA-miRNA) regulatory curcuit in myogensis.
