TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in equine endometrium at day 8 and 12 of pregnancy

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
In order to systematically analyze the maternal, i.e. the endometrial, changes in the equine endometrium underlying the complex embryo-maternal dialogue during early pregnancy, a transcriptome study of endometrium samples from five mares at day 8 and six mares at day 12 of early pregnancy and the corresponding non-pregnant stage was performed.

DESIGN
Endometrial biopsies were taken from six warmblood mares at day 12 of early pregnancy after embryo recovery and at the corresponding non-pregnant stage. 12 samples were analyzed: one pregnant sample and the corresponding control sample of every mare each at a time. Endometrial biopsies were taken from five warmblood mares at day 8 of early pregnancy after embryo recovery and at the corresponding non-pregnant stage. 10 samples were analyzed: one pregnant sample and the corresponding control sample of every mare each at a time. Two experimental groups: 8 and 12 days
