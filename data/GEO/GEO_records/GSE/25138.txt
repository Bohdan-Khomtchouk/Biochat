TITLE
Expression data from porcine adrenal gland

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa domesticus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the adrenal stress response, we analyzed differential mRNA expression of genes associated with stress induced by aggressive behaviour in the pig

DESIGN
In an animal experiment various levels of aggressive behaviour and stress were induced by mixing groups of unfamiliar pigs with different aggressiveness. To analyze adrenal stress response we selected two experimental groups for comparison, each comprising eight animals (n=16) which differed significantly in aggressive behaviour and plasma cortisol levels. To identify differentially expressed genes, we compared the adrenal transcriptome of these two groups of pigs, using the Affymetrix GeneChip porcine Genome Array.
