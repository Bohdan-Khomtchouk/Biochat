TITLE
Expression data from normal or DM1 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of changes in RNA steady-state levels between normal and DM1. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression differences in normal or DM1 myoblasts. Keywords: comparison

DESIGN
Two types of cells were analyzed, normal or DM1 deficient. The expression differences were compared to each other and we have deciphered a gene expression profile that is representative of DM1 deficiency.
