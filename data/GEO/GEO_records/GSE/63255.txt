TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the RNA polyemerase I trascription factor UBF1/2 binding in mouse and human cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-Seq analysis of the RNA polyemerase I trascription factor UBF1/2 in NIH3T3, HMEC and HMLER cell lines.

DESIGN
NIH3T3* samples: We correlated UBF1/2 binding across the genome with that of RNA polemerase I (Pol I), RNA polemerase II (Pol II) and chromatin states in NIH3T3 cells We perfromed ChIP-seq of UBF1/2 (2 biological replicates), Pol I (POLR1A/RPA194), Pol II, H3K9me3, H3K4Me3, H3K9ac, H4 hyperacetylation and genomic DNA input as reference. HMEC* samples: We report ChIP-Seq analysis of UBF1/2 and Pol I (POLR1A/RPA194) in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). In addition we include UBF1/2 ChIP-seq in the tumourigenic epithelial cell line HMLER.  In this study, we compared UBF1/2 binding in HMEC to UBF1/2 binding in in the tumorigenic HMLER cells, an isogenic HMEC-derived cell line expressing the SV40 large-T, TERT, and an oncogenic allele of the HRAS gene (expressing HRASV12G) that forms tumors in nude mice (Elenbaas et al., Gene & Development 2001) We sequenced UBF1/2 ChIP and Pol I(POLR1A/RPA194) ChIP and gDNA input from HMEC. We sequenced UBF1/2 ChIP and gDNA input from HMLER
