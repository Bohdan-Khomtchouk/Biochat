SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were performed on MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line treated with entinostast, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and doxorubicin as single, double, and triple combinations using Illumina.

DESIGN
Treatment signatures were made from each drug treatment and integrated to find a comprehensive view of changes associated with the epigenetic, differentiation and chemotherapy combination
