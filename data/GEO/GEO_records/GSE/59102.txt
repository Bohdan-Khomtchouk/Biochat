TITLE
HOX genes: potential candidates furthering the development of larynx squamous cell carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Larynx squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most aggressive cancer from head and neck (HSCC). Survival of LSCC patients has been found worsening, albeit significant advances in technology and therapeutics were made. We sought to clarify new genetic targets driven the development of LSCC. Analyzing tumors revealed that eight members of the homeobox gene family (HOX) were expressed 200 times more in LSCC samples than in normal larynx tissue. qPCR analysis validated all transcriptomic findings for the HOX gene family. Receiver Operating Characteristic statistical method (ROC curve) predicted that 8 members of the HOX gene family differentiate tumors from their normal surrounding tissue. Enabling the comparison of patient clinics with gene expression data, ROC curve analysis yet revealed that HOXC8 and HOXD11 genes are related to the tumor differentiation degree and regional lymph node metastasis, respectively. From siRNA assay, we found that HOXC8 and HOXD11 genes are essential for the expansion of FADU cell colonies. Our findings strongly suggest that members of the HOX family might be associated with the development of LSCC.

DESIGN
Twenty nine cancer samples and thirteen margin samples were collected from patients undergoing surgical ablation of LSCC according to Ethic Committee guideline and patient pre-informed signed consents. Whole human genome microarray analysis was applied to investigate new genetic targets in LSCC.
