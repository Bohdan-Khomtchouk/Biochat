TITLE
Progesterone Regulation of Extracellular Vesicles in the Uterine Luminal Fluid of Sheep (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Progesterone (P4) acts via the endometrium to modify the uterine environment and promotes conceptus growth for elongation and pregnancy establishment. Ewes were ovariectomized and treated with P4 for 14 days or P4 for 14 days and RU486, a progesterone receptor antagonist, from days 8 to 14. Interrogation of the endometrial transcriptome resulted in 1,611 differentially abundant transcripts with 931 increased and 680 decreased in P4 as compared to P4+RU treated ewes.

DESIGN
Endometrium from P4-treated (n=5) or P4+RU486-treated ewes (n=5)

PLATFORM
GPL22509 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Ovis aries)
