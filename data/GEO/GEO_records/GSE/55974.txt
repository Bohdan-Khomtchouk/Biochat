TITLE
LMKB/MARF1 localizes to mRNA processing bodies, interacts with Ge-1, and regulates IFI44L gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mRNA processing body is a cellular structure that regulates the stability of cytoplasmic mRNA.  MARF1/LMKB is an RNA-binding protein that is associated with maintenance of mRNA homeostasis and genomic stability.  To investigate the function of LMKB in a human B lymphocyte cell line, BJAB cells were treated with either control lentivirus or a lentivirus containing LMKB siRNA.

DESIGN
3 controls and 3 LMKB-KD samples

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
