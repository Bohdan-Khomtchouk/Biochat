TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of PRDM2 Knock down vs.controlGFPsh Quiescent C2C12 Myoblasts (G0 enriched)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Knockdown of PRDM2 led to precocious differentiation. To understand the molecular basis for this phenotype, we performed microaary analysis of quiescent myoblasts. Genes differentially regulated by PRDM2 knock down were reveraled by microarray analysis  using affymetrix mouse chips.

DESIGN
Control and knock down cells were synchronized at G0 by suspension culture and total RNA was used to perform microarray analysis
