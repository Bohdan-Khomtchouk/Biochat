TITLE
Generation of Mature Megakaryocytes from Pluripotent Stem Cells by a Chemically-Defined Transcription Factor-Based Forward Programming Approach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression data is used to compare the transcriptomics of hiPSC, hiPSC derived forward programmed-, hiPSC derived directed differentiated- megakaryoctes AND cord- blood derived megakaryocytes

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human induced plutipotent stem cells (hiPSC), megakaryocytes differentiated in vitro from haematopoetic stem cells obtained from cord blood and megakaryocytes differentiated from hiPSC

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
