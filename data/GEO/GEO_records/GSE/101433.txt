TITLE
Effect of the addition of corn DDGS and different sources of fat to the feedstuff of pigs on backfat transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptomes of the backfat from pigs obtaining different diet. Animals were divided into four feeding groups The diet  differed among groups in terms of the presence of corn DDGS  as well as the type of fat used.  We observed upregulation of several genes engaged in metabolism of lipids, fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis and  organization of lipid particles  in the samples from animals which did not obtain cDDGS in the feedstuff.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on 23 samples of backfat (7 samples -DDGS+rapeseed oil, 6 samples+DDGS+rapeseed oil, 5 samples +DDGS+beeftallow and 5 samples +DDGS+coconut oil) in two replicates on Illumina HiScanSQ 2000

PLATFORM
GPL21186 Illumina HiScanSQ (Sus scrofa)
