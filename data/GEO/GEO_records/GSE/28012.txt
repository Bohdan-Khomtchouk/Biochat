TITLE
Whole-Genome Analysis of SSB Larvae Infestation Regulated Rice Genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice, the worldâ€™s most important food crop, is attacked by multiple herbivores and pathogens.the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis is one of another most important rice insect pests. Here, we use Affymetrix Whole-Genome rice arrays to detect SSB infestation responsive genes.

DESIGN
RNA samples from five damaged stems of SSB-challenged 24 h rice plants or five stems from unchallenged plants (for control samples) were used to array analysis. Two replicate biological experiments of SSB treatment rice arrays and one control samples array were peformed.
