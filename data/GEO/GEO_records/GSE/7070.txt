TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Chlamydophila pneumoniae during the acute and iron mediated persistent infection

ORGANISM
Chlamydia pneumoniae

SUMMARY
The obligate intracellular, gram-negative bacterium, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Cpn), has impact as an acute and chronic disease-causing pathogen. Little is known about changes in the Cpn transcriptome during its biphasic developmental cycle (the acute infection) and persistence stages that are linked to chronic diseases. To analyze Cpn CWL029 gene expression, we designed a pathogen-specific oligo microarray and optimized the extraction method for pathogen RNA. Throughout the acute infection, ratio expression profiles for each gene were generated using 48 hours post infection as a reference. Based on these profiles, significantly expressed genes were separated into 12 expression clusters using SOM clustering and manually into the ‘early’, ‘mid’, ‘late’ and ‘tardy’ cluster classes. The latter two were differentiated because the ‘tardy’ class showed steadily increasing expression at the end of the cycle. The transcriptome of the Cpn elementary body (EB) and published EB proteomics data were compared to the cluster profile of the acute infection. We found an intriguing association between ‘late’ genes and genes coding for EB proteins, whereas ‘tardy’ genes were mainly associated with genes coding for EB mRNA. It has been published that iron depletion leads to Cpn persistence. We compared the gene expression profiles during iron depletion-mediated persistence with the expression clusters of the acute infection. This led to the finding that establishment of iron depletion-mediated persistence is more likely a mid-cycle arrest in development rather than a completely distinct gene expression pattern. Taken together, here we describe the Cpn transcriptome during the acute infection with ‘late’ genes correlating to EB proteins and ‘tardy’ genes to EB mRNA. Expression profiles during iron mediated-persistence led us to propose the hypothesis that the transcriptomic ‘clock’ is arrested during acute mid-cycle.
