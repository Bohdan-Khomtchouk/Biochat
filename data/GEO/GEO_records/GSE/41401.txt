TITLE
Responses of Monocytes derived macrophages from TB-infected and TB-free cattles to in vitro M.bovis challenge

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Macrophages from cattles with different infectious status of bovine tuberculosis have different responses to in vitro Mycobacterium bovis challenge. This is confirmed in our previous study exploring several immune-related genes using qPCR. Microarrays can help us better understand the differences by screening thousands of genes.

DESIGN
Monocytes Derived Macrophages from 3 TB-infected cattles and 3 TB-free cattles were challenged with Mycobacterium bovis at a MOI of 10 at 6 hours, and the control group were the same unchallenged macrophages at 6 hours.
