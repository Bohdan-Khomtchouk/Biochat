TITLE
Gene expression study in choroid plexus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes one of the blood–brain barriers – the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is formed by a monolayer of epithelial cells located within the brain ventricles and in addition to be responsible for the formation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is ideally positioned to transmit signals into and out of the brain. Specifically, here, we evaluated the overall kinetic response of the mouse CP to peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is the Gram-negative bacteria cell wall. This study shows that as soon as 1h after the injection, the CP responds by altering the expression of several genes. This response reaches a maximum at 3h and returns to the basal profile for most of the transcripts at 72h. To do this analysis we compared the CP transcriptome of LPS injected animals with the CP transcriptome of saline injected animals and using this we also dissect the CP basal transcriptome. From this analysis we confirm that the genes most highly expressed were those implicated in energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) and in ribosomal function, which is in agreement with the secretory nature of the CP. Finally, we also describe genes not previously identified as being expressed in the basal CP.

DESIGN
Gene expression study in choroid plexus. Time series after acute LPS treatment
