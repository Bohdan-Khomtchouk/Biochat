TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression after tyrosine or methionine/cysteine deprivation in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Limitation of essential amino acids, such as tyrosine or methionine/cysteine, causes upregulation of exogenous integrated transgene expression in mammalian cells. This phenomenon is mediated by histone acetylation and chromatin remodelling, since histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reproduce starvation-induced transgene upregulation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of amino acid-deprived cells reveals significant changes in total core histones detectable at the CMV promoter. Expression profiling of HeLa cells starved for 5 days in medium without tyrosine or methionine/cysteine provides important information on the cellular response to amino acid deprivation and suggests the involvement of HDAC4 (class II HDAC) in transgene derepression during amino acid starvation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HeLa and HeLaOA1myc cells (HeLa cells with a human ocular albinism type 1 (OA1)+myc tag transgene) subjected to 5 days of tyrosine or methionine/cysteine starvation compared to control cells. Twelve samples are analyzed: HeLa and HeLaOA1myc grown for 5 days in RPMI deprived of tyrosine (Y) vs. complete RPMI; technical duplicates of HeLa and HeLaOA1myc grown for 5 days in DMEM deprived of methionine/cysteine (MC) vs. complete DMEM.
