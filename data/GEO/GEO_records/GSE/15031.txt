TITLE
Profiling of spatio-temporally regulated transcripts during cerebral corticogenesis in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cerebral cortex plays an important role in cognitive function and specialized perception in mammals and its development requires highly specific spatio-temporal control of gene expression. The study identified stage- and region-specific markers throughout cerebral corticogenesis at various important stages of cerebral cortex development; embryonic day (E) 15.5, E17.5, postnatal day (P) 1.5 and 4-6 months old.

DESIGN
The study involved the analysis of 12 SAGE libraries, which were generated from the mouse cerebral cortex of E15.5 (n=3), E17.5 (n=2), P1.5 (n=1) and 4-6 month old (n=6). N denotes biological replicates.
