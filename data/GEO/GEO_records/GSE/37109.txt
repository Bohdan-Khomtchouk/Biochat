TITLE
Microarray analyses for wild type and Mof knockout murine ES cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Affy based microarray technology for profiling of gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells with or without histone acetytransferase MOF. We find that Mof regulates a wide range of genes in mouse ESCs including those important for ESC pluripotency and ESC differentiation. Mof deletion leads to similar number of genes that are up or down regulated. This study provides a framework for understanding the function of Mof in regulating ESC core transcription network.

DESIGN
Compare gene expression difference in two cell lines
