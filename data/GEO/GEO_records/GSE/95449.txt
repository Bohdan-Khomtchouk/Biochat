TITLE
Experience-dependent Epigenomic Reorganization in the Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further investigate epigenetic regulation of memory, we utilized whole-genome sequencing tools to systematically characterize memory-related changes in gene expression and DNA methylation status following memory acquisition.

DESIGN
Experience-dependent alternations in gene expression and DNA methylation in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats were observed 1 hr and 24 hr after contextual threat recognition training.
