TITLE
Global gene expression in response to SARS mouse adapted variants MA-15, MA-15epsilon, and MA-15-gamma in young and aged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose of this experiment was to study the host-transcriptional response to MA-15, MA-15epsilon, and MA-15-gamma in both young and aged mice to further understand the differences between response within each age group, and the age-related differences in response to each virus.

DESIGN
Young (8 weeks old) and aged (1 year old) female BALB/c mice were  intranasally infected with 10^5 PFU of either MA15, MA15 gamma, MA15 epsilon, or phosphate buffer solution (PBS; mock-infection). Lungs from aged mice were harvested at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-infection. Lungs from young mice were harvested at 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-infection.  For the aged mice, 3 biological replicates were collected for microarray analysis at each time point from the infected groups. 3 mocks at 12h, 2 mocks each at 24 and 48h time points.For the young mice, 4 biological replicates were collected for microarray analysis at each time point from the infected groups.
