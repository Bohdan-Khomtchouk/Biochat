TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the oxygen response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118 under wine fermentation conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118

SUMMARY
Oxygen additions play a critical role in winemaking. However, few studies have focused on how this oxygen affects yeast metabolism and physiology in wine making conditions. We performed microarrays to unveil the oxygen response in wine making conditions.

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from  nitrogen-limited chemostats, simulating wine making conditions, sparged with nitrogen and 1%, 5% and 20% oxygen-nitrogen mixtures, at different flux regimes, to achieve different dissolved oxygen levels representative of those found during wine making. These correspond to 0, 1.2, 2.7, 5 and 21 micromolar dissolved oxygen
