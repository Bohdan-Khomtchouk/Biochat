TITLE
Molecular basis for the specification of floral organs by APETALA3 and PISTILLATA (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Characterization of the activities of the transcription factors that AP3 and PI encode throughout flower development using perturbation and ChIPSeq assays in combination with a floral induction system (FIS) that allows a stage-specific analysis of flower development.

DESIGN
Examination of genomic regions bound by fully functional AP3-GFP and PI-GFP proteins at approx floral stage 4-5 as compared to a negative control sample

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
