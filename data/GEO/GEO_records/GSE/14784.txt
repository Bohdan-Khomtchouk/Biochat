TITLE
GATA3 overexpression in utricle sensory epithelia

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The inner ear utilizes sensory hair cells as mechano-electric transducers for sensing sound and balance. In mammals, these hair cells lack the capacity for regeneration. Unlike mammals, hair cells from non-mammalian vertebrates, such as birds, can be regenerated throughout the life of the organism making them a useful model for studying inner ear genetics pathways. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA3 is required for inner ear development and mutations cause sensory neural deafness in humans. In the avian cochlea GATA3 is expressed throughout the sensory epithelia; however, expression is limited to the striola of the utricle. The striola corresponds to an abrupt change in morphologically distinct hair cell types and a 180Â° shift in hair cell orientation. We used 3 complimentary approaches to identify potential downstream targets of GATA3 in the avian utricle. Specifically we used microarray expression profiling of GATA3 knockdown by siRNA and GATA3 over-expression treatments as well as direct comparisons of GATA3 expressing cells from the striola and non GATA3 expressing cells from the extra-striola.

DESIGN
Dissociated sensory epithelia were plated in 96 well cultures, 5 wells per sample. 4 days post plating, ~ 30% confluency, cells were transfected with a pMES vector containing an internal ribosome entry site regulating expression of GATA3 and eGFP under control of a chick beta-actin promoter. Controls were transfected with a vector containing EGFP only.  There are 2 biological samples and experiments include technical replicates as well as dye-switches for a total of 8 microarrays.
