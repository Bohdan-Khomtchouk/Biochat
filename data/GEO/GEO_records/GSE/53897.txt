TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) gene expression after morphine or oxycodone treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analyse of gene expression modification after chronic analgesic treatment. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that oxycodone and morphine induced gene expression modification. Results provide important information to understand the analgesic effects of oxycodone as compared to morphine in a neuropathic pain model

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from DRG of neuropathic or control animals after oxycodone or morphine treatment

PLATFORM
