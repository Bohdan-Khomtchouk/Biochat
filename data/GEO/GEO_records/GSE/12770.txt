SUMMARY
We tested four gene enrichment and complexity reduction target preparation methods for scoring SFPs on the Affymetrix GeneChip 18k Maize Genome Array (Maize GeneChip).  Methylation filtration (MF), Cot filtration (CF), mRNA-derived cRNA, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods were applied to three diverse maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17, and CML69) with three replications per line (36 Maize GeneChips).    Due to large amounts of repetitive, mobile DNA, the maize genome requires a target preparation method that offers both a high level of gene enrichment and accurate scoring of SFPs. The objectives of this research are (i) to determine which target preparation method (CF, MF, mRNA, or AFLP) optimally  enriches for gene sequences complementary to probe sequences on the Affymetrix GeneChip Maize Genome Array and (ii) to estimate SFP detection power for each target method.    The AFLP technology is covered by patents, and patent applications owned by Keygene N.V. AFLP is a registered trademark of Keygene N.V. GeneChip.
