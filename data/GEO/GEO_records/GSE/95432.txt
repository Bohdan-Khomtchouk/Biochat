TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of 186 basal and luminal epithelial cells from the mammary gland of adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary glands of 8 adult (10 week-old) female mice were collected. Freshly sorted basal and luminal epithelial cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. Cells were visualized under the microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit and sequencing was carried out on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 to achieve 100bp paired-end reads.

DESIGN
96 basal and 90 luminal cells were profiled from 8 mice.

PLATFORM
