The effect of chronic Rapamycin on the transcriptome of old mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of gene expression in the livers of old mice (25 months of age) fed rapamycin chronically (21 months) from 4 months of age.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from livers of 25 month old C57BL6/J male and female mice started on control or 14 ppm rapamycin (Rapa) from 4 months of age on 21 months of treatment. Number of samples total: 69, with 19 samples in Control males, 13 samples in Rapa males, 16 samples in Control Females, and 21 samples in Rapa Females
