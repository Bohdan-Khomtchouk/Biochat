TITLE
Gene expression atlas for mouse olfactory sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of all genes expressed by mouse olfactory sensory neurons; genes expressed in mature neurons, immature neurons, or both were distinguished.  Independent validation of enrichment ratio values supported by statistical assessment of error rates was used to build a database of statistical probabilities of the expression of all mRNAs detected in mature neurons, immature neurons, both types of neurons (shared), and the residual population of all other cell types.

DESIGN
FACS was used to separate a highly GFP+++ sample enriched in immature neurons, a weakly GFP+ sample slightly enriched in mature neurons, and a GFP- sample that contained all cell types in the olfactory epithelium but depleted of immature neurons.
