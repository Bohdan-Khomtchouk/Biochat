TITLE
Transcriptomic Profiling of Collaborative Cross Founder Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts stimulated with Type I, II and III Interferons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse embryonic fiborolasts (MEF) cells obtained from the eight Founder animals [PWK/PhJ, NZO/HILtJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, WSB/EiJ, A/J, CAST, C57BL/6J, and 129/SvlmJ] were immortalized and the cell lines used to assess differences in transcriptional responses following treatment with type I, II and III recombinant mouse interferon.

DESIGN
We collected transcriptome profiles for 8 CC MEF cell lines stimulated with either IFN-α or IFN-β for a total of 16 different biological conditions. Treated and mock samples were collected at 18 hr post-treatment and RNAs extracted and subjected to microarray.

PLATFORM
