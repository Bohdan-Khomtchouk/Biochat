TITLE
Ly6Chi monocytes in the inflamed colon give rise to pro-inflammatory effector cells and migratory antigen presenting cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We showed different function of monocyte derived cells in the lamina propria of the colon under steady state and inflammatory conditions. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct clusters of  regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Different subsets of mononuclear phagocytes were sorted from the colonic lamina propria as well as the spleen. Sorting was done in C57BL/6 mice in steady state and under inflammatory conditions (Dextran Sodium Sulphate induced colitis model)
