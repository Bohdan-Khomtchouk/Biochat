TITLE
LPS-induced gene expression in wildtype and MAL knockout mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in WT and MAL knockout (MALKO) mouse macrophages treated with 10ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with that of mock-treated cells incubated for the same time (10 days). Cells from 4 mice of each genotype were used and each individual served as its own control. Hybridizations of treated and control samples were dye swapped.

DESIGN
Two experiments: WT vs. LPS-treated WT, and MALKO vs. LPS-treated MALKO.  4 individual biological replicates for each genotype, and each mouse served as its own mock control.
