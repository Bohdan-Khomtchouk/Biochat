TITLE
sRNA profiling between the 7B-1 male-sterile tomato and its wild type in response to abiotic stress

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The RNA-seq was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between a male sterile and wild type tomato seedlings in response to abiotic stress

DESIGN
Two small RNA libraries were constructed from male-sterile and wild type tomato flower buds using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit from Illumina, and were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2000
