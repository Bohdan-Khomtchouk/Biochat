TITLE
High fat diet-induced changes of mouse hepatic transcription and enhancer activity can be reversed by subsequent weight loss

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this setup we have used RNA-seq, DHS-seq, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq to identify changes in transcription, chromatin landscape and enhancer activity in livers of mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and mice returned from HFD to Chow.

DESIGN
Global gene expression analysis, DHS-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq in livers of 7 week old mice fed chow or  HFD. Furthermore, we have performed global gene expression analysis and H3K27ac ChIP-seq in 12 week old mice initially fed HFD then returned to chow or continued chow diet.
