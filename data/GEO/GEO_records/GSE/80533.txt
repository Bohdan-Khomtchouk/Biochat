TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of FOXO1 binding features in early stage of chicken myoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) were performed for FOXO1 in early differentiated myoblasts. Based on FOXO1-occupied features, 234 coding genes were annotated including 39 targets overlapped with mouse ChIP-seq data. Function analysis demonstrated that these targets were enriched in myogenic proliferation, death and hypotrophy. Moreover, FOXO1 manipulated myoblast proliferation through promoting TGFBR2 and MYCN and repressing G0S2 at transcriptional level. On the other side, FOXO1 negatively regulated Bcl6 expression in myoblast, indicating that in the early stage of differentiation, myoblast apoptosis induced by miR-16 might be coordinated by impacts of FOXO1 on Bcl6.

DESIGN
More than 10^8 differentiated myoblast cells  were used for constructed two DNA sequencing libraries (ChIP and input) performed by HiSeq2000 system (Illumina).
