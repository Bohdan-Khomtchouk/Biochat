TITLE
mRNA expression profiles in Wilms tumor subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify differentially expressed mRNAs in different Wilms tumor subtypes and correlate them to miRNA expression profiles of the same tumor samples.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA expression profiles in Wilms tumor of different subtypes (total n=28) compared to normal kidney tissue (n=4)
