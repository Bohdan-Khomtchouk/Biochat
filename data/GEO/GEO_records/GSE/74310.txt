TITLE
Single-cell chromatin accessibility data using scATAC-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A single hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to all blood cells with remarkable fidelity. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscape controlling this process in thirteen primary cell types that traverse the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that enhancer landscapes better reflect cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable " enhancer cytometry " for accurate enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We further reveal the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia, chromatin accessibility reveals distinctive regulatory evolution in pre-leukemic HSCs (pHSCs), leukemia stem cells, and leukemic blasts. These leukemic cells demonstrate unique lineage infidelity, confirmed by single cell regulomes. We further show that pHSCs have a competitive advantage that is conferred by reduced chromatin accessibility at HOXA9 targets and is associated with adverse patient outcomes. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into human hematopoietic development and disease.
