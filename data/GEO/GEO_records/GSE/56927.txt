TITLE
A novel action mechanism for MPT0G013, a derivative of arylsulfonamide, inhibits tumor angiogenesis through up-regulaiton of TIMP3 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) were originally characterized as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), acting as potent antiangiogenic proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that the arylsulfonamide derivative MPT0G013 has potent antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo via inducing TIMP3 expression. Treatments with MPT0G013 significantly inhibited endothelial cell functions, such as cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as induced p21 and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Subsequent microarray analysis showed significant induction of TIMP3 gene expression by MPT0G013, and siRNA-mediated blockage of TIMP3 up-regulation abrogated the antiangiogenic activities of MPT0G013 and prevented inhibition of p-AKT and p-ERK proteins. Importantly, MPT0G013 exhibited antiangiogenic activities in in vivo Matrigel plug assays, inhibited tumor growth and up-regulated TIMP3 and p21 proteins in HCT116 mouse xenograft models. These data suggest potential therapeutic application of MPT0G013 for angiogenesis-related diseases such as cancer.
