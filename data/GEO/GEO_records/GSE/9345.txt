TITLE
NIA15k screen.  Pax5 +/+, Pax5 -/-, and Rag1-/- pro B cell lines.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Pax5 is essential for B cell commitment in the mouse, where it represses lineage-inappropriate gene expression, while simultaneously activating the B cell gene expression program. We have performed a global gene expression screen of wild type and Pax5-deficient pro-B cells in an attempt to identify the crucial Pax5 targets in early B-lymphopoiesis. We have also included Rag1-/- and wild type (+/+) proB cells starved of the cytokine IL-7 for 4 hours as controls. Rag1-/- proB cells are incapable of further differentiation due to an absence of immunoglobulin recombination and IL-7 is the major cytokine regulating proB cell growth. Keywords: comparison of genetically modified cell-lines

DESIGN
Twelve arrays were used to compare a single Pax5+/+ proB cell line grown in the presence or abscence of IL-7 for 4 hours.  3 independently derived Pax5-/- proB cells lines and a single Rag1-/- pro B cell line were also analysed. cDNA were hybridised  in a saturated loop design using dye swaps for each comparison, such that all samples were compared twice.
