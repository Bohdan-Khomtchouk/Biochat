TITLE
The SLE transcriptome exhibits evidence of chronic endotoxin exposure and has widespread dysregulation of non-coding and coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized next generation sequencing of transcripts (RNA-seq) to characterize the SLE transcriptome in monocytes.This is the first RNA-seq study of SLE using clinical subjects and we found a transcriptome that exhibits quantitative alterations as defined by the level of gene expression but also qualitative differences with widely altered splicing preference and non-coding RNA transcription.

DESIGN
total RNA from 8 heathy controls and 9 SLE patients were used to RNA sequence and comparision the whole transcriptome alteration

PLATFORM
GPL9442 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Homo sapiens)
