TITLE
Genome wide mapping of NFAT1 binding sites in dendritic cells and of chromatin state in steady and dectin-1 activated dendritic cell line D1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse dendritic cells in steady and dectin-1 activated with or without NFAT inhibitor FK506. We found the differential H3K4me3 signatures in these cells. This study provides the epigenetic signatures of steady, dectin-1activated with or without NFAT inhibition. We also generated stable dendritic cell line D1 expressing a V5 tagging NFAT1. This cell line was used to map the global binding sites of NFAT1 upon dectin-1 activation with 10ug/ml curdlan for 30 minutes.

DESIGN
examine NFAT1-v5 genome wide binding sites and differential H3K4me3 epigenetic modification in steady, dectinn-1 activated with or without NFAT inhibiton.
