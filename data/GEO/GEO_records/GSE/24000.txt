TITLE
Gene expression profiles of ALL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using using ATLAS cDNA expression arrays, we performed gene expression profiling of primary leukemia cells from 31 infants and 30 non-infant children (pediatric patients) with ALL to determine if any of these signature genes are differentially expressed in infant ALL vs. pediatric ALL.  Reduced expression levels of 6 of the 9 CD22deltaE12 signature genes that were represented on the human cDNA arrays, including TP53 and APC as well as MDM2, SATB1, CCNG1 and GNB2 discriminated infant BPL from non-infant BPL.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from primary ALL cells and human ATLAS c DNA expression arrays were used for gene expression profiling.
