TITLE
Gene expression profile of murine tolerant, self-antigen specific CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomewide microarray analysis of murine tolerant, self-antigen specific CD8 T cells to identify genes and pathways underlying peripheral T cell tolerance Gene signature of tolerant CD8 T cells was compared to the signatures of naïve T cells, memory T cells, rescued T cells (=tolerant T cells undergoing homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic, tolerogenic Alb:GAG mice), and re-tolerized T cells (=previously rescued T cells post homeostatic proliferation isolated from lymphoreplete wild-type B6 mice).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from various sort-purified transgenic CD8 T cell subsets (naïve, memory, tolerant, rescued, and re-tolerized) isolated from spleens of different host mice

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
