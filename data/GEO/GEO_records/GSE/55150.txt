TITLE
Desmoplastic Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High resolution aCGH was performed on 10 primary Desmoplastic Melanomas (DMs). DMs are a rare subtype of melanoma known for their pronounced desmoplastic stroma and spindled melanocytes. 10 samples were hybridized to Agilent 1 Million feature two color arrays as compared to a panel of normal male DNA. 6 samples were hybridized to Agilent 244K feature two color arrays as compared to a panel of normal male DNA. 34 samples were hybridized to Agilent 180K feature two color arrays as compared to a panel of normal male DNA.

DESIGN
50 unique primary tumors were hybridized compared to normal male DNA.
