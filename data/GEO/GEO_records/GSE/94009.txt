TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide occupancy of menin in T47D and MCF-10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq using antibodies directed at menin in T47D and MCF-10A cells in order to assess the genome-wide presence of menin in these cells.

DESIGN
T47D cells were synchronized in phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (CDT medium). MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM. Menin ChIP-seq was performed.
