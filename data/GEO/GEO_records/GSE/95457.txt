TITLE
Identifying genomic loci exhibiting chromatin decompaction upon loss of MORC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the Differential Viral Integration (DIVA) technique to compare chromatin accessibility in wild-type versus MORC2 knockout HeLa cells.

DESIGN
DIVA analysis of wild-type HeLa cells compared to MORC2 knockout HeLa cells.

PLATFORM
