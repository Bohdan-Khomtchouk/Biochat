TITLE
Pupylated proteins in Corynebacterium glutamicum revealed by MudPIT analysis

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
In a manner similar to ubiquitin, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) has been shown to target proteins for degradation via the proteasome in mycobacteria. However, not all actinobacteria possessing the Pup protein also harbor a proteasome, suggesting fates for pupylated proteins other than degradation via a proteasome or degradation at all. In the present study we set out to study pupylation in the proteasome-lacking non-pathogenic model microorganism and biotechnological workhorse Corynebacterium glutamicum. A defined pup deletion mutant of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 grew as the control indicating that pupylation seems to be dispensable under the conditions tested. By expression of homologous Pup carrying a poly-histidine tag in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 we purified the first pupylome of a microorganism lacking a proteasome. Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) unraveled 54 proteins being pupylated in this organism. Similar to mycobacteria, the majority of pupylated proteins in C. glutamicum can be classified as enzymes of the metabolism or as involved in translation. These results help to elucidate the common target pathways of pupylation in bacteria.

DESIGN
Sample 1: For growth in CGXII minimal media, a preculture 1 was grown in 5 ml BHI medium inoculated with a single colony from a fresh BHI agar plate and incubated at 170 rpm for 8 hours. Then 500 µl of preculture 1 were used to inoculate preculture 2 in 100 ml shake flasks with 20 ml CGXII minimal medium containing 4 % (w/v) glucose and incubated over night (140 rpm , 30 °C ). Subsequent main cultures (50 ml CGXII medium with 4 % glucose) were inoculated with cells from preculture 2 to an OD600 of about 0.4. For DNA microarray  analysis, cells were harvested in the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 4 to 5. After extraction of total RNA 25µg of total RNA from C. glutamicum Delta-pup and C. glutamicum WT were compared in two-color microarray analysis. Overall three biological replicates were done. Sample 2-4: For growth in CGXII minimal media, a preculture 1 was grown in 5 ml BHI medium inoculated with a single colony from a fresh BHI agar plate and incubated at 170 rpm for 8 hours. Then 500 µl of preculture 1 were used to inoculate preculture 2 in 100 ml shake flasks with 20 ml CGXII minimal medium containing 4 % (w/v) glucose and incubated over night (140 rpm , 30 °C ). Subsequent main cultures (50 ml CGXII medium with 4 % glucose) were inoculated with cells from preculture 2 to an OD600 of about 0.4. For growth experiments in complex BHI medium, 20 ml brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) were inoculated with a single colony from a fresh BHI agar plate and incubated at 140 rpm as overnight cultures. Subsequent main cultures (50 ml BHI medium) were inoculated with cells from overnight cultures to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of about 1. For DNA microarray  analysis, cells were harvested in the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 4 to 5. After extraction of total RNA 25µg of total RNA from C. glutamicum Delta-pup and C. glutamicum WT were compared in two-color microarray analysis.  Overall three biological replicates were done for each growth medium. Sample 5-6: For growth experiments in complex BHI medium, 20 ml brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) were inoculated with a single colony from a fresh BHI agar plate and incubated at 140 rpm as overnight cultures.
