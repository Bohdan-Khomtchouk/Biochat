TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RNAs isolated from TPEN-untreated and TPEN-treated human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the zinc responsive genes, we performed a gene expression microarray analysis for the RNAs isolated from TPEN-untreated and TPEN-treated human keratinocytes

DESIGN
Duplicate experiments were performed for TPEN-untreated and TPEN-treated human keratinocytes. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Qiazol (QIAGEN) following the manufacturersâ€™ protocols.
