TITLE
Transcriptomics adaptation of porcine adipose- and bone marrow-derived stem cells during adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Adipose-derived and bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were collected from 3 pigs and cultivated in vitro up to 3 passages. At passage 3 cells were cultured to 80% confluence and induced to differentiate in adipose and bone. Cell were harvested at 0 day of differentiation (dd) or pre-differentiation, at 2, 7, and 21dd for RNA extraction. The RNA was used for a large microarray analysis using a specific pig oligo-array with > 10,000 annotated genes. The main aim of the  microarray analysis was to directly compare the two transcriptomics adaptation of the two mesenchymal stem cells during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation

DESIGN
The mesenchymal stem cells were harvested at 0, 2, 7, and 21 day of differentiation (dd). A dye-swap reference design (reference =  mixture of RNA from several porcine tissues) was used.
