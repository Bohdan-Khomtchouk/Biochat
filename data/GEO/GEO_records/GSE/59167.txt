TITLE
The CLE40 and CRN/CLV2 signaling pathways antagonistically control root meristem growth in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Differentiation processes in the primary root meristem are controlled by several signaling pathways that are regulated by phytohormones or by secreted peptides. Long term maintenance of an active root meristem requires that the generation of new root meristem cells and the loss of cells from the meristem due to differentiation is precisely coordinated. Via phenotypic and large scale transcriptome analyses of mutants, we show that the signalling peptide CLE40 and the receptor proteins CLV2 and CRN act in two genetically separable pathways that antagonistically regulate cell differentiation in the proximal root meristem. CLE40 inhibits cell differentiation throughout the primary root meristem by controlling genes with roles in abscisic acid, auxin and cytokinin signalling. CRN and CLV2 jointly control target genes that promote cell differentiation specifically in the transition zone of the proximal root meristem. While CRN and CLV2 are not acting in the CLE40 signaling pathway under normal growth conditions, both proteins are required when the levels of CLE40 or related CLE peptides increase. We show here that two antagonistically acting pathways controlling root meristem differentiation can be activated by the same peptide in a dosage dependent manner.
