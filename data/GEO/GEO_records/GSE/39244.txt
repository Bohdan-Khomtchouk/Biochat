TITLE
Siah2-dependent gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed to identify Siah2-dependent changes in cells subjected to ER stress, hypoxia, and combined glucose/oxygen deprivation.  To establish the magnitude of the Siah2 effect on the ER stress response, we have compared gene expression profiles of WT and Siah1a-/-::Siah2-/-  mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) that were subjected to glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (TM), thapsigargin (TG), glucose deprivation, or glucose/oxygen deprivation.  Overall, this analysis confirmed changes associated with ER stress that had not previously been associated with Siah2 signaling, substantiating Siah2 as a key coordinator of ER stress through the ATF4 and sXbp1 pathways.

DESIGN
WT and Siah1a/Siah2 KO MEF cells were treated with TM or TG for 6 h, or subjected for 12 h to oxygen deprivation, glucose deprivation or a combination of oxygen and glucose deprivation, in duplicate.
