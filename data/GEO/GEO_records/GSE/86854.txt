TITLE
Whole genome transcriptome analysis of serotype M1 Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) wild type and isogenic FabT mutants grown at 35C and 40C.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
The goal was to perform global transcriptome analysis on isogenic wild type 2221 and FabT deletion mutant M1 strains to investigate how inactivation of the fabT gene affects gene expression.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of 2 M1 GAS strains, one wild type MGAS221 strain and one isogenic MGAS2221 fabT deletion mutant strain, were compared at two phases of growth, mid-exponential and early-stationary, and at two temperatures, 35C and 40C, using 3 biologial replicates, to identify transcriptome changes. The fatty acid biosynthesis transcriptional regulator gene, fabT, was the most frequently mutated gene of the MGAS2221 geneome in isolates recovered from a NHP necrotizing fasciitis model of infection.
