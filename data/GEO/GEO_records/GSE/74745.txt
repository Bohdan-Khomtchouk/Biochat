TITLE
Expression data from brown planthhoper (BPH) infested and non-infested rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
KMD is genetically engenered to be highly resistant to lepidopteran pests through expressing a synthetic cry1Ab gene and its parent non-transgenic rice is Xiushui 11.The developmental duration of BPH feeding on  KMD2 was significantly delayed. And moreover, the fecundity of BPH was significantly lower when fed on Bt rice than on the non-Bt parental plants.To investigate unintended effects in KMD2 that causes changes in BPH performance, we performed microarray (GeneChip) analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between Bt rice and non-transgenic parental plants in response to BPH infestation. We used microarrays to detect Bt-independent variation, which might render Bt rice more defensive or less nutritious to BPH.

DESIGN
For BPH treatment, 10 second-instar nymphs were infested onto each 30-day-old seedling. After 72 h, the BPH nymphs were carefully removed and rice shoots of both BPH-infested and non-infested plants were sampled for microarray analysis. There were four treatments: Xiushui 11-non infested, Xiushui 11-BPH infested, KMD2-non infested, KMD2-BPH infested, three biological replications.
