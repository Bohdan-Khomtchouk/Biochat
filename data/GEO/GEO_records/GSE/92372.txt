TITLE
Expression profile of P7 control and Lhx2 cKO somatosensory cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of control and Lhx2 cKO somatosensory cortices to determine differentially expressed genes at P7 resulting from the loss of Lhx2 in post-mitotic neurons.

DESIGN
RNA from primary somatosensory cortices (S1) of three control (Lhx2f/f) and three Lhx2 cKO (Lhx2f/f;Nex-Cre) cortices were collected at postnatal day 7 for microarray analysis.
