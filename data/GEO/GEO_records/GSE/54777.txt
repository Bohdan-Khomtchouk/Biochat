TITLE
Transcriptome-wide effects of sexual selection on the fate of new mutations

ORGANISM
Drosophila serrata

SUMMARY
Sexual selection on males is predicted to have widespread effects on genetic variation as a consequence of the pleiotropic allelic effects on sexual and non-sexual traits. We manipulated the opportunity for sexual selection on males during 27 generations of mutation accumulation in inbred lines of Drosophila serrata, and used a microarray platform to investigate the effect of sexual selection on the expression of 2689 genes. While gene expression signal was, on average, higher in the absence of sexual selection, this difference was small (0.1%). In contrast, sexual selection impacted substantially on the mutational variance in gene expression. Over all genes, mutational variance in gene expression was, on average, 42% higher when sexual selection operated than when it was absent. Our results indicate that sexual selection on males can generate widespread effects across the genome. An increase in mutational variance without a corresponding change in mean suggested that most expression traits were unlikely to be under direct sexual selection. Instead, the mutational variance in gene expression traits is consistent with divergence generated by widespread pleiotropic associations with traits affecting male mating success.

DESIGN
We measured gene expression of male Drosophila serrata from 41 mutation accumulation lines (whole-body) that were sexually selected. Data from two replicates for each line are presented.
