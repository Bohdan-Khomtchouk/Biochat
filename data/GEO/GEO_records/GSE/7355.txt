TITLE
Candida-induced expression profile in HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified 56 genes that were transcriptionally up-regulated and 69 that were suppressed upon exposure of endothelial cells to C. albicans. Among the regulated genes those attributed to the categories ‘chemotaxis’, ‘signaling’, and ‘transcription and translation’ were remarkably overrepresented. Keywords: endothelial stress response

DESIGN
We performed 4 independent experiments comparing the expression profiles of untreated HUVEC monolayer with those of candida-infected HUVEC monolayer.
