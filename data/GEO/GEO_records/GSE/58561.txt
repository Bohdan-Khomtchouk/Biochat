TITLE
Gene expression profiles for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines and their corresponding normal and fresh frozen tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To demonstrate that the generated cell lines represent the parental tumours we compared the mRNA expression patterns obtained from the generated cell lines, the original tumours, as well as non-tumorigenic pancreatic tissue from the same patients

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the cell lines PpaX1, PpaX6 and PpaX8 as well as their corresponding original tumours and adjacent normal tissue from patient Ppa6 and Ppa8 and analysed by microarray analysis using the 60K agilent platform. The expression profiles were background corrected and quantile normalized. Filtering of controls, unannotated genes and low expressed probes was done. 10,947 genes were used to demonstarte the relationship between the cell lines and parental tumors.
