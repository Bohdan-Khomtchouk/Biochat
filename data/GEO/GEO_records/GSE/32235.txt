TITLE
Differentially regulated genes induced by in vitro generated Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis cell wall deficient forms

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of chemically generated Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis cell wall deficient forms, comparing untreated control cells (bacillary forms) and cell wall deficient cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MAP-K vs. MAP-Sph cells. Biological replicates: 3 controls, 3 spheroplasts, independently grown and harvested. In controls and spheroplasts, good quality RNA samples obtained from each pellet were pooled together and used for microarray experiments to get an average of three separate experiments, four replicates per array.
