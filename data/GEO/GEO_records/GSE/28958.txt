TITLE
Expression data from monoiodoacetate-induced arthritis in a rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The progression of arthritis involves sequential regulation of catabolic and anabolic genes that degenerate cartilages. We used microarrays to determine temporal regulation of genes during the progression of monoiodoacetate-induced arthritis in the knees of rats.

DESIGN
Experimental arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate (2 mg/ 50 ul) in the knees of rats. Cartilages from distal end of femur were collected on day 5, 9 and 21 post-injection. Saline injection was used as a sham control.
