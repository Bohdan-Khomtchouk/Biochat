TITLE
Identification and characterization of microRNA expression in Ginkgo biloba L. leaves

ORGANISM
Ginkgo biloba

SUMMARY
High-throughput small RNA sequencing were performed to identify a large number of miRNAs and their targets in mature female and male G. biloba leaves for the first time. We ascertained that the regulatory networks of the miRNAs are involved in many different primary biological processes based on potential target designations. Our study is the first to provide useful information for uncovering the regulatory networks of miRNAs in basal gymnosperm G. biloba leaves.
