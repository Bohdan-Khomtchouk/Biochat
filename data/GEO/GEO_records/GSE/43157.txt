TITLE
Expression data from siRNA knockdown of Ehf in primary human corneal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ehf is a transcriptional regulator that is highly expressed and enriched in corneal epithelium. To gain insights into the role of Ehf in the corneal epithelium, we performed siRNA knockdown of Ehf in primary human corneal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Primary human corneal epithelial cells were transfected with siEhf or si controls, plated, and harvested at 72 hr.
