affy_med_2012_03-Characterization of new phytostimulatrices molecules for the improvement of plants products and crop resistance to diseases

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_med_2012_03 - affy_med_2012_03 - Aphanomyces euteiches is a major legume parasite related to S. parasitica. Analysis of its cell wall showed the presence of an unsusual high content in GlcNAc, representing 10% of the total carbohydrates. Interestingly, this compound does not form crystalline chitin, but amorphous chitosaccharides. The aim goal of this study is to compare the response to a preparation of crab shell chitin chitooligosaccharides with a mean DP of 7 and to A.euteiches chitosaccharides at a transcriptomic level. This comparison will be done on Medicago truncatula wild type compared to the nfp-1 and nfp-2 mutants. -  7-day-old A17 wild type or mutant nfp-1 or nfp-2 plants were grown in vitro on liquid M medium. The entire roots were then treated (or not = controls) with a preparation of crab shell chitin chitooligosaccharides of a mean DP of 7 or with chitosaccharides from A. euteiches cell wall, names fraction P2F1, and harvested after 4 hours of incubation. Three independent repeats were performed.
