TITLE
Conventional and pioneer modes of glucocorticoid receptor interaction with enhancer chromatin in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show how chromatin structure is involved in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in a mouse mammary cell line. We show that GR binds to accessible chromatin sites that are either nucleosome-free or contain a nucleosome.

DESIGN
Performed micrococcal nuclease digests of 3134 cells along with high-throughput paired-end sequencing to precisely map nucleosome positions genome wide. Overlay this data with new and existing DNase-Sequencing and ChIP Sequecing data.

PLATFORM
