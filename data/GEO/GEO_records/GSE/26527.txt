TITLE
The TLR2 pathway is required for self-renewal of mammary cancer initiating cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the past few years, mammary cancer initiating cells (CICs) have been identified in mouse and human as a subpopulation of tumor cells that selectively posses tumor initiation and self-renewal capacity and the ability to give rise to bulk populations of non-tumorigenic cancer cells progeny through differentiation. They could also be responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, resistance to therapy and recurrence. Thus, the understanding of the pathways regulating CIC self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenicity represents an important task in the development of effective anticancer therapies. To detect the set of genes associated to CIC in our mouse breast cancer model we analysed three prototypic situations: TUBO cells grown in DMEM under adherent conditions (called TDA in GSE26517 and epithelial bulk in GSE21451), TUBO cells grown in mammosphere medium under adherent conditions (called TMA  in GSE26517), TUBO cells grown in mammosphere medium under low-attachment conditions (called mammospheres p1 in GSE21451), i.e. the conditions used to support the formation of mammospheres. This analysis led to the identification of growth factors and immune system-related genes, including toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The inhibition of TLR2 signaling pathway strongly impaired mammosphere generation, demonstrating the involvement of TLR2 in CSC self-renewal.
