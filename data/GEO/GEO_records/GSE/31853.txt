TITLE
Expression data from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-derived cell lines and normal oral keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a lethal disease and early death usually occurs as a result of local invasion and regional lymph node metastases. We used microarrays to identify down or upregulated genes in OSCCs compared with non-malignant controls.

DESIGN
To identify genes whose transcription is deregulated in OSCC, the gene expression profiles of eight OSCC cell lines (H-series and M9) and three primary cultures of normal oral keratinocytes (NKs) were examined using Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
