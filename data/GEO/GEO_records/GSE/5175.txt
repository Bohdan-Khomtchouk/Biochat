TITLE
A computational genomics approach to identify cis-regulatory modules - a case study using E2F1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We first trained a set of experimentally identified E2F1 targets by a ChIPModules approach, the identified module of E2F1 and AP-2alpha was validated by ChIP-chip assays. Keywords: ChIP-chip
