TITLE
A computational genomics approach to identify cis-regulatory modules - a case study using E2F1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We first trained a set of experimentally identified E2F1 targets by a ChIPModules approach, the identified module of E2F1 and AP-2alpha was validated by ChIP-chip assays. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
We have performed 3 sets of ChIP-chip experiments in MCF-7 for E2F1 and AP-2alpha respectively. The common genes bound by both E2F1 and AP-2alpha were then identified as a co-localized set of genes. We also performed ChIP-PCR conformation for randomly selected 10 targets.
