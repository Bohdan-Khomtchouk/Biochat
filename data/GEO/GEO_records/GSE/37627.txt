SUMMARY
Cardiac fibrosis is a detrimental pathophysiological state involved in a number of cardiovascular diseases. Myofibroblasts mediate fibrosis by excessive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which ultimately leads to tissue stiffness and impaired heart performance. Recently, it was shown that a substantial fraction of cardiac myofibroblasts may originate from the epicardium through Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). We have developed a cellular model of EMT in which adult murine epicardium-derived cells are differentiated into myofibroblast-like cells in the presence of Interleukin-1beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, or Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Using this model of EMT, the microRNAome was assessed by microRNA (miRNA) arrays. Subsequently, expression levels of differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qPCR. These miRNAs were targeted by transfecting epicardium-derived cells with anti- or pre-miRs prior to EMT initiation. The ability of the anti- or pre-miRs to inhibit EMT was assessed on a number of phenotypic markers. In this study we have identified a number of miRNAs that potentially play an intrinsic role in cardiac EMT. We speculate that by targeting those miRNA, the onset and long-term progression of cardiac fibrosis can be substantially reduced.
