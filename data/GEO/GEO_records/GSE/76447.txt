TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of post-mature green seeds from Arabidopsis ddcc mutant and wild-type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The role of on-CG methylation in seed development and dormancy remains unknown. There are four genes in charge of non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis: drm1, drm2, cmt2 and cmt3. The majority of non-CG methylation in vegetative tissues, leaf, is gone in homozygous ddcc mutant line (Hume et al., 2014). To uncover the possible role of non-CG DNA methylation in seed development and dormancy, we characterized the transcriptome of ddcc mutant in Arabidopsis post-mature green seeds using Illumina sequencing. Meanwhile, post-mature green seeds from wild type were used as control.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of transcripts from post-mature green seeds of ddcc mutant and wild type. Two biological replicates were collected.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
