TITLE
Expression data from Em-Myc mouse lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ezh2 encodes for the catalyc unit of the PRC2 complex. RNAi-mediated suppressing of Ezh2 by two independent shRNAs promotes Em-myc lymphomagenesis in vivo. Microarray were used to explore the trascriptional changes driven by suppression of Ezh2 in Em-myc cells and to identify which programs contribute to promotion of lymphoma formation.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from  purified primary  lymphoma cells  for each shRNAs targeting Ezh2 and  from two independent preparations of premalignant Em-myc cells. Mouse Genome 1.0 ST arrays were processed according to the manifacturer`s instructions.
