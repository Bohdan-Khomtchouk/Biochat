Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes; however, few have been identified that regulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the progression of liver fibrosis. Through a detailed analysis of the expression of lncRNAs in various tissues, we discovered the existence of a liver enriched lncRNA-LFAR1 (lncRNA-Liver Fibrosis Associated RNA1). To identify the roles of  lncRNA-LFAR1 in liver fiboris, we systematically analyzed the regulation of mRNAs in the livers of mice treated with oil in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC, n=3), CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC+CCl4, n=3), oil in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1, n=3) and CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1+CCl4, n=3) by mRNA microarrays, which revealed a panel of mRNAs that were specifically regulated by lncRNA-LFAR1 in livers of mice undergoing hepatic fibrosis. To identify the roles of lncRNAs-LFAR1 in regulating liver fiboris and the potential targets of lncRNA-LFAR1 in liver fiboris,we determined the mRNA expression profiles in the livers of Balb/c mice treated with oil in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC, n=3), CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC+CCl4, n=3), oil in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1, n=3) and CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1+CCl4, n=3) by mRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
The mRNA expression profile of twelve liver tissues from mice were treated with oil in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC, n=3), CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-NC (NC+CCl4, n=3), oil in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1, n=3) and CCl4 in combination with injection of Lenti-shLFAR1 (shLFAR1+CCl4, n=3) were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
