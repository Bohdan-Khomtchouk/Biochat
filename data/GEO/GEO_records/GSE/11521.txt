TITLE
Gene Expression Kinetics

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have taken five different time points of a Yeast culture in exponential grow in rich medium, each one elapsed ten minutes from de previous one (from OD600 0.36 to 0.47). Then, for each time point we have measured the transcription rates (TR) and mRNA amounts (RA) for all the genes using the Genomic run-on (GRO) technique .
