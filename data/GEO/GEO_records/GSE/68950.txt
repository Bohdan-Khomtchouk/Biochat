TITLE
caArray_golub-00327: Sanger cell line Affymetrix gene expression project

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray gene expression pattern was studied using 798 different cancer cell lines. The cancer cell lines are obtained from different centers. Annotation information were provided in the supplementary file.
