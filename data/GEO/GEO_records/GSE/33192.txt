TITLE
miRNA expression profile in leprosy skin biopsy specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Skin biopsy specimens of skin lesions were profiled for miRNA expression. In this study, we indentified miRNA species that were differentially expressed in the skin lesions of either the lepromatous or tuberculoid forms of leprosy.  One miRNA species, hsa-mir-21, found in the lepromatous lesions was capable of downregulating the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway.

DESIGN
Scalpel or punch skin biopsy specimens were obtained after informed consent from patients with tuberculoid leprosy and patients with lepromatous leprosy at the time of diagnosis.  Specimens were embedded in OCT medium, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80Â°C until sectioning.
