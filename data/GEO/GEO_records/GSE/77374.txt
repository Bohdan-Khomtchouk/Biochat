TITLE
RNA-seq data from murine eGFP+ relbfl/flnfkb2fl/flCg1-Cre and Cg1-Cre splenic germinal center B cells purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of murine eGFP+ relbfl/flnfkb2fl/flCg1-Cre and Cg1-Cre splenic germinal center B cells identifies genes regulated by the transcription factors RELB and p52 (NF-kB2) in germinal center B cells.

DESIGN
Germinal center B cells from 12-week old relbfl/flnfkb2fl/flCg1-Cre and Cg1-Cre littermate mice immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were isolated at day 7 after immunization by flow cytometric sorting from splenic mononuclear cells. RNA was isolated, amplified and submitted for RNA-sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument for 35-40 million 2x50 paired-ended reads.
