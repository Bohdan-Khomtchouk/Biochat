TITLE
C.elegans time course study on dietary restriction and aging

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Dietary restriction (DR) is the most powerful natural means to extend lifespan. Here we obtain temporally resolved transcriptomes during calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in Caenorhabditis elegans, and find that early and late responses involve metabolism and cell cycle/DNA damage, respectively.

DESIGN
15 samples of N2 worms were collected every two days from adult day (AD) 2 under three dietary regimens: ad libitum (AL), calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) in this time course Affymetrix microarray experiment. AL, CR and IF treatments were carried out following published protocols (Honjoh et al., 2009, Nature) except the concentration of AL was set to 1x10^10 bacteria/ml while that of CR was set to 1x10^8 bacteria/ml.
