SUMMARY
Purpose: There is evidence that therapeutic cancer vaccines can lengthen survival for some cancer patients, but responses vary widely from one person to another.  Methods to predict clinical outcomes will advance the field and provide new insights into critical determinants of in vivo efficacy.  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to assess correlations between a subject's overall survival after receiving PROSTVAC-VF and his baseline serum anti-glycan antibody levels. Results:  Pre-vaccination antibody levels to blood group A trisaccharide (BG-Atri) were found to have a statistically significant correlation with survival.  Long-term survival was approximately doubled in subjects with abundant anti-BG-Atri IgM relative to subjects with little or no pre-existing IgM for BG-Atri.  This survival correlation was specific to vaccine treatment, as no correlation was observed in control patients immunized with wild-type poxviruses lacking the key tumor antigen, prostate specific antigen (PSA).  Moreover, anti-BG-Atri IgM levels were not correlated with general measures of disease severity, such as PSA levels, Gleason score, or Halabi predicted survival. Conclusion: In addition to reporting a new potentially predictive biomarker for PROSTVAC-VF, this study highlights the potential of glycan microarray technology for personalized medicine.
