TITLE
Microarray analysis on spleens and livers of mice inoculated subcutaneously with J558 myeloma cells and supplemented with oil palm phenolics (OPP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OPP (1500 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) was supplemented to BALB/c mice inoculated subcutaneously with J558 myeloma cells at the dorsum of the neck in order to observe possible immune responses in cancer suppression. Spleens and livers were harvested at three designated time points, eighteen hours, one week and four weeks after inoculation of the cells for gene expression studies. Results show that the expression of immune-related genes in the spleen was delayed, while those related to inflammation in the liver were down-regulated across time, thus suggesting that OPP may have anti-inflammatory properties in suppressing cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from spleens and livers of BALB/c mice given OPP (four weeks after subcutaneous inoculation of J558 myeloma cells) were compared to controls given distilled water at three time points, eighteen hours, one week and four weeks after inoculation of the cells (three replicates per group per time point)
