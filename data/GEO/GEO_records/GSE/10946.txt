Gene expression microarray profiles of cumulus cells in lean and overweight-obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients

SUMMARY
Objective: The etiology of PCOS is mostly unknown. Existing data support both genetic and environmental factors in its pathogenesis.  Design: Prospective case - control study. Setting: University Hospital. Patients:  25 patients undergoing IVF-ICSI treatment.  Intervention: Genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray technology was used to study differential gene-expression patterns of cultured human cumulus cells from IVF patients divided into 4 groups according to disease state (PCOS vs. Control) and BMI (Obese vs. Lean).  Results: Two differential PCOS gene expression profiles were established: Lean-Type was formed by comparing PCOS lean (PL) vs. non-PCOS lean (NL) individuals; Obese-Type was formed by comparing PCOS obese (PO) vs. non-PCOS (NO) obese patients.   Conclusions:  Different molecular pathways are associated with PCOS in Lean and Obese individuals, as demonstrated by gene expression profiling of cumulus cells. Our findings provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of PCOS. We used microarrays to study the gene expression of human cultured cumulus cells. We  compared the genes expression of lean PCOS,  Obese PCOS, lean controls and obese controls. Different molecular pathways are associated with PCOS in Lean and Obese patients.
