TITLE
A mouse model of HIES reveals pro and anti-inflammatory functions of STAT3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations of STAT3 underlie the autosomal dominant form of hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES). STAT3 has critical roles in immune cells and thus, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), might be a reasonable therapeutic strategy in this disease.  However, STAT3 also has critical functions in non-hematopoietic cells and dissecting the protean roles of STAT3 is limited by the lethality associated with germline deletion of Stat3.  Thus, predicting the efficacy of HSCT for HIES is difficult. To begin to dissect the importance of STAT3 in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells as it relates to HIES, we generated a mouse model of this disease.  We found that these transgenic mice recapitulate multiple aspects of HIES, including elevated serum IgE and failure to generate Th17 cells.  We found that these mice were susceptible to bacterial infection that was partially corrected by HSCT using wild type bone marrow, emphasizing the role played by the epithelium in the pathophysiology of HIES.

DESIGN
The effect of IL-6 and IL-10 on BM-DC gene expression was investigated in cell derived from wild type or mut-Stat3 mice
