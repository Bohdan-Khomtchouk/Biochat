TITLE
Notch/HES1-mediated PARP1 activation: A cell-type specific mechanism for tumor suppression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Notch signaling plays both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles, depending on cell type. In contrast to T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where Notch activation promotes leukemogenesis, induction of Notch signaling in B-ALL leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. The Notch target Hairy/Enhancer of Split1 (HES1) is sufficient to reproduce this tumor suppressor phenotype in B-ALL, however the mechanism is not yet known. Here we report that HES1 regulates pro-apoptotic signals via the novel interacting protein Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase1 (PARP1) in a cell type-specific manner. The interaction of HES1 with PARP1 inhibits HES1 function, induces PARP1 activation and results in PARP1 cleavage in B-ALL. HES1-induced PARP1 activation leads to self-ADP ribosylation of PARP1, consumption of NAD+, diminished ATP levels, and translocation of the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in apoptosis in B-ALL, but not T-ALL. Importantly, induction of Notch signaling via the Notch agonist peptide DSL can reproduce these events and leads to BALL apoptosis. The novel interaction of HES1 and PARP1 in B-ALL modulates the function of the HES1 transcriptional complex and signals through PARP1 to induce apoptosis. This mechanism reveals a cell type-specific pro-apoptotic pathway which may lead to Notch agonist-based cancer therapeutics.

DESIGN
Study involved the gene expression profiling of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, and comparison of the levels of expression NOTCH1 pathway genes and targets across ALL subtypes
