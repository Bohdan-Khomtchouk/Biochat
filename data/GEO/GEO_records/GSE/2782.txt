TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of Lactobacillus acidophilus stress response

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus acidophilus

SUMMARY
We used a whole genome array containing 97.4 % of the annotated genes of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, a probiotic culture that belongs to the lactic acid bacteria group, to identify genes that are differentially expressed under several stress conditions. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
We used a Reference Sample design, where each sample was compared using a dye swap to a common reference sample (early log-phase L. acidophilus cultures resuspended in fresh MRS [pH ~6.8]).
