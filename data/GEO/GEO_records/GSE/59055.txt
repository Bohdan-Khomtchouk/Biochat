TITLE
A newly identified spliced isoform of metadherin differently regulates the global transcriptomic profile in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The current study analyzed the metadherin (MTDH)-mediated altered gene expression profiles in ER positive MCF-7 cells. Some of these altered gene expressions were further inter connected to various pathways which may eventually be recognized as drug targets or biomarkers in those breast cancers where MTDH plays a role in cancer progression/metastasis.

DESIGN
To understand the global differential gene expression profile in MTDH-wild type and a newly identified MTDH-isoform knock down in malignant breast cancer cells. This data was compared to untreated breast cancer cells.
