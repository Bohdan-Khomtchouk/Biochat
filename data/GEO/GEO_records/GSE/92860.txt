TITLE
Gene expression of Th17 cells from arthritic K/BxN mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Th17 cells are involved in the development of many autoimmune diseases. However, recent studies have shown that in addition to the pathological Th17 effector cells located in inflammatory sites, there are also non-pathological Th17 cell types. We examined the expression of previously reported Th17 pathogenic (red font) and non-pathogenic (blue font) genes in Th17 cells isolated from a variety tissues by microarray.

DESIGN
Th17 cells marked by the expression of IL-17-eGFP were isolated from spleen, lung, and SI-LP of IL-17eGFP.K/BxN mice. We compared the fold differences of gene expression in SI-LP Th17 cells over those from spleen or lung for genes associated with pathogenic (red) and non-pathogenic (blue) Th17 cell signatures reported previously (35-37).
