TITLE
Genomic imbalances in BCL1/JH t(11;14)(q13;q32) positive multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to determine copy number variations in the multiple myeloma patients, which were positive for BCL1/JH t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation. Identification of common chromosomal aberrations representing the t(11;14)(q13;q32) subtype is possible by comparing the microarray data across all the samples under studied.

DESIGN
Eight multiple myeloma samples were analyzed. Each sample was compared against normal control (match with patient's race and gender), which was pooled from ten healthy individuals.
