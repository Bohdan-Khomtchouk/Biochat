TITLE
Expression data from murine Treg subsets defined by CD103 and ICOS expression before and after activation by an in vitro CD4 T cell suppression assay

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Treg) are pivotal for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by controlling self-reactive, chronic and homeostatic T cell responses. We now report that the increase in Treg suppressive function observed in lymphopenic mice correlates with the degree of lymphopenia and is caused by a higher frequency of a novel subpopulation of CD103posICOSpos cells among peripheral Treg that differentially express multiple Treg signature genes.

DESIGN
Treg subsets were sorted from wild type mice based on their expression of CD103 and ICOS. Gene expression profile was analysed directly after sorting and after activation of the subsets in a standard CD4 T cell suppression assay.  Two independent experiments were performed.
