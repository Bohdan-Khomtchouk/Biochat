TITLE
3' RNA-Seq (3'SEQ) analysis gene expression profiling at G1-S transition in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hESC-derived endoderm cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this report, we examine transcripts on a genome-wide level between the synchronized cell cycles of hESCs and hESC-derived endoderm cells. We found 10347, 10299 and 10362 genes expressed in the G1, G1/S, and S phase of hESCs, respectively; 10333, 10227 and 10215 genes expressed at the G1, G1/S and S phase of derived endoderm. We compared the transcriptome between these data sets and identified genes with differentiated phase expression between hESCs and hESC-derived endoderm cells.

DESIGN
Examination of the transcriptome at the G1-S transition in hESCs compared to hESC-derived endoderm cells.
