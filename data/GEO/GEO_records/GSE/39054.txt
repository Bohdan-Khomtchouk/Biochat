TITLE
Dual targeting of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer in a genetically engineered mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analyses of differential gene expression analyses from intact versus castrated Nkx3.1CE2/+ or Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f mice

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated form phenotypically wild-type (intact) Nkx3.1CE2/+ (n = 3), intact Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f (n = 6), and castrated Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f (n = 6) prostate. Please contact Cory Abate-Shen (cabateshen@columbia.edu) for questions about the submission.
