TITLE
Paternally-induced transgenerational environmental reprogramming of metabolic gene expression in mammals (meDIP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic information can be inherited through the mammalian germline, and represents a plausible transgenerational carrier of environmental information. To test whether transgenerational inheritance of environmental information occurs in mammals, we carried out an expression profiling screen for genes in mice that responded to paternal diet. As part of this analysis, we chracterise the changes in sperm cytosine methylation in response to different diets. Characterizing the RNA exression changes in livers of offspring mice in response to the paternal diet, comparing between low-protein diet and control-diet.

DESIGN
Examination the effect of 3 different paternal diets, control diet, Caloric Restriction and low-protein diet, on sperm cytosine methylation.
