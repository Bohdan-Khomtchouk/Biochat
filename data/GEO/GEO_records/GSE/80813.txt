TITLE
A genetic basis for cerebral palsy: evidence from copy number variation in patients with hemiplegia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Affymetrix CytoScan HD array is a high resolution SNP platform for studying copy number variations in the human genome.  It is widely being used in both clinical and research settings for identifying causative variants as well as interrogating the genome for benign variants. We employed this platform to investigate the risk factor CNVs in trios diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. We genotyped 101 unrelated probands and their both parents and compared their genotypes to those of 9,611 population controls, in order to identify rare CNVs ( < 0.1% frequency) of at least 10 kb in size that might contribute to CP. We uncovered de novo CNVs and Decipher Syndromes in probands. We have identified additional potentially risk factor CNVs impacting the coding sequencing of genes involved in brain functions.

DESIGN
We employed Affymetrix Chromsome Analysis Suite (ChAS), iPattern, Nexus, and Partek algorithms to call CNVs from the CytoScan HD array data. We defined a stringent set of variants when each variant was called by at least by two algorithms. We defined the ancestry and relatedness of the samples using PLINK.
