TITLE
Furin deficiency efect on T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-cells lacking the proprotein convertase furin. Proprotein convertases promote the proteolytic maturation of proproteins. Furin is induced in activated T-cells. Results provide insight into the function of furin in T-cells.

DESIGN
CD4+CD62L+CD44- naive, CD4+CD62L-CD44+ memory and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells were isolated from Fur flox/flox and CD4 cre Fur flox/flox mice. Naive T cells were activated via TCR. Total RNA was extracted from all cells and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
