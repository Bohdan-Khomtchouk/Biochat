TITLE
Orphan nuclear receptor TR4 uses non-equivalent binding sites to regulate gene targets from proximal and distal transcriptional regulatory elements during human definitive erythropoiesis [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We knocked down TR4 expression by 2 lentiviral mediated vectors at day 11 of erythroid differentiation in order to identify TR4 downstream targets.

DESIGN
Two lentiviruses and one empty control were used to knockdown TR4 expression. The cells were harvested at day 11 during erythroid differentiation.
