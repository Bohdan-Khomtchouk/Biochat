TITLE
p38alfa and ATF2 act differentially depending on DUSP1 expression in NCSCL in response to cisplatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DUSP1 is involved in different cellular pathways including cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and resistance to chemotherapy. To gain insight into the cellular signaling pathways involving DUSP1 actions and the response to Cisplatin (CDDP) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we have used a double strategy that combines microarray and SiRNA technology. This strategy provided a differential expression profile of genes involved in CDDP response in NSCLC cell line regulated by DUSP1 using H460 and H460cri and a time course to CDDP. KEYWORDS: Expression profiling by array in cells with genetic modification in response to CCDP treatment

DESIGN
The human non small lung cancer cell line H460 used in this study was from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The cell line was maintained in RPMI (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine serum and transfected by Lipofectamine Plus Reagent from Life Technologies as directed by the manufacturer. The DUSP1 pSuperRetro-derived vectors were constructed as described (Chattoppadhyay et al., 2006). Clones expressing siRNA for DUSP1 were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of puromycin  and kept for selection. Stable transfection was confirmed by Western blotting. We analyzed the differences in expression of 47000 genes in H460 cells expressing DUSP1SiRNA (H460cri) compared with the parental cell line H460pSuperRetro vector (H460v) after 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours of CDDP exposure, in order to know the different pathways that were activated by CDDP treatment dependent on expression of DUSP1. RNA was extracted and quality control was checked before hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
