TITLE
Quantitation of microRNAs in seminal fluid from men with and without prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine whether prostate cancer-associated miRNAs are present in seminal fluid and, if so, evaluate their diagnostic potential.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing was used to profile and compare miRNAs in the non-sperm cellular fraction of seminal fluid from men with biopsy-proven cancer (one pooled sample from 6 men) and men with elevated serum PSA but negative biopsy results (one pooled sample from 6 men).
