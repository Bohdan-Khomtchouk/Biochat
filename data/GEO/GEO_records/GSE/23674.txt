TITLE
Expression data from human colon cancer cell line HCT116 with NFX1-91 knockdown and control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NFX1-91, a novel E6 cellular downstream target, functions as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in repressing hTERT expression.  Other functions and downstream targets regulated by NFX1-91 were not well understood. We used microarrays to determine gene expression deregulated when NFX1-91 was knocked down.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells was infected with lentivirus carrying NFX1-91 shRNA or control Î²-Galactosidase shRNA to stably knock down target gene expression. Total RNAs were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
