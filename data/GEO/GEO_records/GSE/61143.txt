TITLE
C. albicans biofilm development

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. albicans in biofilms after 90 min of adherence or 8 h, 24 h, or 48 h of development; compared to C. albicans in suspension cultures grown to log at 30 deg or 37 deg or grown to stationary phase at 30 deg or collected from the unadhered cells in the biofilm assay.

DESIGN
At least 2 biological replicates for each condition. All experiments are multiple condition: C. albicans in particular growth condition vs. mixed reference of all conditions in that experiment.

PLATFORM
