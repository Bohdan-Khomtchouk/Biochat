TITLE
Genome-wide copy number profiling of 18 gastric cancer cell lines using 500K SNP arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genomic loci with copy number alterations are known to harbor cancer genes. We investigated a comprehensive panel of gastric cancer cell lines for their genome-wide copy number alterations. Eighteen gastric cancer cell lines were profiled using Affymetrix 500K SNP arrays. For copy number calculation, seven independent normal blood samples were profiled together. The copy numbers were calculated genome-wide, in these cell lines with high resolution and reveal the cell line specific amplification and copy number changes.

DESIGN
18 gastric cancer cell lines were profiled using high resolution 500k SNP arrays from Affymetrix. 7 Independent normal blood samples were profiled and used for copy number calculation.
