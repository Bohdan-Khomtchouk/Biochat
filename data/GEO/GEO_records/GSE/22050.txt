TITLE
Gene expression profiling of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to genetically characterize adenocarcinomas in the gastroesophagel junction in relation to cancers in the esophagus and the stomach. In total 27 tumors was genetically profiled using gene expression array. Adenocarcinomas located in the gastroesophageal junction showed strong similarites with tumors in the distal esophagus, whereas different profiles were generated for tumors in the proximal stomach.

DESIGN
Three types of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas; 10 distal esophageal (EA) tumors, 9 junctional (JA) and 8 proximal stomach cancers (GA) was undergone differentially analysis based on gene expression profiles. One replicate of tumor ID 27_JA (replicate ID 27_JA_2) and one replicate of tumor ID 3-GA (replicate ID 3-GA-2). Reference samples consist of the Stratagene Universal Reference (10 cellines), commercially obtained from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA.
