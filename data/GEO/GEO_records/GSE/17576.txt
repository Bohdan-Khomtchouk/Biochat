SUMMARY
An 8-week high fat palm oil diet causes obesity and insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice, but induces only small changes in the muscle transcriptome. Introduction: The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Two major characteristics of the MS are obesity and insulin resistance. In the present study we investigated the effect of obesity and insulin resistance on the mouse muscle transcriptome. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed a palm oil-based low fat diet (LFD) or high fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks. Microarray analysis was performed by using two complementary strategies: (1) 8-week HFD transcriptome versus 8-week LFD transcriptome and (2) transcriptome of mice sacrificed at the start of the intervention versus 8-week LFD transcriptome and 8-week HFD transcriptome, respectively. Results: HFD mice develop obesity and whole-body insulin resistance. Despite these metabolic disturbances we found that HFD induces relatively small changes in gene expression ( < 1.3 fold). Only the up-regulation of FA oxidation and the down-regulation of the MAPK cascade were specific for the HFD intervention. Eight-weeks of aging induced more changed gene expression levels than the HFD, including genes involved in cell-cell interaction and development. Conclusion: Eight weeks of aging induce more pronounced changes in the muscle transcriptome than an HFD.  Since only one strategy revealed the transcriptional down-regulation of the MAPK cascade, whereas both strategies showed the up-regulation of FA oxidation we suggest the use of complementary analysis strategies by the genome-wide search of gene expression changes induced by mild interventions, such as an HFD.
