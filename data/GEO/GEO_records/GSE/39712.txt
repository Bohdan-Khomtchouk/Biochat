TITLE
RpoHI and RpoHII regulons in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 from gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed expression profiling experiments to determine the respective regulons of RpoHI and RpoHII in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We grew R. sphaeroides in aerobic conditions and induced either proteins ectopically and compared the global gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
The expression profiles of R. sphaeroides strains lacking either RpoHI or RpoHII were compered to strains expressing RpoHI or RpoHII ectopically from a plasmid to detect gene differentially expressed. Three biological replicates were performed for each strain.
