TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing indentifies novel BMP5 downstrem genes and network in HT-29 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although BMP5 belongs to BMPs(TGF-Î²)/Smad signaling pathway, the downstream network induced by BMP5 is far from clear. Our transcriptome sequencing results discovered a novel pathway BMP5 transduces through, the Jak-STAT signaling.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HT-29 (control) and BMP5-expressing HT-29 cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Ion  Proton.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
