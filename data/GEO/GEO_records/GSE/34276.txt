TITLE
Global analysis of TGF-beta-regulated gene expression in MCF10Ca1h (M3) breast tumor xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-betas have complex roles in tumorigenesis,  with context-dependent effects that can either suppress or promote tumor progression. We have previously shown that TGF-beta has tumor suppressor activity in the MCF10Ca1h (M3) human breast cancer xenograft model.  To identify potential molecular players in the tumor suppressor responses,  we performed global gene expression analyses. To determine which genes were regulated by TGF-beta in this tumor model in vivo,  we performed gene expression arrays on tumors derived from xenografts of M3 cells with and without expression of a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor to block activity of endogenous TGF-beta.

DESIGN
Tumor xenografts of MCF10Ca1h (M3) cells that had been transduced ex vivo with pLPCX retrovirus with no insert (CON),  or pLPCX expressing dominant negative type II TGF-beta receptor (dnTbRII) were harvested for gene expression analysis. Six biological replicates of each tumor type were used for a total of 12 samples
