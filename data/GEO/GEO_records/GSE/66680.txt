TITLE
Expression data from the complex I mutant gas-1 (fc21)  C. elegans worms in comparison to wildtype N2 Bristol worm and under the inluence of antioxidant drug treatment

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We studied genome-wide expression profiles of C. elegans young adult worms, complex I mutant gas-1(fc21) compare to the wild type N2 Bristol worm and the effect of different antioxidant drug treatment on the gene expression profile in gas-1(fc21).

DESIGN
4 biological replicates of wildtype (N2 Bristol) synchronized worms grown on OP50 bacteria, 4 biological replicates of the complex I  mutant C. elegans synchronized young adults and 4 biological replicates of synchronized complex I mutant worm treated with the different antioxidant drugs  were used as sources of total RNA, each for hybridization to a single Affymetrix whole-genome microarray.  Comparison of the data was intended to reveal causes of different antioxidant drug treatment on gene expresssion profile  in the complex I mutant gas-1(fc21) worms.  These array data are part of a bigger project of antioxidant drug effects that also includes RNAseq data deposited in SRA as Bioproject PRJNA2751152. Wild-type vs complex I mutant vs complex I mutant treated with antioxidant drug comparison as a method for studying the possible beneficial effect of these drugs.
