TITLE
Caspase-10 is a negative regulator of caspase-8-mediated cell death with gene inductive properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) initiates the extrinsic apoptotic signalling cascade. Caspase-8 and its regulator cFLIP control death signalling by binding to the receptor via DISC-bound FADD. By elucidating the function of Caspase-10, a close homologue of caspase-8, we unexpectedly found that caspase-10 negatively regulates caspase-8-mediated cell death signalling in the DISC. We demonstrate that caspase-10 inhibits the activation of caspase-8 independent of cFLIP. Furthermore, we show that caspase-8 does not compete with other tandem DED proteins such as cFLIP or caspase-10 in binding via FADD to the receptor as current models suggest. By utilizing caspase-8 knockout cells, we demonstrate that caspase-8 has to be placed upstream of both cFLIP and caspase-10 in the DISC. We further show that DISC formation and/or stability depends on caspase-8 but is independent from its enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, we identified caspase-10 to rewire DISC-signalling to NF-kB activation and cell survival. Our data are consistent with a model in which caspase-10 and cFLIP co-ordinately regulate caspase-8-mediated cell death signalling.

DESIGN
Caspase-10 and control shRNA expressing HeLa cells were analysed for gene expression in respect to CD95L stimulation by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three indepedent replicates were used for each condition. Untreated cells served as a reference of basal gene expression.
