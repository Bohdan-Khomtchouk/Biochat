TITLE
Gene expression changes occuring as a result of KLF6 knockdown in murine HCC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed whole genome expression profiling using a murine HCC cell line that was either infected with a virus containing shRNA targeting KLF6 or GFP. 3 sets of infections were performed for both shGFP and shKLF6 samples. RNA was isolated from these samples and subsequently analyzed.

DESIGN
Determination of gene expression changes in a murine HCC cell line was performed with 3 sets of infections performed for both shGFP and shKLF6. RNA was isolated from these samples and subsequently analyzed using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 chip.
