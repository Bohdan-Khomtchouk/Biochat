TITLE
RNA sequencing of hPSC-derived cardiac progenitors and endocardium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized a dual reporting hPSC line that identified cells expressing NKX2.5 and endothelal cells to characterize discrete milestones during cardiac and vascular differentiaiton. Comparing populations that express either or both reporters to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we document a unique molecular phenotype in hPSC-derived endocardium that points toward an important role for Wnt signaling during vascular specification of cardiac progenitors.

DESIGN
Sequencing mRNA from biological triplicate samples of: 1) hPSC derivatives expressing NKX2.5 alone; 2) hPSC derivatives expressing NKX2.5 and endothelial markers; and 3) hPSC derivatives expressing only endothelial markers.
