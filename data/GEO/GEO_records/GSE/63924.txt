TITLE
Gene expression changes in Paxillus involutus- Betula pendula ectomycorrhizal roots compared to  Paxillus involutus mycelium patches

ORGANISM
Paxillus involutus

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from  Paxillus involutus ectomycorrhizal roots compared to mycelium patches . Mycorrhizal roots  were harvested after 4 weeks, pooled and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Paxillus involutus ( ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Paxillus involutus ectomycorrhizal roots and mycelium patches were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Two biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
