TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of C/EBP delta in mouse bone-marrow macrophages stimulated with LPS for 6hr

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The innate immune system is a two-edged sword; it is absolutely required for host defense against infection, but if left uncontrolled can trigger a plethora of inflammatory diseases.  Here we used systems biology approaches to predict and validate a gene regulatory network involving a dynamic interplay between the transcription factors NF-kB, C/EBPd, and ATF3 that controls inflammatory responses.  We mathematically modeled transcriptional regulation of Il6 and Cebpd genes and experimentally validated the prediction that the combination of an initiator (NF-kB), an amplifier (C/EBPd) and an attenuator (ATF3) forms a regulatory circuit that discriminates between transient and persistent Toll-like receptor 4-induced signals. Our results suggest a mechanism that enables the innate immune system to detect the duration of infection and to respond appropriately. Keywords: ChIP-chip
