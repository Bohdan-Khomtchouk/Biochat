TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of regulatory effects of quercetin and resveratrol supplementation in high fat diet fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To systemically evaluate the comprehensive alterations under the supplements of quercetin and/or resveratrol in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes that differentially altered by different treatments. Gene expression profiles were significantly altered by long term HFD feeding. However, quercetin, resveratrol and their combination could effectively attenuate this alteration. Especially, combination use of quercetin and resveratrol showed more signifcant benefits on the changes of genes, involved in metabolic disorders, induced by HFD, which revealed a synergistic effect of quercetin and resveratrol supplementation in high fat diet fed mice.

DESIGN
Thirty 7-week-old male C57/6J mice were  mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n= 6): control group fed with standard diet (SD); HFD group; quercetin (HQ) group fed with HFD and 0.4% quercetin (4 g/kg diet); resveratrol (HR) group fed with HFD and 0.4% resveratrol (4g/kg diet); quercertin+resveratrol (HQR) group fed with HFD and 0.2% quercetin + 0.2% resveratrol (2g quercetin+ 2g resveratrol per kg diet). All mice were kept on corresponding diets for 26 weeks. Finally, total RNA of liver tissue of each mouse was extracted and hybridized to the microarry. Two RNA samples were exculded for microarry experiment due to the obvious degradation.
