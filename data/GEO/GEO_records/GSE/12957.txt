TITLE
Sustained R848 treatment of Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PCR Array Profiling - R848 does not induce TLR-signaling related genes in TLR7-/- mice. Aim: To corroborate TLR7-dependency of R848 in mice " Triggering TLR7 in mice induces immune activation and lymphoid system disruption, resembling HIV-mediated pathology " , Baenziger et al. Blood 2008

DESIGN
Mice (n=3/sample) were treated with 1mg/kg/d R848 or PBS (Mock) for 7 days. Thereafter, spleen was removed, mRNA extracted from whole splenic tissue and subsequently subjected to microarray RT² Profiler PCR array (Bioscience Corporation) on a Biorad iCycler. The PCR Array system examines the expression of 84 genes related to TLR-mediated signal transduction. Raw Data (i.e., Ct values) are shown. Ct values > 35 or blank was set to 35. The supplementary file show data generated by real-time quantitative PCR normalized to Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1, Heat shock protein 90kDa alpha, and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, displayed as fold difference in the expression of each gene between R848- and Mock-treated samples. Two independent experiments are summarized for wild-type mice. TLR7- and IFNAR-/- animals were tested once.
