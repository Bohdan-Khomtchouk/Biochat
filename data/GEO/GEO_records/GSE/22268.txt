TITLE
ChIP-Seq of H3K79me2 in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K79 dimethylation is a mark of transcriptional elongation.Â  To gain insight into the set of genes actively transcribed in MEFs, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed to determine the presence of H3K79me2 across the genome.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against H3K79me2.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
