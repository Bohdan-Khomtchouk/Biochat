TITLE
Reproductive aging: sma-2;fem-1 day 8 oocyte vs fem-1 day 8 oocyte

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To find genes downstream of the TGF-beta Sma/Mab pathway in C. elegans oocytes associated with reproductive aging.

DESIGN
Eight replicates comparing RNA from oocyte samples collected from day 8 sma-2(e502);fem-1(hc17) animals with RNA from oocyte samples collected from day 8 fem-1(hc17) animals. Five out of eight are dye-flipped.

PLATFORM
