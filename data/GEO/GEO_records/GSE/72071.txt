TITLE
MIRA-Seq analysis of bovine dermal fibroblasts isolated from two breeds of cattle, Holstein (dairy breed) and Angus (beef breed).

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We report the results of MIRA-Seq based high-throughput profiling of the bovine dermal fibroblast methylome from two different breeds of cattle (n=4/breed) to determine the breed-dependent differences in methylation.

DESIGN
Fibroblasts were isolated from 4 animals of each cattle breed (Angus and Holstein). Cells were not treated.
