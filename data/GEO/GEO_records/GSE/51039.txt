TITLE
Expression data from 8-10 week old WT mice maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (FiO2 > 95%) for 48 hrs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To detect sex-specific differences in gene expression in a model of hyperoxic lung injury in adult C56BL/6J mice. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from lungs from 8-10 week old male and female WT C57BL/6J mice exposed to hyperoxia for 48 hours amd room air controls.These data were used to determine differences in transcriptome between male and female mice after hyperoxia exposure

DESIGN
12 total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons: 5 comparisons (M/F: male/female, A/O: air/oxygen): 1) M_O - M_A,  2) F_O - F_A, 3) M_O - F_O, 4) M_A - F_A, 5) (M_O - M_A) - (F_O - F_A). Genes with an FDR≤5% and a fold-change ≥1.4 were selected.
