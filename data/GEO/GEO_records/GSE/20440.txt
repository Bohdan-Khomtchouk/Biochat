TITLE
Characterization of the NifA-RpoN Regulon in Rhizobium etli CFN42 in Free Life using whole genome transcript analysis

ORGANISM
Rhizobium etli CFN 42

SUMMARY
DNA microarray technology was used to survey changes in gene expression in R. etli CFN42 wild type compared with NifA CFNX247 mutant strain under microaerobic (free living) conditions. As expected, several genes associated with a NifA binding site were downregulated in the NifA mutant strain.

DESIGN
Three independent biological materials with one dyeswap were performed.
