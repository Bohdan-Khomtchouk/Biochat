TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of dendritic cells activated by VLPs or ncRNAVLPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect on dendritic cells of the injection in C57BL/6 mice of VLPs or ncRNAVLPs  at gene expression level.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from murine splenic dendritic cells sorted 6 hours after injection of VLP, ncRNAVLP or PBS for control.
