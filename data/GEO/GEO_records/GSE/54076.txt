TITLE
Gene expression profiles after injection of zebrafish with NV (non virion) recombinant protein from Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
NV is a viral protein  only present in the genus Novirhabdovirus (fam Rhabdoviridae), its function is not well characterized yet. In this study we try to shed some light in the biological function of this viral protein in the zebrafish. We describe here  transcripts induced after injection of adult zebrafish with NV recombinant protein of VHSV. Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related zebrafish genes were studied in zebrafish internal organs (pooled spleen and head kidney).

DESIGN
6 zebrafish were divided in two groups, 3 per group . First group  was injected with recombinant NV protein (tag:polyhistidine tail) and second group was used as a control and injected with polyhistidine protein.  Two days after injection, zebrafish were sacrified and head kidney and spleen of each individual were extracted and pooled between this group. This experiment was repeated three times to get four biological replicates. RNA was  extracted and submitted to quality controls. Lately, RNA was labelled with Cy3 and used in the Agilent  Danio rerio custom  array zfin 2.2 ID: 47562.

PLATFORM
