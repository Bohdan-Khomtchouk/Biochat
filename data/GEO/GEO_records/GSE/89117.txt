TITLE
Gene expression signature of WT siblings and hif1α mutants in normoxia and after hypoxia chamber incubation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with differential expression in WT and hif1α mutants and consequent different response to normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Two different conditions were considered: 50 hpf mutants and WT in normoxia, 50 hpf mutants and WT after hypoxia chamber treatment (2 hours after 3% O2)

DESIGN
Embryos at 50 hpf
