TITLE
Expression data of IL-18 generated murine NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles of IL-18 generated murine NK cells in comparison to unstimulated, freshly isolated splenic NK cells. We identified a set of 1414 Affymetrix probe sets showing significant misregulation (Welch's T-test, p < 0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrected).

DESIGN
IL-18 generated as well as unstimulated NK cells were isolated in three independent preparations and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
