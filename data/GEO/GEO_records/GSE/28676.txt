TITLE
Molecular characterization of two unrelated patients ABCB4 deletions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To allow acute characterization of ABCB4 locus constitutional deletion in two patients with cholelithiasis/cholestasis, an Agilent 2X400 array CGH was used. Goal was to obtain genomic rearrangements fine characterization in order to describe ABCB4 constitutional deletions.

DESIGN
ABCB4 locus microdeletions characterization vs reference sample (pool of six normal control DNAs)
