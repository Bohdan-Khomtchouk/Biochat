TITLE
Increased antigenicity of NURF-depleted tumors enhances CD8 T cell-mediated antitumor immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Depleting the NURF chromatin remodeling complex results in enhanced antitumor immunity using mouse tumor models syngenic to two strain backgrounds. Selective depletion of immune cells from tumor-bearing mice discovers that both CD8+ and CD4+ cells are necessary for enhanced antitumor immunity to NURF-depleted cells. Our results suggest that NURF-depleted cells have significant differences in antigenicity compared to control cells.

DESIGN
Cloning, functional and molecular assays of CD8 T cells were performed to identify clones with enhanced activity to NURF-depleted tumor cells in NSG mice compared to control tumors.
