TITLE
Dysregulated gene expression in cardiac chambers of adult Mef2a knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we have identified MEF2A-sensitive genes in atrial and ventricular chambers of the adult heart. MEF2A is a member of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. MEF2 proteins are expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues and are conserved across many mammalian species, but the gene programs regulated by MEF2A in adult cardiac chambers are largely unknown. We compared gene expression profiles between WT and Mef2a knockout atria and ventricles from adult mice, and the results identified distinct and overlapping sets of genes sensitive to the loss of MEF2A in the adult heart.

DESIGN
Total RNA from atrial and ventricular cardiac tissue were pooled into four groups: WT atria (N=7), KO atria (N=7), WT ventricles (N=7), and KO ventricles (N=7). Global gene dysregulation was analyzed via microarray by comparing KO to WT atria, and KO to WT ventricles. Additionally, transcript enrichment in cardiac chambers was analyzed by comparing WT atria to ventricles. Mice were at 2 months of age, and both male and female mice were used.
