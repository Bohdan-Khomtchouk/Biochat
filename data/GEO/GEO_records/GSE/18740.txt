TITLE
Luteolin has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects on microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our aim was to identify genes that were differentially expressed in microglia stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide, Luteolin, or both. Affymetrix microarrays were used to analyze RNA samples

DESIGN
RNA from control BV-2 cells, and cells treated for 24h with LPS, Luteolin, or LPS+Luteolin was analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays. Biological triplicates were analyzed for each condition

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
