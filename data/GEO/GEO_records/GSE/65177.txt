TITLE
RNAseq comparison of gene expression profiles in ScxGFP positive cells and ScxGFP negative cells from E13.5 forelimb samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAs were isolated from FACS sorted ScxGFP positive cells and GFP negative cells of forelimbs at E13.5, and characterized by RNAseq

DESIGN
for each sample, 3 pairs of total 6 E13.5 forelimbs were pooled together, both GFP positive cells and GFP negative cells were FACS sorted, then for RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation and proceeded for RNAseq

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
