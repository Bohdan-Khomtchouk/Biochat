TITLE
Intratumor Heterogeneity and Precision of Microarray-Based Predictors of Breast Cancer Biology and Clinical Outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling was performed on 50 core needle biopsies from 18 breast cancer patients using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome Plus 2.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
Global profiles of expression were characterized using unsupervised clustering methods and variance components models. Precision of predictors of breast cancer biology and clinical outcome were evaluated by interclass correlation.
