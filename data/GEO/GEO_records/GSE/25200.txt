TITLE
Cyclosporine on fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the gene profile of anti-fibroproliferative effects of cyclosporine, we added TGF-b and/or CsA to MRC5 (fetal human lung fibroblast) cell line. After 24 hours serum starvation, fibroblasts were treated with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 and were treated with or without 2μg/ml Cyclosporine and effects were examined at 48 hours after treatment.  Expression of three genes (IGFBP3, ID1 and PPARG) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
TGF-β and cyclosporine induced gene expression data was measured in MRC5 (fetal human fibroblast cell line) at 48h after treatments. The dose of TGF-β was 3 ng/ml and cyclosporine was 2 μg/ml. The comparison was done between four groups (control, TGF-β, cyclosporine and TGF-β plus cyclosporine).Three independent experiments were performed at each treatments using different samples for each experiment.
