TITLE
transferred T helper cell sorted from mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were injected s.c. in the front of the abdomen with 1 × 106  B16-OVA tumor cells. At 10 days after tumor injection, mice (5/group) were treated with adoptive transfer of 2.5 × 106 Th1, Th9 or Th17 cells, followed by i.v. injection of 2.5 × 105 peptide-pulsed BMDC. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) from CD45.1+CD4+ Th cells sorted from spleens of tumor-bearing mice 12 days after transfer.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) from CD45.1+CD4+ Th cells sorted from spleens of tumor-bearing mice 12 days after transfer.
