TITLE
Gene expression profile of CD8+ T cell subtypes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OT-I na√Øve T cells, central memory T cells, effector memory T cells and skin infiltrating T cells were sorted out from mice at different timepoints post infection OT-I cells from 15-20 mice were pooled together for each microarray dataset

DESIGN
By comparing the gene expression profile among different T cell subtypes, we aimed to identify core regulatory genes in skin CD8+ tissue resident memory T cell differentiation and maintenance in epithelia tissue
