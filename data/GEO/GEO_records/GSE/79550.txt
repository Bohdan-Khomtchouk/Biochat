TITLE
mRNA sequence data from anterior ovarioles of w1118 virgin females of Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of anterior ovarioles (germaria and round previtellogenic egg chambers) of w1118 virgin females of Drosophila melanogaster 1 to 8 days post eclosion.

DESIGN
Anterior ovarioles were dissected from w1118 virgin females 1 to 8 days post eclosion. Three independent biological replicates were prepared for each day. Total RNA was isolated from the samples and used for the generation of multiplexed stranded PolyA+ libraries. External RNA controls were added to ovarian polyA+ RNA during library preparation. 76bp single end libraries were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
