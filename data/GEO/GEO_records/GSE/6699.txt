TITLE
Perirenal and epididymal preadipocytes from young and old rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Inherent depot- and age-dependent preadipocyte characteristics may contribute to age-related fat redistribution. Both aging and depot origin affect preadipocyte replication and adipogenesis. To define responsible mechanisms, we analyzed genome-wide expression profiles in epididymal (E) and perirenal (P) preadipocytes cultured from young (3 month) and old (30m) rats. Differences between depots were distinct from and more dramatic than those that occur with aging. Keywords: cell type and age comparison
