TITLE
Long-term Salt & Water Stress in Grapes

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Potted Cabernet Sauvignon vines in the greenhouse were exposed to irrigated controls, non-irrigated water-deficits, and saline treatments for 16 days. Plant shoot tips were harvested every 4 days (0,4,8,12, and 16 days) to measure the progression of changes of global gene expression due to the stress. PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Grant Cramer.  The equivalent experiment is VV2 at PLEXdb.
