TITLE
MCF10A H-Ras RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired-end sequencing of Vector and H-Ras expressing cell lines: p53-del and WT-p53 We found that activated forms of H-Ras and PIK3CA oncogene lead to repression of p63, a p53 family member. They also lead to induction of EMT, a cancer-related process. Our results suggest that, through Ras regulation of p63, this oncogene can drive mammary epithelial cells towards greater invasive ability.

DESIGN
4 samples analyzed with 3 replicates each, control samples for each H-Ras line are the Vector cell line created at the same time
