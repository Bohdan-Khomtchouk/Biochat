TITLE
Identification of cell cycle-regulated genes periodically expressed in U2OS cells and their regulation by FOXM1 and E2F transcription factors [Expression array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified the cell cycle-regulated mRNA transcripts genome-wide in the osteosarcoma derived U2OS cell line.  This resulted in 2,140 transcripts mapping to 1,871 unique cell cycle-regulated genes that show periodic oscillations across multiple synchronous cell cycles.  We identified genomic loci bound by the G2/M transcription factor FOXM1 by Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and associated these with cell cycle-regulated genes.  FOXM1 was bound to cell cycle-regulated genes with peak expression in both S phase and G2/M phases.  ChIP-seq genomic loci were shown to be responsive to FOXM1 using a real-time luciferase assay in live cells, showing that FOXM1 strongly activates promoters of G2/M phase genes and weakly activates those induced in S phase.  Analysis of ChIP-seq data from a panel of cell cycle-transcription factors (E2F1, E2F4, E2F6, and GABPA) from ENCODE and ChIP-seq data for the DREAM complex, found that a set of core cell cycle genes regulated in both U2OS and HeLa cells are bound by multiple cell cycle transcription factors.  These data identify the cell cycle regulated genes in a second cancer derived cell line and provide a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional regulatory systems controlling periodic gene expression in the human cell division cycle.

DESIGN
Cell cycle-regulated gene expression identified from three double thymidine time courses and one thymidine nocodazole time course.
