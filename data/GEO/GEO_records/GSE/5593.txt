TITLE
Acetaminophen (APAP) Rat Blood Training Gene Expression Data Set

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression training data set from rat blood samples exposed to either 150, 1500 or 2500 mg/kg of APAP for 6, 12 or 24 hours. Keywords: Dose response, Time course, Microarray, Gene expression

DESIGN
Male F344/N rats, 10-12 weeks old, were exposed to 0 (vehicle only), 150, 1500 or 2500 mg/kg APAP in 0.5% ethyl cellulose by oral gavage in two doses to increase absorption. The animals were sacrificed after 6, 12 or 24 hours. Equal amounts of RNA from the blood from each of four vehicle-only treated animals at the 6 and 12 hour time point and from each of six vehicle-only treated animals at the 24 hour time point, were pooled for control gene expression.  The pooled controls were compared with individual treated animals at each dose and time period.  The samples were hybridized in duplicate for each individual rat for a total of 8 (exception due to insufficient RNA quality: 150 mg/kg APAP and 1500 mg/kg APAP at 12 hour time point only 3 animals) microarray chips per dose and time period. Experiments were performed according to the guidelines established in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and an approved Animal Study Protocol was on file prior to initiation of the study.
