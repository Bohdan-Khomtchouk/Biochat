TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cultured adipocytes treated with different types of asbestos fibers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that adipocytes can be triggered by asbestos fibers to produce an inflammatory response. Microarray-based gene expression analysis was thus carried out to identify potential inflammation-related candidates with altered expression in adipocytes following asbestos exposure. We found changes in the expression of some inflammation-related genes in adipocytes treated with the different types of asbestos fibers

DESIGN
Cultured adipocytes were treated with 3 different types of asbestos fibers: chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite fibers at 10 mg/cm2 for 72 hours. Physiological saline was used as a control. Microarray was performed with duplicate for each sample.
