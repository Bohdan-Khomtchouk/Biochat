TITLE
Hyperactive FOXO1 results in lack of tip stalk identity and deficient microvascular regeneration

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Inhibition of FOXO1 activity in kidney microvascular endothelial cells improves angiogenesis

DESIGN
Kidney microvascular endothelial cells were serum starved and treated with DMSO control or FOXO1 inhibitor for one hour, then stimulated with VEGF for 30 minutes

PLATFORM
