Genome-wide transcript profiling for native porcine valvular interstitial cells and those cultured on TCPS and treated with TGF-β1

SUMMARY
Fibrotic diseases have significant health impact and have been associated with differentiation of the resident fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. In particular, stiffened extracellular matrix and TGF-β1 in fibrotic lesions have been shown to promote pathogenic myofibroblast activation and progression of fibrosis in various tissues. To better understand the roles of mechanical and chemical cues on myofibroblast differentiation and how they may crosstalk, we cultured primary valvular interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from porcine aortic valves and studied how traditional TCPS culture, which presents a non-physiologically stiff environment, and TGF-β1 affect native VIC phenotypes. We carried out gene expression profiling using porcine genome microarrays from Affymetrix and found that traditional TCPS culture induces major changes in gene expression of native VICs, rendering these cells more activated and similar to cells treated with TGF-β1. We also monitored time-dependent effects induced by TGF-β1 by examining gene expression changes induced by TGF-β1 at 8 hours and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Porcine aortic VICs were isolated and cultured with or without TGF-β1 treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We included 3 biological replicates for each condition. P0 VICs were freshly isolated cells which had not been cultured. P2 VICs were cells that had been passaged 2 times and cultured on plastic plates in low serum media. Some of the P2 VICs were treated with TGF-β1 at 5ng/ml for 8 hours or 24 hours. All the control and TGF-β1-treated conditions were collected at the same time on day 3 of culture.
