SUMMARY
Investigate gene expression profiles of Liuwei Dihuang Pill treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis with kidney Yin deficiency in peripheral blood

DESIGN
Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LDP), a classic Chinese medicinal formula, has been used to treat PMO with kidney YIN deficiency for three months. Whole human genome oligo microarray were applied to explore the differentially expressed genes before and after LDP treatment.
