TITLE
Nfib promotes Metastasis through a Widespread Increase in Chromatin Accessibility [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe Nfib as an important regulator of chromatin accessibility in SCLC.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq on three cell lines with either knockdown of Nfib expression or overexpression of Nfib. Cell lines 16T and KP1 were expressing iether a control vector or a vector expressing shRNA to Nfib, in duplicate Cell line KP22 were expressing either an empty vector or a vector expressing Nfib cDNA, in duplicate.

PLATFORM
