TITLE
A study of alterations in DNA epigenetic modifications (5mC and 5hmC) and gene expression influenced by simulated microgravity in human lymphoblastoid cells [meDIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, in this study we systematically examined the patterns of DNA methylation and hydroxy-methylation with its functional implications in gene regulation for the cultured TK6 lymphoblastoid cells upon exposure to micro-gravity conditions. theThe results reported here indicate that simulated microgravity alters methylation  patterns in a limited way  and subsequently the expression of genes involved in stress response like ATF3, FBXO17, MAP3K13 and VCL in TK6 cells.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different DNA modifications with 2 replicates each for 1 cell type
