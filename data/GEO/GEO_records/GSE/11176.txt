TITLE
Estimation of miRNAs

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Our analyses of microRNA expression profiles involve the hybridization of fluorescently labeled miRNA samples to custom made, DNA microarrays based on the GAPSII coated slides.  We hybridized different amounts of microRNAs from the mirVana miRNA Reference Panel v9.1 to microarrays. Keywords: Expression

DESIGN
Three different concentrations of miRNAs from the commercial standrads were labelled and hybridized to three microarrays.
