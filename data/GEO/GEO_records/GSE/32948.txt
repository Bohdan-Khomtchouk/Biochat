TITLE
Catabolite repression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by a zinc finger protein under biotin- and pyruvate carboxylase-deficient conditions in Pichia pastoris

ORGANISM
Komagataella pastoris

SUMMARY
We have identified a methanol- and biotin-starvation-inducible zinc finger protein named ROP  [repressor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)] in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia  pastoris. When P.pastoris strain GS115 (wild-type, WT) is cultured in biotin-deficient, glucose ammonium  (Bio-) medium, growth is suppressed due to the inhibition of anaplerotic synthesis of  oxaloacetate, catalysed by the biotin-dependent enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Deletion of  ROP results in a strain (∆ROP) that can grow under biotin-deficient conditions due to  derepression of a biotin- and PC-independent pathway of anaplerotic synthesis of oxaloacetate.  Northern analysis as well as microarray expression profiling of RNA isolated from WT and ∆ROP  strains cultured in Bio(-) medium indicate that expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate  carboxykinase gene (PEPCK) is induced in ∆ROP during biotin- or PC-deficiency even under  glucose-abundant conditions. There is an excellent correlation between PEPCK expression and  growth of ∆ROP in Bio(-) medium, suggesting that ROP-mediated regulation of PEPCK may have  a crucial role in the biotin- and PC-independent growth of the ∆ROP strain. To our knowledge,  ROP is the first example, of a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the catabolite repression  of PEPCK in yeast cells cultured under biotin- or PC-deficient and glucose-abundant conditions.
