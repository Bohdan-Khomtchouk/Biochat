TITLE
C. elegans embryonic timecourse in wt and mutant embryos

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This series of samples comprises multiple early embryonic time courses for C. elegans.  Time courses consisting of 10 time points each for 4 different genotypes are included: wild-type  (strain N2 grown on E. coli strain OP50), pie-1(zu154) (progeny of homozygous mutant mothers [Unc] of strain JJ532 grown on E. coli strain OP50), pie-1(zu154);pal-1(RNAi) (progeny of homozygous mutant mothers [Unc] of strain JJ532 grown on E. coli strain HT115 expressing pal-1 hairpin RNA), and mex-3(zu155);skn-1(RNAi) (progeny of homozygous mutant mothers [Dpy] of strain JJ518 grown on E. coli strain HT115 expressing skn-1 hairpin RNA).  Embryos were manually staged by morphology at the 4-cell stage and allowed to develop in water for defined amounts of time at 22 degrees C.  RNA was amplified as described (Baugh et al. Development, 2003; Baugh et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 2001).  This series of samples comprises all replicate data reported by Baugh et al. (Development, 2005). Keywords: time-course
