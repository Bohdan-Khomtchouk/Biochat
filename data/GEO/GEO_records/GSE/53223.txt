TITLE
Discrimination of dysplastic nevi from common melanocytic nevi by cellular and molecular criteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular and molecular differences between DNs and CMNs are not completely understood.  Using cDNA microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry, we molecularly characterized DNs and analyzed the difference between DNs and CMNs.

DESIGN
total RNA was extratced from sliced full thickness tissue samples for both nevi samples.  total RNA was extratced from bulk puch biopsy samples for normal skin.
