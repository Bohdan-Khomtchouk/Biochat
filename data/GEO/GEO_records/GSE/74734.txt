TITLE
An Integrated Metabolic Atlas of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in cellular metabolism contribute to the development and progression of tumors, and can render tumors vulnerable to interventions. However, studies of human cancer metabolism remain limited due to technical challenges of detecting and quantifying small molecules, the highly interconnected nature of metabolic pathways, and the lack of designated tools to analyze and integrate metabolomics with other â€“omics data. Our study generates the largest comprehensive metabolomics dataset on a single cancer type, and provides a significant advance in integration of metabolomics with sequencing data. Our results highlight the massive re-organization of cellular metabolism as tumors progress and acquire more aggressive features. The results of our work are made available through an interactive public data portal for cancer research community.
