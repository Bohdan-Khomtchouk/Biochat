TITLE
Gene expression profile in root and flower mediated by GLUCOSE-INHIBITED ROOT ELONGATION1 (GIR1)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated the glucose-inhibited root elongation1 (gir1) mutant from a genetic screen of activation T-DNA tagged seeds grown on 6% glucose agar plates. The gir1 mutant showed short swollen root phenotype at the presence of glucose and had a sever sterility when grown in soil. To better understand the molecular basis of GIR1-mediated gene expression, the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip was used to analyze the gene expression profiling in the gir1 mutant. The results showed that cell wall, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolic or transporter-related genes were altered expression pattern. These data suggest that GIR1 regulates root and flower growth and development through cell wall modification and, perhaps, membrane trafficking.

DESIGN
For root microarray assay [Samples GSM402178-GSM402183], wild type and the gir1 mutant plants were vertically grown on 0% glucose agar plates for 11 days, then transferred to 4% glucose plates for another ten days. Subsequently, the root tissues were excised for GeneChip analysis. In the case of inflorescence microarray assay [Samples GSM402184-GSM402191], plants were grown in soil for 33 days. The opened and opening flowers were discarded and the remaining inflorescence was harvested for GeneChip analysis.
