TITLE
Correlated DNA methylation clusters in whole blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation level was studied to identify the clustering of correlated DNA methylation at CpGs in whole blood. We used Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to identify the clustering of correlated DNA methylation in whole blood from normal individuals from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from normal individuals were hybridized to the Illumina Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
