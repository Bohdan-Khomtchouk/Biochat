TITLE
DNA Damage Induces a Secretory Program in the Quiescent Tumor Microenvironment that Promotes Adverse Prostate Cancer Phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Benign quiescent cells in the tumor microenvironment respond to genotoxic stress by inducing a secretory program capable of promoting therapy resistance. Developing approaches to suppress the secretory program may improve treatment responses.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile proliferating, quiescent, and ionizing-radiation treated PSC27 human primary prostate fibroblast cells.  RNA was amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines.
