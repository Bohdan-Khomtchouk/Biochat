TITLE
Analysis of JmjD2d-bound regions in unstimulated and stimulated dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine JmjD2d-binding, ChIP was performed using monoclonal antibodies specific for JmjD2d, or for the JmjN domain of all JmjD2-family members.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for JmjD2d, Jmjd2-family, and input DNA controls, from dendritic cells under 2 conditions (unstimulated & stimulated)
