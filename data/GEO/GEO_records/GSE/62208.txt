TITLE
Expression data from IL-1β-stimulated immature human enterocytes treated with probiotic-conditioned media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The conditioned media from Bifidobacterium infantis (BCM) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LCM) were reported to promote maturation of innate immune response gene expression, which explained the protective effects of probiotics in clinical necrotizing enterocolitis. We used microarray analysis to investigate the expression of genes involved in regulation of BCM and LCM in IL-1β stimulated immature human enterocytes. The H4 cells (a human nontransformed primary intestinal epithelial cell line) were pretreated with BCM or LCM (15%) for 30 minutes, and then stimulated with or without IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 4 h. Cell media and IL-1β stimulation were negative and positive control, respectively. RNA was extracted for mcroarray analysis.

DESIGN
A total of six treatments (triplicates for each) were included in this study. As one RNA sample in IL-1β-stimulated cells treated with BCM was dropped due to bad quality, seventeen samples were analyzed.  Various treatments were compared to the nagative control (cell media alone). Genes with  a fold-change ≥2 and a p value ≤ 0.05 were selected.
