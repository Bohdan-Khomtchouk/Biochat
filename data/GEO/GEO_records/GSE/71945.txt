TITLE
Expression data from porcine kidney cell (PK15) transfected by the plasmids

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Several recombinat viruses of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2),including P1, P2, ZJ-R, VL258, and VL264, have been found. The PK15 cells were transfected by the molecular clones of the abovementioned viruses, where specific sets of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct functions of viruses or viral proteins.

DESIGN
PK15 cells were selected at 12 hours post-transfection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the gene expression patterns of PK15 cells transfected with different molecular clones of the viruses.
