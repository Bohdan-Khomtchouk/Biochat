TITLE
DNA Methylation profile for male SD Rats with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) by RNA-Seq, batch2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of TBI on affecting DNA methylations in the WBC of male SD rats by RRBS.

DESIGN
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats weighing between 200 and 240 g were housed in cages and maintained in environmentally-controlled rooms (22–24C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle. After acclimatization for 1 week on standard rat chow, the rats were subjected to TBI by fluid percussion injury (FPI), sham surgery or non-procedure control.  At 1 week post-surgery the rats were tested for learning abilities, and then were sacrificed by decapitation. The fresh tissues including the hippocampus and white blood cells (WBC) were collected, processed, flash frozen, and stored at -70°C for later transcriptome and DNA methylome sequencing experiments.   All experiments were performed in accordance with the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of California at Los Angeles Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee.
