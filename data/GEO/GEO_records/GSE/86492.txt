TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human monocytes co-cultured with adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study analyzed the differentiation and polarization of human monocytes regulated by factors released from adipocytes (termed adipokines) at the gene expression level. The hypothesis was that adipokines affect differentiation and M1/M2 polarization of human monocytes. Results revealed interesting up- and down-regulated genes related to the differentiation and M1/M2 polarization of human monocytes in response to adipokines.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from monocytes co-cultured for 24 or 48 h with SGBS preadipocytes or adipocytes (after 2 weeks of differentiation).
