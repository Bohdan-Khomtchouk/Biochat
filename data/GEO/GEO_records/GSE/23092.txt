TITLE
EpiChip: Gene-by-gene quantification of epigenetic modification levels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using datasets for the H3KAc histone modification in Th2 cells and an accompanying IgG control, we present an analysis strategy termed 'EpiChip' that alternates between single gene and global data distribution levels and allows a clear distinction between experimental background and signal.

DESIGN
Examination of H3KAc histone modifications in one cell type plus an IgG control.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
