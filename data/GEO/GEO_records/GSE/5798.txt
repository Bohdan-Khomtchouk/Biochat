TITLE
In vivo gene expression in granulosa cells during pig terminal follicular development.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is the identification of genes and gene networks involved in pig ovarian follicular development. cDNA nylon micro-arrays (2849 sequenced clones) were designed from different libraries : four subtractive suppressive hybridization libraries (generated from small versus large and small versus medium follicles) and a pig multi-tissue cDNA library. Granulosa cells were isolated from healthy follicles (small, medium or large), 24 h or 96 h after the end of a progestagen treatment. The RNA isolated from these cells was used to hybridize the micro-arrays and hybridisations were performed in duplicate. The images were quantified using Bzscan software and the data were managed with BASE software. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Keywords: cell type comparison
