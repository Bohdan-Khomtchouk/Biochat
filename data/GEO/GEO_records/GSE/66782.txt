TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of LPS or PBS challenged DUSP3-KO and WT female mice peritoneal macrophages gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile in peritoneal macrophage extracted from LPS or PBS challenged DUSP3-/- and WT mice.  DUSP3 deletion protects mice from sepsis and endotoxemia. We performed a microarray analysis to get insights into the differentially regulated pathways between WT and KO under inflammatory conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated peritoneal macrophages isolated from DUSP3-/- and WT mice 36 hours after challenging them in vivo with PBS or with 6mg/kg of LPS.
