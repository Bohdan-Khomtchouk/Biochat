TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Human 293 embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells transfected with 2 different siRNAs against WRN mRNA compared to cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. The gene responsible for WS when mutated is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair. We depleted the human WRN protein in HEK293 cells by transfecting them with small interference RNAs (siRNAs) against the WRN mRNA. The transcription profile of these transfected cells was compared to the transcription profile of HEK293 cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA that does not deplete the WRN protein.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed on HEK293 cells transfected with the siRNA against WRN mRNA (siWRN385 molecule 5'-UUAACCAGACUGUUAAGGCUCCAGG-3 (HSS111385, Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) or with a second siRNA against WRN mRNA ( siWRN387 molecule 5'-AUUAUAACAAUGCUCUUUGGUGCCC-3' (HSS111387, Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). HEK293 cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA that does not recognize the WRN mRNA was used as reference. Dye swap was also performed.
