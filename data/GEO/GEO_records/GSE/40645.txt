Vastus lateralis muscle aging

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of a method to identify age-regulated expression trends in skeletql muscles and study the underlying molecular processes of the age_associated progressive changes in skeletal muscles. See abstract from associated manuscript belowÂ :  Aging is characterized by progressive tissue degeneration and it is associated with genome-wide changes of mRNA expression profiles. Therefore, it is expected that age-regulated changes in expression profiles could describe the process of aging. We have developed a robust and unbiased methodology to identify age-regulated expression trends in cross-sectional data sets from healthy donors. Our analysis in four different tissues reveals that in brain cortex and Vastus lateralis muscles, two major age-associated expression inclinations were found, one during midlife and one in elderly. In kidney medulla and cortex, however, transcriptional changes were found only in elderly. In concurrence with increased degeneration in aged tissue, the elderly-associated expression changes are predominantly downwards. Our results suggest that a non-linear trend describes the aging process, and can be the result of inclinations of gene expression at two distinct age-positions affecting different molecular and cellular processes.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from vastus lateralis muscles. cDNA synthesis and labeling were preformed with the Illumina cDNA labeling kit.
