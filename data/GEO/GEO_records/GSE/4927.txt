TITLE
Effect of OMP on gene expression in the olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OMP is expressed only in mature olfactory sensory neurons, arguing that its function is specially suited to the needs of OSNs. However none of the properties of OMP suggest any direct role in regulating gene expression in OSNs. Our data confirms that gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of  mice lacking OMP is indistinguishable from mice expressing OMP. We used affymerix M430v2.0 gene chips to cover as much of genome as possible and observed no statistically significant differences in mRNA abundance between the two genotypes.These results imply that OMPs ability to regulate signal transduction with in OSNs has little effect on gene expression and that its ability to promote mitosis in neighbouring cells (under culture conditions) is insufficiently active under normal laboratory housing conditions to generate detectable differences in gene expression patterns.
