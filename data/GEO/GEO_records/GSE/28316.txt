TITLE
Oxygen regulation of immunogenicity in primary human glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination is a powerful approach for cancer immunotherapy that has recently obtained regulatory approval, and tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. Tumor cell lysates (TLs) are often generated from cells cultured in atmospheric oxygen (~20% O2), which is roughly four-fold higher than that of the tumor in situ. We analyzed the expression patterns of glioma cells cultured in 5% Oxygen, 20% Oxygen and the primary tumors which the cell cultures were derived.

DESIGN
Total RNA from primary resected glioma tumors or tumor cells cultured in in either 5% oxygen or 20% oxygen

PLATFORM
GPL6883 Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 expression beadchip
