TITLE
Identification of luteinizing hormone regulated genes in the primate corpus luteum

ORGANISM
Macaca radiata

SUMMARY
Corpus luteum (CL) is an ephemeral gland whose main function is to secrete progesterone required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. It is very well established that development and maintenance of CL function in primates requires action of luteinizing hormone (LH) but the extent and mechanism by which LH contributes to the maintenance of CL function through out the luteal phase is not known. To study the nuclear actions mediated by LH, we evaluated global genomic changes in CL of monkeys treated with GnRH receptor antagonist to inhibit pituitary LH secretion. Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed on RNA samples from CL obtained from VEH or CET treated monkeys. Results demonstrate that LH regulates expression of a number of genes which might be important for maintenance of CL structure and function. Keywords: CL, LH, CET, gene expression

DESIGN
A single s.c. injection of GnRH receptor antagonist, Cetrorelix (CET), administered at a dose of 150 Âµg/kg BW has been shown to induce luteolysis. For the purpose of microarray analysis, VEH (5.25% glucose) or CET (treatment) was injected to female monkeys on day 7 of luteal phase and CL collected at 24 h post treatment (n=3) was cut into small quarters and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. To minimize between animal variations, CL for both VEH and CET treatments were collected from the same monkeys.
