TITLE
Ikaros deficient mouse thymic lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset comprises expression profiles from 3 thymic lymphomas from Ikaros deficient mice (IkL/L model, see Dumortier et al, Mol. Cell. Biol. 26, 209-220, 2006 for a description of the tumor model) and 3 thymic lymphomas from IkL/L mice that harbor a mutation of the Notch1 gene (deletion of floxed sequences comprising the promoter and exon 1 with the CD4-Cre transgene). The results from this experimpent is that the expression of Notch target genes was unexpectedly not altered in the tumors with the Notch1 deletion. This result is explained by the activation of a cryptic 3' Notch1 promoter in the deleted tumors, which leads to constitutive Notch1 activation. These results are described in the following publication: R Jeannet, J Mastio, B Macias-Garcia, A Oravecz, T Ashworth, AS Geimer-Lelay, B Jost, S Le Gras, J Ghysdael, T Gridley, T Honjo, F Radtke, J Aster, S Chan and P Kastner.

DESIGN
Primary thymic tumors from 3 IkL/L Notch1+/+ CD4-Cre+ mice (aged 18-20 weeks) were compared to similar tumors from 3 IkL/L Notch1f/f CD4-Cre+ mice (aged 8-10 weeks).
