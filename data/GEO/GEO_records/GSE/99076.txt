TITLE
Gene knockout of Zmym3 in mice arrests spermatogenesis at meiotic metaphase with defects in spindle assembly checkpoint

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular bases for the infertile phenotype of Zmym3 KO mice at the mRNA expression level, we carried out RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on cultured spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), c-KIT+ pre-meiotic cells induced from SSCs and spermatocytes directly isolated from adult mouse testes.

DESIGN
The cells used for RNA-Seq analysis including SSCs from Zmym3 WT and KO mice (SSC:WT and SSC:KO), c-KIT+ pre-meiotic cells induced from SSCs (c-KIT+ WT and c-KIT+:KO) and spermatocytes from 5- and 7-month mice (5m-SC:WT, 5m-SC:KO, 7m-SC:WT and 7m-SC:KO).
