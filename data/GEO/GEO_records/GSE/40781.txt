TITLE
CD3/CD28 Stimulated versus unstimulated Double-negative T Cells From Sooty Mangabeys

ORGANISM
Cercocebus atys

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Double Negative (CD4-/CD8-) T-cells isolated from SIV infected Sooty Mangebys. DN T-cells were stimulated through the T-Cell receptor using anti CD3/CD28 antibodies for 4 hours and compared to unstimulated DN T-cells.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, Stimulated vs Unstimulated. 4 animals tested, each with Stim vs Unstim, a dye flip of Stim vs Unstim, Stim vs Stim and Unstim vs Unstim.

PLATFORM
GPL16026 Agilent-026806 M. mulatta (Rhesus) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
