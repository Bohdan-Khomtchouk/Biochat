TITLE
RNA sequencing of C. elegans lsm-1(tm3585) mutants at L3 stage

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of a population of wild type animals and lsm-1 mutants at L3 stage

DESIGN
lsm-1(tm3585) mutants were backcrossed three times with wild type N2 animals. lsm-1 mutants and N2 animals were grown for 26 hours at 25C from a synchronized L1 population.
