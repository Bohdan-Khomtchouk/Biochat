TITLE
Effect of Evi-1 deletion in hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of Evi-1 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we carried out genome-wide transcriptional analysis using wild-type and Evi-1-deleted HSCs.

DESIGN
Lineage(-), Sca-1(+), c-Kit(+) cells derived from Evi-1(flox/flox) mice were transduced with GFP or Cre-GFP expressing retroviruses. GFP(+) cells were sorted and  and analyzed by Affymetrix® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array® for gene expression. Two independent experiments were performed.
