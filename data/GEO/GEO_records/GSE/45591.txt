TITLE
Mock and stably infected rKSHV.219 cells (LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC) [Expt2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 8 ; Human herpesvirus 8 strain rKSHV.219

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of stably infected primary endothelial cells using a custom tiling microarray. LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC were infected with rKSHV.219 and selected with puromycin for 2 weeks. Mock infected LEC, BEC, HUVEC, and HAEC served as controls for their infected counterparts. All cells were harvested after 2 weeks of stable infection.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: mock infected vs. stably infected cells. Four cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL16894 Agilent-029238 KSHV tiling microarray
