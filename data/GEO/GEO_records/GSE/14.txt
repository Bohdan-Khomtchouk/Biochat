SUMMARY
This series represents the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project SAGE library collection.  Libraries contained herein were either produced through CGAP funding, or donated to CGAP. The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP: http://cgap.nci.nih.gov ) is an interdisciplinary program established and administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI: http://www.nci.nih.gov ) to generate the information and technological tools needed to decipher the molecular anatomy of the cancer cell. SAGE libraries are named according to the following convention: * SAGE_Organ_histology_code_unique identifier, e.g., SAGE_Colon_adenocarcinoma_CL_Caco2 * Codes: B = bulk; CL = cell line; CS = short-term cell culture; MD = micro-dissected; AP = antibody purified. These libraries were downloaded from the CGAP Web site on March 17, 2009 This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
