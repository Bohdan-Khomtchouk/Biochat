TITLE
Response of Rhodopirellula baltica to heat shock

ORGANISM
Rhodopirellula baltica

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the stress response of the marine Planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica after a temperature up-shift. R. baltica cultures were grown at 28°C and then shifted to 37°C. Samples were taken after 10, 20, 40, 60 and 300min and compared with cultures before the up-shift (28°C). Time series experiment, whole genome array

DESIGN
5 time points, 3 replicates per time point. Each time point sample was compared with the reference. 3 self-self reference hybridizations. In total, 18 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL7654 Max Planck Institute, Whole Genome Array for Rhodopirellula baltica SH1T 7.4K version 1
