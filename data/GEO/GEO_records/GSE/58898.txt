TITLE
T cell responses to H1N1v and a longitudinal study of seasonal influenza vaccination - 2010

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systems biology approach to examine effects of seasonal flu vaccination in adults of different ages on gene expression, cytokine stimulation and serum cytokines with parameters such as immune senescence to uncover new markers and mechanisms behind failure of immune function in many older people.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from whole-blood lysates obtained from individuals immediately prior to vaccination against seasonal influenza, followed by depletion of globin messenger RNA. The goal was to evaluate potential gene expression signatures at Day 0 associated with immune senescence.
