TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 and MCF7-LTED cells treated with YC-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel therapeutic opportunities for patients with acquired resistance to endocrine treatments in breast cancer, we applied a high-throughput drug screen. The IC50 values were determined for MCF7 and MCF7-LTED cells.

DESIGN
MCF7 and LTED cells were treated with YC-1 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
