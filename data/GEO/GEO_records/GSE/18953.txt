TITLE
Effects of IGF 1 on MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the effects of IGF 1 on MCF 7 breast cancer cells, we cultured pre-starved MCF 7 cells with or without 50ng/ml IGF 1 for 24 h. We then profiled gene expression changes using Human Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (HEEBO) microarrays. After stimulation, total RNA was extracted and amplified using a modified Eberwine procedure. The amplified RNA was labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5 and pooled with Cy3 labeled reference RNA, and then the pooled RNA was hybridized onto HEEBO microarrays. After hybridization and washing, arrays were scanned on a fluorescent microscope scanner.

DESIGN
An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract.
