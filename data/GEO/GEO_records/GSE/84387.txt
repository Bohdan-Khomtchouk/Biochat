TITLE
Gene expression data of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in myelofibrosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stromal cells are a critical component of the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell niche. In myelofibrosis, these cells are the major source of fibrosis in the bone marrow. We performed gene expression analysis using microarrays to systematically elucidate the mechanisms leading to fibrogenic conversion of these cells.

DESIGN
Myelofibrosis was induced in Cxcl12-DsRed/+ reporter mice using Tpo-overexpressing retrovirus. Mesenchymal stromal cells were flow cytometrically sorted and subjected to microarray analysis. Mesenchymal stromal cells sorted from control virus infected Cxcl12-DsRed/+ mice were used as controls.
