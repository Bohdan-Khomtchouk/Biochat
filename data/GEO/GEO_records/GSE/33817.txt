TITLE
X-QTL performed on wild-type and sup35 (C653R) BY x RM segregants in various growth conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genotyping pools of wildtype(wt) or sup35-C653R(sup35) BYxRM segregants after growth on YPD (control) or YPD+drug-of-interest(selection) 10 Growth conditions tested are control (YPD alone), and YPD plus the following drugs: Chlorpromazine, CoCl2, Cycloheximide, Diamide, E6berbamine, Ethanol, H2O2, Neomucin, and Tunicamycin.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs selection. 6 biological replicates for control and two biological replicates for each selection included.

PLATFORM
