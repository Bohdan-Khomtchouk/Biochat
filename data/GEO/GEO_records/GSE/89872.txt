TITLE
A cost-effective RNA sequencing protocol for large-scale gene expression studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a simple RNA sequencing protocol with substantially reduced costs.

DESIGN
This protocol uses as little as 10â€…ng of total RNA, allows multiplex sequencing of up to 96 samples per lane, and is strand specific. H1p16 (3 replicates) and H1p43 (3 replicates) are sequenced by Illumina TruSeq. Lane1 - Lane 4 are sequenced by LM-Seq (Hou, Zhonggang, et al. 2015). Lane 1 - Lane 4 samples are multiplexed by 95, 48, 24 and 6 samples per lane, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
