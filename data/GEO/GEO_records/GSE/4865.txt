TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between GnRH-treated and control rat pituitary organ cultures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat pituitary organ cultures were treated with either GnRH at 10nM for 6 hours, or treated with control for 6 h, both groups in triplicate; samples were processed to generate total RNA, which were subsequently analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix rat 230 2.0 arrays Keywords: rat pituitary organ culture treated vs control

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression profiles between GnRH-treated and control rat pituitary organ cultures

PLATFORM
