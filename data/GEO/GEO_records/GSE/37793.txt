TITLE
Transcriptome of sevenless (sev) in the eye imaginal disc.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Sevenless receptor (Sev) is a key component of the complex regulatory network involved in R7 photoreceptor determination. However the genetic program that responds to Sev is still unknown. Here, we explore the transcriptional profile downstream of Sev, using eye imaginal discs from third instar larvae of the sev mutants sevS11 and sevd2 compared with wild-type controls. Keywords: loss and gain of function analysis

DESIGN
Eye imaginal discs from alleles sevd2 and sevS11 were dissected. Four microarrays were hybridized for sevd2 and three for sevS11 (total of 7 experiments) in biological replicate pairs, such that the total RNA from the sample used as a starting material came from different extractions. Both arrays from each pair were hybridized with the same amplified RNA from sample and common reference (obtained using the Amino-Allyl Messageamp II aRNA Amplification Kit from Ambion, Inc) but with dyes (Cy3 and Cy5 from Amersham, Inc) swapped to take dye-bias into account.
