TITLE
A cyanobacterial LPS antagonist prevents endotoxin shock and blocks sustained TLR4 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A cyanobacterial LPS antagonist prevents endotoxin shock and blocks sustained TLR4 stimulation required for cytokine expression.  We report the identification and biologic characterization of an LPS-like molecule extracted from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria Planktothrix FP1 (CyP). Keywords: different ligands

DESIGN
2 untreated (CTR), 2 treated with LPS at 3h, 2 treated with CyP at 1h,  2 treated with CyP at 3h, 2 treated with LPS + CyP at 3h

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
