TITLE
miRNAs:Biomarkers of Storage Lesions of RBC.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of  miRNA expression level changes in RBCs stored for 20 days, RBCs stored for 20 days with 1uM SNP, compared to healthy,male type O donors, and to explore the mechanism of storage lesions of RBC.

DESIGN
In this study, nine samples from three healthy, male type O donors, three donors whose RBCs stored for 20 days, and three donors whose RBCs stored for 20 days with 1uM SNP were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling, and to explore the mechanism of storage lesions of RBC.

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
