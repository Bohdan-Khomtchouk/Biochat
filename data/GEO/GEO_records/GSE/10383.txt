SUMMARY
rs06-06_mirna - flg22 treatment & mutants - Time course : What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? miRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of microRNA mutants? siRNA : What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of siRNA mutants? - What are the genes (incuding microRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated upon flg22 treatment? 14-day old seedlings treated with flg22 (flagellin- derived peptide). Keywords: time course,total transcriptome knowledge
