TITLE
Expression Data from Bone Marrow Progenitor-Derived Adipocytes, White Adipocytes and Brown Adipocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified a population of adipocytes in fat tissue that arise from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression patterns of the bone marrow progenitor-derived adipocytes as well as conventional white and brown adipocytes to evaluate the relationship between these adipocyte subpopulations.

DESIGN
Gonadal fat tissue (for white adipocytes) and intrascapular fat tissue (for brown adipocytes) was digested with collagenase and adipocytes were recovered by centrifugation/flotation.  Bone marrow derived adipocytes were isolated from the adipocyte fraction of gonadal fat tissue from mice receiving bone marrow tranplants from donors expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-galactosidase (LacZ) by flow cytometry.
