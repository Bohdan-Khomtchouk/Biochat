TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptomics_Human_Single supratherapeutic dose of acetaminophen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This was a controlled pilot study of 9 healthy adults admitted to the General Clinical Research Center at the University of North Carolina Hospital. After 3 days of clinical acclimatization, 6 subjects received a single 4g bolus dose or a placebo. Peripheral blood was collected on each day preceeding dosage, and then 6, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post dosing. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed for differential gene expression on Agilent Human 1vA2 microarray chips.

DESIGN
7.5 mls (2.5 ml in 3 PAXgene tubes) of blood were collected at each time point. Total RNA was amplified and labeled according to Agilent protocols and a single chip was run using a referenced design with Stratagenes Universal Human reference RNA. Each patient was normalized to there own 0 hr data. Significant differential expression was determined by comparing  APAP treated subjects to placebos.
