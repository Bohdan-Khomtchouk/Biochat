TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis reveals adaptive changes of hibernating retinas in 13-lined ground squirrel

ORGANISM
Ictidomys tridecemlineatus

SUMMARY
Hibernation is a seasonally adaptive strategy that allows hibernators to live through extreme cold condition and was viewed as a highly regulated physiological event. In spite of the profound reduction of blood flow to retina, hibernation causes no lasting retinal injury and hibernators show increased tolerance to ischemic insults during hibernation period. To understand the molecular changes of retina in response to hibernation we applied transcriptomic analysis to explore the changes of gene expression of 13-lined ground squirrel retinas during hibernation.

DESIGN
Retinas of active and hibernating ground squirrels were collected in July and August, and January and February, respectively. 6 hibernating animals, 4 awake animals were included.
