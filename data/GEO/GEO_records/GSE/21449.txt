TITLE
PAT-ChIP-Seq: a novel tool for the epigenetic profiling of formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pathology samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic alterations in the pattern of DNA and histone modifications play a crucial role in cancer development. Analysis of patient samples, however, is hampered by technical limitations in the study of chromatin structure from pathology archives that typically consist of heavily fixed, paraffin-embedded material.
