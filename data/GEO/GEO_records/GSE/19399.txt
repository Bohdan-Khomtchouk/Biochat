TITLE
Affymetrix 250K StyI SNP array data across multiple human cancer types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A powerful way to discover key genes playing causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. We have reported high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across multiple cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several candidate genes and families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including members of the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway. We show that cancer cells harboring amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend upon expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in multiple cancer types.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from 3,131 cancer DNAs derived from primary tissues or cell line material, as well as from DNA obtained from 1,480 normal DNA samples. Signal intensities were normalized to raw copy number estimates using the tangent normalization method, as described in Beroukhim et al., In Press and Mermel et al., In preparation. Data analysis across samples was performed using this GISTIC algorithm (Beroukhim R et al, PNAS 2007). The 250K SNP array data used in this study were obtained from several sources, including 2,327 previously or concurrently published data from our laboratory and other groups and 804 previously unpublished data from cancer and normal specimens (included in this submission).  The 2,327 published cancer copy-number profiles not included in our submission consist of data from the following publications (see below for full references): - 510 non-small cell lung cancers (Ramos et al 2009; GlaxoSmithKline; Bass et al; Weir et al; and Sos et al) - 388 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (GlaxoSmithKline; Mullighan et al 2007; Mullighan et al 2008) - 215 myeloproliferative disorders (Kilpivaara et al) - 130 breast cancers (GlaxoSmithKline; Haverty et al; Nikolsky et al) - 151 colorectal cancers (GlaxoSmithKline; Firestein et al) - 115 miscellaneous other types of cancer (GlaxoSmithKline) - 111 renal cancers (GlaxoSmithKline; Beroukhim et al) - 106 hepatocellular cancers (GlaxoSmithKline; Chiang et al) - 77 melanomas (GlaxoSmithKline; Lin et al) - 54 prostate cancers (GlaxoSmithKline; Demichelis et al) - 40 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (GlaxoSmithKline; Bass et al) - 31 neuroblastomas (GlaxoSmithKline; George et al) - 21 non-Hodkgin's lymphomas (GlaxoSmithKline) - 21 small cell lung cancers (GlaxoSmithKline) - 10 gliomas (GlaxoSmithKline) - 4 thyroid cancers (GlaxoSmithKline) - 2 medulloblastomas (GlaxoSmithKline) - 7 ovarian cancers (GlaxoSmithKline) - 212 sarcoma samples of various subtypes (Barretina et al, in review) - 73 esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (Ramos et al, in Preparation) - 26 mesotheliomas (Barchmann et al, in preparation) - 23 gastric cancer samples (GlaxoSmithKline; Ramos et al, in preparation).
