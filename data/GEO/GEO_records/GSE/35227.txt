TITLE
Conserved and Essential Transcription Factors for Cellulase Gene Expression in Ascomycete Fungi.

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa OR74A

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling with next-generation sequencing methods refined our understanding of the N. crassa transcriptional response to cellulose and demonstrated that the newly characterized transcription factors clr-1 and clr-2 were required for the bulk of that response including induction all major cellulase and some major hemicellulase genes.

DESIGN
N. crassa pregrown in Sucrose and transferred to Avicel (cellulose), Sucrose or media with no carbon added.  Biological triplicates used to identify differentially expressed genes in WT.  Single libraries for mutant strains identify which genes show deficient regulation in response to Avicel. Note: Samples named " cdr1 " and " cdr2 " correspond to the genes clr-1 and clr-2 respectively.
