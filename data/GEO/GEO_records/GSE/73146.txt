TITLE
Gene expression over the course of xylem tracheary element formation in cell suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression during the differentiation of cell suspension cultures into tracheary elements using the biological system published by Pesquet et al., Current Biology (2010): tracheary element differentiation was triggered by externally supplying hormone-free habituated cell suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 with auxin, cytokinin and epibrassinolides; RNA samples extracted from 3 independent time-courses every 12h from 0h to 4 days were analyzed using ATH1 Arabidopsis Affymetrix micro-array

DESIGN
Time-course design during tracheary element differentiation (3 independepent time-course were harvested from initiation 0h to 4 days every 12h) - total of 27 samples corresponding to the 3 replicates of 9 time point time-courses - gene expression was monitored along the time-course compared to 0h
