TITLE
Discovery of salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in gynecological diseases, and has been considered as one of the most fatal cancers due to lack of reliable detection strategy in the early stage. Therefore the capability to detect the morbidity initiation with an sensitive and effective approach is one of the most desirable goals for curing ovarian cancer. In this study, we used microarray technology for salivary mRNA biomarkers discovery, and evaluated the performance and translational utilities of discovered markers from a clinical study using an independent sample cohort . We used microarrays to profile and compare the gene expressions between ovairan cancer patient and matched controls, and identified seven down-regulated genes after the validation study.

DESIGN
To find salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for ovarian cancer, salivary transcriptomes in 11 ovarian cancer patients and 11 matched controls were profiled using Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus-2.0 array, and followed by t-test and fold-change analyses. The biomarker candidates selected from the microarray results were subjected to clinical validation using an independent sample cohort by RT-qPCR. The prediction power of biomarkers was analyzed by logistic regression approach
