TITLE
Differential gene expression of IMR32 cells expressing 69-kDa or 82-kDa CHAT proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to look at genes that were affected by 69-kDa and/or 82-kDa ChAT proteins in IMR32 cells Keywords: comparative

DESIGN
The gene expression changes of IMR32 cells stably expressing either 69-kDa or 82-kDa ChAT proteins were anaylzed and compared to control IMR32 wild type cells.  3 biological replicates were anaylzed per condition (69-kDa ChAT expressing cells, 82-kDa ChAT expressing cells, or wild type IMR32 cells) for a total of 9 samples altogether.
