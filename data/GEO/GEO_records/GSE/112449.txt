TITLE
Microarray analysis comparing gene expression of callus tissue extracted from either Cyp24a1-null mice or their control heterozygous littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D metabolite (24R,25D) has long been suspected of participating to bone fracture repair. We used Cyp24a1-deficient mice, unable to produce 24R25D, to observe gene expression in callus tissue compared to that of control littermates.

DESIGN
In total 6 samples; 3 from Cyp24a1-null mice with the corresponding control littermate samples

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
