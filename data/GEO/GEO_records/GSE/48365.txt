TITLE
S-adenosylmethionine modifies cocaine-induced DNA methylation and increases locomotor sensitization in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to investigate whether environmental factors like S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) via affecting epigenome could alter cocaine-induced gene expression and locomotor sensitization in mice. Using mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) tissue, whole-genome gene expression profiling revealed that repeated SAM treatment affected a limited number of genes, but significantly modified cocaine-induced gene expression by blunting nonspecifically the cocaine response. At the gene level, we discovered that SAM modulated cocaine-induced DNA methylation by inhibiting both promoter-associated CpG-island hyper- and hypomethylation in the NAc but not in the reference tissue cerebellum.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) tissue. Two tissues were combined to a sample, 4 samples per group used. RNA quality and quantity were assessed using the Nano-Drop -1000 spectrophotometer and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
