TITLE
Analysis of RNA distribution between pseudopodia and cell bodies in response to Fibronectin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify on a genome-wide scale RNAs that are enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells. For this, we employed a fractionation method in which cells are plated on a microporous filter whose bottom side only is coated with fibronectin. The cells thus polarize and extend pseudopodial protrusions towards the bottom surface. These protruding pseudopodia can then be physically isolated from the bottom surface of the filter and their contents compared with the remaining cell bodies, which are isolated from the upper surface of the filter. Keywords: comparative RNA distribution

DESIGN
We analyzed 2 independent pseudopodia samples (samples 06-23_PS_A and 06-23_PS_B) and 2 independent cell body samples (samples 06-23_CB_A and 06-23_CB_B)
