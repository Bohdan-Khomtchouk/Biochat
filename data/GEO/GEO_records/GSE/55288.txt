TITLE
Identification of interleukin-4 (IL-4) targets in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of CLL cells and normal B cells (NBC) treated for 18 hr with 10 ng/ml IL-4, compared with culture with nothing (Ctrl) and the basal (Pre) samples. Patient CLL01 was also treated with IL-4 plus 5 mg/ml ERK activation inhibitor peptide I, or IL-4 plus 10 µM NFkB activation inhibitor, and IL-4 plus 100 mg/ml cyclic-pifithrin-α

DESIGN
23 CLL patients (10 Pre samples, 23 Ctrl samples, 23 IL-4 samples, 1 IL-4 plus ERK inhibitor sample, 1 IL-4 plus NFkB inhibitor sample, 1 IL-4 plus Pifithrin sample), 13 NBC (10 Pre samples, 10 Ctrl samples, 13 IL-4 samples)
