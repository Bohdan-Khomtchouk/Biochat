TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and human iPSC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes whose expression levels are changed before and after somatic cell reprogramming, we performed global gene expression analysis of iPS cells and their original fibrobrasts.

DESIGN
RNAs were extracted from an iPS cell line (201B7) and its original human dermal fibroblast cell line (1388), and analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.
