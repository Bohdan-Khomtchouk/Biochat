TITLE
Donor T cells in ovarian graft versus host disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells purified from spleens and ovaries after murine syngeneic and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Infertility associated with ovarian failure is a serious late complication for female survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). While the role of pretransplant conditioning regimen has been well appreciated, increasing application of reduced-intensity conditioning facilitated us to revisit the other factors possibly affecting ovarian function after allogeneic SCT. We have addressed whether donor T-cell mediated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) could be causally related to female infertility in mice. To study transcriptomes of donor T cells infiltrating into the ovary, donor T cells were sorted from recipients' ovaries and microarray analysis was performed.
