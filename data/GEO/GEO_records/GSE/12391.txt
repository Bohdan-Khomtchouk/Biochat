Melanoma: comparison between common nevi, radial/vertical growth phase melanoma, metastases and dysplastic nevi

SUMMARY
Despite malignant cutaneous melanoma is relatively rare compared to other skin cancers, it is still responsible for 80% of all skin cancer-related deaths. To identify molecular signatures of melanoma progression, excisional biopsies from 18 common melanocytic nevi (CMN), 8 primary radial growth phase melanomas (RGPM), 15 primary vertical growth phase melanomas (VGPM) and 5 melanoma metastases (MTS) were profiled using whole genome oligo-microarrays. Differentially expressed genes for each progression step were identified, and validation of selected transcripts by qRT-PCR was performed on an independent cohort of fixed samples. The comparison between CMN and RGPM showed an enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to inter and intra-cellular junctions, whereas the transition from RGPM to VGPM was characterized by the deregulation of WNT3, MAPK and AKT pathways. In this step, enrichment analysis underlined the alteration of biological processes linked to apoptosis. Upregulation of genes involved into DNA double-strand breaks repair and downregulation of cellular adhesion genes were observed in MTS respect to VGPM. Futhermore, the gene expression profiles of 11 dysplastic nevi (DN) were compared to all the others. Some genes controlling proliferation were found more expressed than in CMN. Overall, DN displayed an heterogeneous behaviour, with relevant oncogenes, such as MYC and BCL6, less expressed than in RGPM, and a modulation pattern similar to VGPM for a subset of gene families, such as mismatch repair. This suggests that DN is not an intermediate step within melanoma progression, but a separate entity with an independent risk of progression to melanoma Keywords: Melanoma progression, gene expression profiling, qPCR
