TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone H2A.Z and its chaperone.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use ChIP-Seq technology to profile the occupancy of histone H2A.Z and its chaperone in HeLa cells genome wide to check if they are co-colocalized.

DESIGN
H2A.Z is ChIPed by antibody and its chaperone is tagged by Flag and ChIPed by M2 beads against Flag. ChIPed fragments are sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.
