TITLE
The E3 ubiquitin ligase DDB1 controls homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are regulated to keep the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. However, little is known about post-translational regulations in HSCs. In this study, we characterize the role of DDB1, a component of the Cul4A-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in HSCs and progenitors by using conditional DDB1 knockout models. We show that the maintenance and differentiation of both adult and fetal HSCs and progenitor cells is dependent on DDB1 function. Deletion of DDB1 alters cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, deletion of DDB1 in developing thymocytes had no effects on T cell differentiation, whereas DDB1-deficient peripheral T cells were not able to enter cell cycle when stimulated in vitro. In addition, DDB1 is essential for T cell leukemia initiation. Our results reveal that DDB1 is required for adult and fetal hematopoiesis as it controls progenitor and stem cell homeostasis. Transcriptional consequences of inactivating DDB1 in fetal LSK cells.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed: wild-type (WT) control and DDB1-deficient (DDB1) Lin-ckit+Sca1+ (LSK) cells sorted from fetal livers E16.5 of DDB1 flox/flox, VavCre+ and control mice.
