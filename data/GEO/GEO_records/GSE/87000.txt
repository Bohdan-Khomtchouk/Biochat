TITLE
Healthy glucocorticoid receptor N363S SNP carriers and metabolic syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in gene regulation between healthy glucocorticoid receptor N363S single nucleotide polymorphism carriers and noncarrier controls may underlie the emergence of metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease associated with the N363S polymorphism.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy glucocorticoid receptor N363S carriers and healthy noncarrier controls were differentiated to macrophages and treated with 100nM dexamethasone or vehicle for 6 hours.  RNA from seven N363S carriers and seven noncarrier controls were used for microarray analysis.
