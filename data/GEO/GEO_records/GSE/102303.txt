TITLE
Novel Insights into RNA Regulatory Function of MOV10 in Mammalian Germ Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA activity and its regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involve extremely complicated mechanisms that remain largely obscure. Here we report a comprehensive study of the molecular and biological functions of the RNA helicase MOV10 in postnatal mouse male germ cells. Genome-wide analysis of RNA targetome reveals that MOV10 predominantly binds to mRNAs with long 3'-UTR, and also interacts with various non-coding RNAs. Intriguingly, MOV10 associates with an array of nuclear factors involved in RNA splicing/processing networks, and its intronic binding sites tend to reside in proximity to splice sites. Knockdown and transplantation experiments show that reduction of MOV10 expression has a dramatic effect on the fate of spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs), limiting proliferation and in vivo repopulation capacity. This effect is concurrent with a global disturbance of RNA homeostasis and downregulation of a couple of factors critical for SPC proliferation and/or self-renewal. RNA-seq analysis further reveals MOV10 as an unexpected regulator for both miRNA generation and alternative splicing, the latter of which interconnects with multiple RNA regulation pathways. These data expand the landscape of MOV10 function and highlight a previously unidentified mechanism initiated from nucleus, suggesting MOV10 is a versatile RBP involved in a broader RNA regulatory network.
