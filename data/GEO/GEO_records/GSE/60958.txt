TITLE
Transcriptome dynamics and potential roles of Sox6 in the postnatal heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain an integrated view of the dynamic changes in gene expression during postnatal heart development at the organ level, time-series transcriptome analyses of the postnatal hearts of neonatal through adult mice (P1, P7, P14, P30, and P60) were performed using a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline. Additionally, the role of the transcription factor Sox6 in the postnatal maturation of cardiac muscle was investigated by differential transcriptome analyses between Sox6 knockout (KO) and control hearts.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cardiac ventricles of control (MCK-Cre) and Sox6 KO (Sox6loxp/loxp; MCK-Cre) mice at postnatal day 1 (P1), day 7 (P7), day 14 (P14), 1 month (P30), and 2 months (P60). Three biological replicates were prepared for each time point.
