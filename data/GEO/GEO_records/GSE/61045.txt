TITLE
Exogenous rescue of KLHL9 in SF210 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rescue of KLHL9 (WT) expression in KLHL9 null cell line, SF210, causes significant reprogramming away from a mesenchymal lineage.

DESIGN
An inducible expression vector carrying KLHL9 or GFP was stably introduced into SF210 cells via lentivirus transduction. Individual lines were isolated via clonal dilution and induced using doxycycline.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
