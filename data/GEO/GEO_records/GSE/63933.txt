TITLE
Onchocerca-derived small RNAs in host nodules and serum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the presence of Onchocerca ochengi and O. volvulus derived small RNAs in bovine nodule fluids and human serum and plasma, respectively. Further comparisons with other related filarial nematodes like Litomosoides sigmodontis and Dirofilaria immitis reveal common and distictive signatures associated to the Onchocerca species.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA content in bovine nodule fluids and human serum/plasma by Next Generation sequencing
