TITLE
Analysis of compartment-specific gene expression in breast cancer tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple-negative primary breast cancer tumors, rich in inflammatory stroma, were laser microdissected and global mRNA expression was analyzed in stroma compartment, cancer cell compartment, and in total tumor tissue.

DESIGN
Three FFPE breast cancer tumors wer laser microdissected and the cancer cell and stroma compartments were collected. A piece of t
