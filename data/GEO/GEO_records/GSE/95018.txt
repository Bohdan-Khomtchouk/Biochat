TITLE
Up- and downregulation of genes during ex vivo differentiation of human NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cord blood stem cells were expanded and differentiated to NK cells. Samples taken at different days after induction of differentiation were analyzed and compared to undifferentiated expanded stem cells. The most highly upregulated genes were further analyzed. Results based on the analyses have been published in Lehmann et al., Stem Cells Develop 21, 2926-38 (2012), Lehmann et al., PloS One 9, e87131 (2014) and Post et al., submitted (2017).

DESIGN
Human umbilical cord blood stem cells were  expanded for 10 days and then differentiation was induced by addition of IL15. At various days up to day 35 samples were taken and Affymetrix microarray performed.
