Expression data from Mesenchymal stem cells

SUMMARY
Abnormal osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis(AIS). However, the biological roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs are unknown. We used LncRNA microarray analyses of bone marrow (BM) MSCs from non-AIS patients and AIS patients and identified significant differentially expressed lncRNAs in AIS BM-MSCs.

DESIGN
Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were obtained from 12 AIS patients, and5 healthy donors)  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. In the AIS group, all of the patients underwent full clinical and radiological examinations to rule out other causes of scoliosis and to ascertain the diagnosis of AIS. In the control group, each of the 25 age- and gender-matched subjects had a straight spine and a normal forward bending test on the physical examination. They were confirmed to be free of any associated medical diseases or spinal deformities when entered to the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Written informed consents were obtained from all subjects and their parents before entering the study.
