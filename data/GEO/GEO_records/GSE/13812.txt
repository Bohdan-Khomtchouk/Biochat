TITLE
Consequences of an in utero TCDD exposure on the male reproductive function in 5 postnatal days rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Our project focuses on the effects of an in utero TCDD exposure on the male reproductive function. Keywords: transcriptionnal analysis

DESIGN
Pregnant rats were given either one oral dose of 2,3-7,8 TCDD (200 ng/kg) or equal volume of vehicule (sesame oil). Male rats were sacrified 5 postnatal days and testes were harvested. RNA were extracted with Rneasy mini kit. A pool of RNA from vehicule group was used as the reference group. Each rat submitted to TCDD was compared to reference group. Four biological replicates were processed in a dye swap experimental plan.
