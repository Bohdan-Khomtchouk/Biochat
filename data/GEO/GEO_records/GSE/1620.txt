TITLE
Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (mother cell)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
This series of experiments was designed to identify the program of gene transcription for a single differentiating cell type during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. The mother cell is one of two cell types generated by asymmetric division of sporulating cells approximately two hours after initiation of sporulation. The program is governed by a hierarchical cascade consisting of the transcription factors: sigmaE, sigmaK, GerE, GerR (YlbO) and SpoIIID. The characterization of the sigmaE regulon was reported in Eichenberger et al. (2003), J. Mol. Biol. 327, 945-972. Here we report the data for sigmaK, GerE, GerR and SpoIIID.
