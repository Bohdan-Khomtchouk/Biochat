TITLE
Transcriptomics of a novel trophoblast differentiation protocol applied to human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptomic dynamics and novel transcriptomic events discovered by using a novel protocol which differentiates human embryonic stem cells to the trophoblast lineage. We used five timepoints (day 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) to see the progression of differenciation. At each timepoint RNA was extracted, and poly A RNA-Seq was performed using ABI SOLiD technology.

DESIGN
Human embrynoic stem cells , exposed to the differenciation medium at five time points (day 0, 2,4,6,8)

PLATFORM
GPL9442 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Homo sapiens)
