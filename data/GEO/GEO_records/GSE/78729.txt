TITLE
CRISPResso: sequencing analysis toolbox for CRISPR genome editing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CRISPResso is a software pipeline for the analysis of targeted CRISPR-Cas9 deep sequencing data. This algorithm allows for the quantification of both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous directed repair (HDR) occurrences ( )

DESIGN
Cells nucleofected with either CRISPR/Cas9 alone or with CRISPR/Cas9 and a homologous donor template were subjected to targeted high-throughput sequencing of the beta-globin locus. Here, one sample with just CRISPR/Cas9 edited cells and 2 samples with CRISPR/Cas9 and donor edited cells were analyzed.
