TITLE
mRNA analysis of gene expression in adipose tissue to compare high fat fed sgp130Fc transgenic vs IL6 knock-out vs wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We want to analyse on a broad level the difference of gene expression in the adipose tissue between high fat fed sgp130Fc Transgenic which have no IL6 transsignalling and the IL6 knockout which have no IL6 signalling at all. Because the sgp130Tg mice show a marked adipogenic phenotype we want to compare it with the IL6 KO.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from flash frozen adipose tissue from obese, 5hr-fasted mice.
