Individual-specific and allele-specific chromatin signatures in diverse human populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains DNase-seq data and CTCF ChIP-seq data for 6 lymphoblastoid cell lines. There are 3 cell lines from a YRI trio and 3 lines from a CEU trio (HapMap GM19238, GM19239, GM 19240, GM12891, GM12892, GM12878). For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data from each of the 6 cell lines.
