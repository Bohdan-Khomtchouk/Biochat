TITLE
PML is a ROS sensor activating p53 upon oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PML nuclear bodies (NBs) recruit partner proteins -including p53 and  its regulators- controlling their abundance or function. Investigating arsenic sensitivity  of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we proposed that PML oxidation  promotes NB-biogenesis. Yet, physiological links between PML and oxidative  stress response in vivo remain unexplored. Here we identify PML as a reactive  oxygen species (ROS) sensor. Pml-/- cells accumulate ROS, while PML  expression decreases ROS levels. Unexpectedly, Pml-/- embryos survive acute  glutathione depletion. Moreover, Pml-/- animals are resistant to acetaminophen  hepatotoxicity or fasting-induced steatosis. Molecularly, Pml-/- animals fail to  properly activate oxidative stress-responsive p53 targets, while NRF2 response  is accelerated. Finally, in an oxidative stress-prone background, Pml-/- animals  display a longevity phenotype, likely reflecting decreased basal p53 activation.  Thus, similar to p53, PML exerts basal anti-oxidant properties, but also drives  oxidative stress-induced changes in cell survival/proliferation or metabolism in  vivo. Through NB-biogenesis, PML therefore couples ROS-sensing to p53  responses, shedding a new light on PML role in senescence or stem cell  biology.
