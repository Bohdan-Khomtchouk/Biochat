TITLE
Comparison of hepatic gene change after partial hepatectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Partial hepatectomy, resection of a portion of liver mass, indues significant liver regenerative responses that consist of numerous genetic changes. To identify specific genetic changes, we compare the liver of mice underwent either hepatectomy or sham operation.

DESIGN
The experiment compared 2 sets of biological duplicates which included hepatectomized liver and sham-operated liver
