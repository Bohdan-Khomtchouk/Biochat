TITLE
Thermotoga species transcription on glucose and a mix of polysaccharides

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima ; Thermotoga neapolitana ; Thermotoga petrophila ; Thermotoga sp. RQ2

SUMMARY
Hyperthermophilic bacteria of the genus Thermotoga are known to utilize a wide range of simple and complex polysaccharides. T. maritima's transcriptional response to a variety of mono- and poly-saccharides was previously studied to assign functions to genes involved in carbohydrate uptake and utilization. To compare and contrast closely-related members of the Thermotoga genus, a four-species microarray was developed by expanding a whole genome T. maritima array to include unique genes from three other species (T. neapolitana, T. petrophila, and T. sp. RQ2). This multi-species array was used to investigate the diversity of the genus, specifically the response of each of the four species to a mixture of polysaccharides (galactomannan, glucomannan, xylan, pectin, lichenan, and carboxymethyl cellulose).

DESIGN
RNA derived from glucose-grown cultures (glu) was compared to RNA derived from polysaccharide-grown cultures (poly) using a dye swap setup.
