TITLE
Gene expression profiles of adult renal corpusle isolated using sieving techniques. (GUDMAP Series ID: 30)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney. The central thesis is straightforward. The use of microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

DESIGN
CD-1 mice were utilized to isolate the renal corpusle from the kidneys of  adult mice. The  renal corpusle were isolated from the kidney using a sieving procedure.   RNA was isolated and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays.
