TITLE
Colour analysis in Fenneropenaeus merguiensis

ORGANISM
Fenneropenaeus merguiensis

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression analysis of three F. merguiensis colour groups (dark, light, albino), using custom microarrays.

DESIGN
A total of 12 light, 12 dark and 9 albino prawn samples were analysed, using total RNA extracted from cuticle tissue. 3 biological replicates were pooled onto each of the 4 arrays for the light and dark samples; and for the albino samples, groups of 2, 2, 2 and 3 biological replicates were pooled for the 4 arrays. Single colour analysis was carried out, using the Cy3 dye.
