TITLE
RNA Sequencing Reveals the Snail-Regulated Transcriptome in Head-and-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical biological process in normal development and tumor progression. One of the EMT regulator, Snail is shown to suppress or activate its downstream genes to sustain migratory capacities while remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Identification of the Snail-regulated transcriptome through a robust sequencing technique will give a global direction for targeting Snail-driven malignancy.

DESIGN
The stable Snail-expressing and vector control HNSCC cells are generated by lentivirus transduction. The differential expression profiles of cell established are assessed to identify the enriched biological functions and hub genes.
