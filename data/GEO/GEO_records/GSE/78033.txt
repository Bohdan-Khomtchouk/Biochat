TITLE
Expression Data from Uveal Melanoma patient-derived xenograft and tumor of origin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compare the genetic profiles of the primary tumors of uveal melanoma or metastasis to their corresponding xenografts that have been passaged over time. The study included patient tumors and corresponding xenografts at very early (P1), early (P4), and late (P9) in vivo passages

DESIGN
The transcriptome of 16 uveal melanoma patient-derived xenografts models were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array
