TITLE
Expression profiling analyses of ECF sigma factor PG1660 mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis W83

SUMMARY
To study the expression profile of ECF sigma factor PG1660 mutant under anaerobic conditions and hydrogen peroxide stress conditions compared to the wild-type W83 by using DNA-microarray. The role of ECF sigma factor PG1660 involved in oxidative stress was published Yuetan Dou, Devon Osbourne, Rachelle McKenzie, Hansel M Fletcher. (2010) Involvement of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors in virulence regulation in Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. FEMS Microbiology Letter, 312(1):24-32.

DESIGN
6 array sets were used for W83 under anaerobic conditions; 3 were used for PG1660 mutant under anaerobic conditions; 3 were used for W83 under hydrogen peroxide stress conditions; 3 were used for PG1660 mutant under hydrigen peroxide stress conditions; 3 were used for ECF sigma factors PG0162PG1660 mutant under anaerobic conditions

PLATFORM
GPL6533 Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 array
