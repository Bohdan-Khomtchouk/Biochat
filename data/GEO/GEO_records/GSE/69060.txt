TITLE
Gene expression profiles from human splenic macrophages, sinusoid lining cells and HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared to typical endothelial cells (HUVEC) and splenic macrophages (CD14+CD45+), SLCs have phenotype closer to splenic macrophages.

DESIGN
Unstimulated splenic macrophages and SLCs were FACSorted from the collagenase digested spleen of 4 adult healthy subjects, and 4 HUVEC samples were collected and digested for RNA isolation and Agilent analysis.
