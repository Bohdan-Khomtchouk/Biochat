TITLE
The Cytokines Interleukin-1 and Interferon-gamma Differentially Program Beta-glucanâ€“activated Dendritic Cells via IkappaB-zeta Modulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the DC genome-wide gene expression in response to beta-glucan and its regulation by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) we used a whole genome microarray. The gene expression profiling was performed in DC left untreated or exposed to beta-glucan for 4 and 12 h, in absence or presence of IL-1RA. This strategy allowed the identification of early/immediate and late/secondary genes regulated by beta-glucan in an IL-1-dependent and -independent manner. Human monocyte-derived DC were obtained by a 6/7-d cultures of freshly isolated monocytes with recombinant human IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (50 ng/ml).

DESIGN
Beta-glucan-associated gene expression and its regulation by IL-1RA in human DC was measured in cells left untreated or at 4 and 12 h after exposure to 10 ug/ml of particulate beta-glucan in absence or presence of 2.5 ug/ml of IL-1RA. Five different conditions (Untreated 0h, beta-glucan 4h, IL-1RA + beta-glucan 4h, beta-glucan 12h, and IL-1RA + beta-glucan 12h) were tested using DC from three different donors.
