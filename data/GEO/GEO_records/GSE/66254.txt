TITLE
Frequent derepression of the mesenchymal transcription factor gene in acute myeloid leukemia (human)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow samples from normal adult male donors were collected into EDTA. Red cells were removed by ammonium chloride lysis. Leukocytes were washed in SM buffer and CD34+ cells were separated from CD34- cells using an AutoMACS device and anti-CD34 immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec), according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. For mature cell populations, CD34- cells were FACS purified according to the following immunophenotypes, with 7-AAD used to exclude dead cells: Neutrophils: side scatter high CD15+ CD16+. Monocytes: side scatter low-intermediate CD14+ CD16- CD15-. See also Huang et al., 2014.

DESIGN
Eight exon arrays total; 4 arrays for each cell type; four separate individuals.

PLATFORM
