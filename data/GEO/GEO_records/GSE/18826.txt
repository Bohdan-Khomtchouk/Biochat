SUMMARY
Full title: Three-dimensional culture of AIDS-NHL cells influences gene expression related to B-cell development, proliferation and survival The AIDS-NHL-derived cell line, UMCL01-101, representing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of immunoblastic morphology (AIDS-IBL), was grown in conventional, static suspension culture or three-dimensionally (3D) in the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor.  The objective was to assess the impact on gene expression of growth as a three-dimensional tissue assembly. Global gene expression analysis was performed on UMCL01-101 cells grown under either condition using Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
UMCL01-101 cells were cultured in the Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor to form 3D assemblies, or in conventional suspension culture, for 15 days.  RNA was prepared from triplicate samples under each growth condition and submitted for microarray analysis.
