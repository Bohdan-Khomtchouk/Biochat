TITLE
Root transcriptome of the facultative parasitic plant Phtheirospermum japonicum

ORGANISM
Phtheirospermum japonicum

SUMMARY
47,984 unigenes with putative coding regions with at least 50 amino acids were selected  from whole transcriptome (SAMN03271814) of Phtheirospermum japonicum Microarray slides were hybridized with labeled cRNA from roots of 2-week-old Phtheirospermum japonicum plants growing axenically and treated with haustoria-inducer DMBQ (10 ÂµM) for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h

DESIGN
In this study the expression data from three biological replicates of each time-point are presented. In addition, one single biological replication of a mock-treated sample for each time-point. As a control of the background and uneven hybridization, ten probes for randomly selected fifty unrelated sequences were designed and fixed in different locations of the array
