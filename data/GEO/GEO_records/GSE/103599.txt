ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: To analysis lncRNAs expression profiles and identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells response to T. pallidum infection in neurosyphilis patients. Methods: CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RNA extraction was performed to conduct further experiments. Expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells isolated from neurosyphilis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by using microarray assay. Four lncRNAs were selected to conduct validation by using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the expression levels of those above mentioned lncRNAs in neurosyphilis patients and healthy controls were compared. Results: In total, 17, 278 lncRNAs and 15, 840 mRNA were found to be differentially expressed when comparing the CD4+ T cells between neurosyphilis patients and healthy control individuals. Of these transcripts, 2258 lncRNAs and 1728 mRNAs were significantly over or under expressed, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, AC068282.3 (fold change: 21.90) and CTD-3064M3.3 (fold change: 23.93) were the most over-expressed and under-expressed lncRNAs in neurosyphilis patients. The majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs are from intergenic regions (~ 57.5%), intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (~ 15.0%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (~12.1%). It is worth noting that 59 lncRNAs were significant difference along with significantly different mRNA. Among the 59 pairs of genes, LOC7999 mRNA was positively correlated with lncRNA RP11-160E2.16, RP11-160E2.11, RP11-160E2.19, respectively; NKX1-1 mRNA was positively correlated with lncRNA RP11-1398P2.1, RP11-160E2.19, XLOC_003422, respectively. The following five mRNAs were correlated with two differential lncRNAs, namely DUSP16, AP000349.1, FAM115C, TIMM8A, SMCHD1. GO analysis revealed that the differentially expressed coding genes were mainly involved in the biological processes, and among them, the most significant association was observed in defense response to fungus, defense response to bacterium, killing cells of other organism and disruption of cells of other organism. Subsequent pathway analysis was also conducted, and T cell receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, etc. were found out to be associated with differentially expressed mRNAs. Conclusion: The present study revealed the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in CD4+ T cells response to T. pallidum infection in neurosyphilis patients. LncRNAs are involved in the key biological process in CD4+ T cell response to T. pallidum infection.
