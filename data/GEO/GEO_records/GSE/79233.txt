TITLE
Gene expression in primary chondrocytes derived from Rela-cKO/control mice with/without TNF-α treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify target genes mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of Rela, we isolated primary chondrocytes from Prrx1-Cre;Relafl/fl and Relafl/fl mice, cultured them with or without 10 ng/mL TNF-α, and compared gene expression profiles by microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Primary chondrocytes from Prrx1-Cre;Relafl/fl and Relafl/fl mice were treated with or without 10 ng/mL TNF-α.
