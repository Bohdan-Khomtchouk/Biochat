TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from pigs exposed to a high-fat diet (H-F) or to a high-fat diet plus resveratrol (H-F+RES)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in PBMNCs isolated from female and male pigs to determine significant modulatory effects that may have been induced by the intake of resveratrol during 9 months in high-fat fed animals .

DESIGN
The aim of this work was to determine whether the intake of dietary levels of resveratrol (RES) exerted any modulatory effects, at the level of gene expression, in PBMNCs isolated from female and male pigs exposed to a H-F diet for 9 months. We first isolated PBMNCs, and the corresponding total RNA, from 5 female pigs and 5 male pigs at time 0 (beginning of the experiment) to determine basal gene expression levels and to compare sex differential gene expression. Animals designated to the control group were then fed a normal chow (5% beef tallow) for 9 months. Animals in the H-F diet were fed a chow with 20% of beef tallow and animals in the H-F diet supplemented with resveratrol were fed the 20% fat diet plus resveratrol (8 mg/Kg body weight per day). From each group, PBMNCs were isolated from 2 female and 2 male animals. Pure RNA was extracted from the PBMNCs for microarrays analyses (Affymetrix) and gene differential expression determined between the H-F fed animals and CT animals (to determine the effects of fat consumption) and between the H-F fed animals supplemented with RES and the H-F group (to determine the effects of RES on the fat consumption).
