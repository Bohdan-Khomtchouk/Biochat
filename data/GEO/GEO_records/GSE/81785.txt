TITLE
Expression data regarding the effect of NPM1 knockdown on TNF-a induced gene expression in HeLa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NPM1 was reported to regulate the SOD2 gene expression through regulation of NF-kB. However, the effect of NPM1 on the NF-kB-dependent transcriptome has not been exmained. To examine the effect of NPM1 on NF-kB-dependent transcriptome. We used microarray to examine the effect of knockdown of NPM1 on the gene expression induced by TNF-a treatment which activates NF-kB pathway.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were transfected with siNPM1 or non-specific siRNA for 72 h, followed by without or with treatment of TNF-a. The cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Through comparing the samples, we aimed to identify the TNF-a induced genes that were regulated by knockdown of NPM1.
