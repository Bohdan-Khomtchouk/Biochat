TITLE
Hela cells treated with or without IFNgamma at different time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to define which genes are IFNgamma sensitive, resistant, or irrelevant in our desired 16MB Human genome. Different ISGs(Interferon sensitive genes) were categorized based on this expression array data and can be visulized in our 16MB IFNgamma genes DB. Keywords: treated/untreated different time point comparison
