TITLE
Hela cells treated with or without IFNgamma at different time points

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to define which genes are IFNgamma sensitive, resistant, or irrelevant in our desired 16MB Human genome. Different ISGs(Interferon sensitive genes) were categorized based on this expression array data and can be visulized in our 16MB IFNgamma genes DB. Keywords: treated/untreated different time point comparison

DESIGN
HeLa cells left untreated or 6, 24 and 48 hours after IFNgamma treatment were collected for RNA isolation as previously described (Pattenden et al., EMBO (2002) 21: 1978).  Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped and spun down at 1200 rpm for 5 min.  Cell pellet was suspended in Trizol (invitrogen), left for 5 minutes at room temperature and was chloroform extracted.  RNA was precipitated with isoprpanol and s8spendeed in RNAse-free water.  RNA was Dnase treated (Ambion).  Microarray whole genome analysis was performed on Illumina HumanRef-6 Expression Beadchip. Raw intensities from three independent biological replicates was processed by Illumina BeadStudio  software (Illumina, Toronto, ON). Compared to data normalized by various procedures, the data submitted (average raw value) provides the best validation by real-time PCR.
