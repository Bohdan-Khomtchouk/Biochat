TITLE
Wound-induced neoblast specialization in S. mediterranea

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
We report the expression of mRNA transcripts in X1 neoblast isolated by FACS followin amputation of the head (anterior wounding) and amputation of the pharyx and tail (posterior wounding) at 0 and 48 hours

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of pre-pharyngeal X1 cells from anterior and posterior facing wounds at 0 and 48 hrs after wounding in S. mediterranea

PLATFORM
