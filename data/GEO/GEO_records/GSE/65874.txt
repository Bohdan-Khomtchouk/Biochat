TITLE
Gene Expression in 70Z/3 pre-B cells Stably Overexpressing Individual members of the mirn23a MiRNA Cluster

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of the mirn23a cluster in murine hematopoietic progenitors blocks B cell development.  Overexpressed individual cluster members miRs-23a, 24-2, and -27a in 70/3 mouse pre-B cells in order to examine changes in gene expression that would potentially reveal targets of the miRs relevant to hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Two independent 70Z/3 cell lines for each experimental group were generated (MSCV, miR-23a, miR-24-2, and miR-27a). RNA was generated and  hybridized  on Affymetrix microarrays.
