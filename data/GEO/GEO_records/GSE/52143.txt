TITLE
Changes in global gene expression in lung cancer cell lines A549 (A) and HTB56 (H) [Affymetrix microarrays]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we analyzed global gene expression changes that were associated with pro-metastatic phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer using the Affymetrix microarray platform.

DESIGN
Changes in global gene expression were determined with Affymetrix microarrays in lung cancer cell lines A549 (A) and HTB56 (H). We generated NSCLC lines with highly increased propensity to form tumor nodules in murine lungs after intravenous injections. In addition to the normal cell lines (0R) we analyzed gene expression of the the cell lines after three rounds of in vivo selection towards a highly metastatic phenotype (3R).
