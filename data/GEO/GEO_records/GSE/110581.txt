TITLE
Zfp36l1 overexpression/knockdown effect on primary mouse articular chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary mouse articular chondrocyte infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing mouse ZFP36 Ring Finger Protein Like 1(Zfp36l1) or recombinant adenovirus expressing mouse small hairpin RNA of Zfp36l1. In this study, we have attempted to explore the effects of Zfp36l1 gene overexpression or knockdown on mouse transcriptome and have identified numerous genes which are involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary mouse articular chondrocytes were isolated from mouse femoral condyles and tibial plateaus cartilage tissue and were infected with null (control) or recombinant adenovirus expressing ZFP36 Ring Finger Protein Like 1 (Ad-Zfp36l1) or small hairpin RNA of Zfp36l1(Ad-shZfp36l1) for 36 hours. At 36 hours post-infection, total RNA was extracted from infected with null control adenovirus (3 biological replicates) or infected with recombinant Ad-Zfp36l1 (3 biological replicates) or recombinant Ad-shZfp36l1 (3 biological replicates) on primary mouse articular chondrocytes and subjected to microarray analysis.
