TITLE
Identification of glaikit in a genome-wide expression profiling for axonal bifurcation of the mushroom body in Drosophila. [Agilent-018972]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Axonal branching is a fundamental requirement for sending electrical signals to multiple targets. However, despite the importance of axonal branching in neural development and function, the molecular mechanisms that control branch formation are poorly understood. Previous studies have hardly addressed the intracellular signaling cascade of axonal bifurcation characterized by growth cone splitting. Recently we reported that DISCO interacting protein 2 (DIP2) regulates bifurcation of mushroom body axons in Drosophila melanogaster. DIP2 mutant displays ectopic bifurcations in α/β neurons. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, we tried to identify genes involved in branching formation by comparing the transcriptome of wild type with that of DIP2 RNAi flies. A microarray analysis and a subsequent qRT-PCR experiment reviled that Glaikit (Gkt), a member of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, is potentially a downstream target of DIP2. RNAi against gkt phenocopied the ectopic axonal branches observed in DIP2 mutant. Furthermore, a genetic analysis between gkt and DIP2 revealed that gkt acts in parallel with DIP2. In conclusion, we identified a novel gene underlying the axonal bifurcation process.

DESIGN
The central brain was isolated at 24 hrs APF to compare the entire gene expression profiles of elav-Gal4/ UAS-dicer2;; UAS-DIP2-RNAi (DIP2 RNAi) with those of elav-Gal4/ UAS-dicer2 (control). The experiments were performed in four biological replicates.
