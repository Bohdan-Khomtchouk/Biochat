TITLE
RNA expression for ethanologenic E coli strains LY180 and LY180 del yqhC in the absence and presence of furfural

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The data explore the transcription of strain LY180 and the yqhC deletion mutant LY180 del yqhC without and with 0.5 g/L furfural. LY180 and LY180 del yqhC are described in Turner, PC, EN Miller, LR Jarboe, P Pharkya, KT Shanmugam, and LO Ingram. 2009. Escherichia coli YqhC regulates transcription of the adjacent   yqhD and dkgA genes, and mutations in yqhC contribute to furfural resistance in ethanologenic strains (in preparation for submission to Appl Env Microbiol)

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from cultures of LY180 and LY180 del yqhC immediately before and 15 min after addition of furfural to 0.5 g/L.  The Nimblegen TI83333 chip measures expression of 4,237 genes, with 5 replicates, and 18 probes average per gene.
