TITLE
The gene expression profile of renal cell carcinoma cell line (786-O) versus prostate cancer cell line (PC3) in co-culture with primary murine muscle progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have a life expectancy of 6 months to 1 year. The deadly nature of RCC compared to other tumors that metastasize to bone, such as prostate cancer (PC), is associated with extensive arteriogenesis that requires recruitment of muscle progenitor cells to form the vascular smooth muscle around these large vessels. To identify potential genes that are involved in RCC recruitment of muscle progenitor cells we performed a microarray analysis to evaluate the global gene expression of human RCC (786-O) cells that form these large vessels in murine xenografts, versus human PC (PC3) that do not form these large vessels during osteolytic bone metastasis in mice (Xie C, et al. J Orthop Res. 2011;30(2):325-33). To assess changes in gene expression that occur when tumor cells interact with muscle progenitor cells, primary myoblast isolated from 5-day-old C57BL/6-Tg GFP neonatal mouse limbs were co-cultured with RCC or PC cells.

DESIGN
The experiment contained five groups: [Group 1] pure 786-O cells; [Group 2] pure PC3 cells; [Group 3] 1:1 co-culture of myoblast with 786-O cells; [Group 4] 1:1 co-culture of myoblasts with PC. All cultures were plated at 80% confluence, and the cells were harvested 12 hours later to isolate total RNA.
