TITLE
IM004 - mouse infection with HA avirulent mutation in A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG1/2004(H5N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determination of the host response (C57Bl6 mouse model) to the HA avirulent mutation in A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG1/2004(H5N1) virus at 10^4PFU.

DESIGN
Groups of 20 week old C57BL6 mice were infected with the HA avirulent mutation in A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG1/2004(H5N1) virus at 10^4PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i.  There were 3-4 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
