TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the livers from mice that had been fed water-soluble extract of Pacific Krill

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: We previously reported that intake of a water-soluble extract of Pacific Krill (WEPAK) by mice decreases triglyceride accumulation in liver and suppresses weight gain induced by a high-fat diet.  However, the mechanisms mediating these phenomena were not investigated or revealed in our previous study. Methods and Findings: Here, we investigated the effect of WEPAK in mouse liver using transcriptome analysis and discovered that WEPAK induced the expression of genes categorized into the gene ontology (GO) term lipid metabolic process.  Furthermore, two regulators of fatty acid β-oxidation, AMPK and PPARδ, were induced in the liver and muscle of mice that had taken in WEPAK. Conclusions: These results indicate that WEPAK increased the expression of genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation via activation of AMPK and PPARδ.  WEPAK may have the effect of improving lipid metabolism and, therefore, may be beneficial in the prevention of obesity.
