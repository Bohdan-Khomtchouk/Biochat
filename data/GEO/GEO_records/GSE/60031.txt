TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of embryonic stem cell derived gastrointestinal tissue.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Successful differentiation methods have been developed in several endodermal organs, including liver, pancreas, and intestine from embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cells. Compare to these organs, however, little has been known in gastric differentiation from embryonic stem cells. Here, we established a method of  gastrointestinal tissue differentiation methods, including stomach regions from embryonic stem cells. These gastrointestinal tissue built gut primordium-like spheroids, which is also able to mature into adult tissue containing all differentiated cells in three-dimensional culture. These embryonic stem cells derived gastrointestinal tissue possessed the similar gene expression profile that of adult stomach. These data indicated that functional gastrointestinal tissue can be derived from embryonic stem cells by mimicking in vivo development and could be useful for investigating gastrointestinal study such as disease modeling.

DESIGN
We generated arrays from embryonic stem cells-derived stomach tissue cells cultured in FGF10, WNT3A, NOGGIN and R-SPONDIN1 for 42 days, 46 days, and 5 months, or SHH and BMP4 for 4 days after cultured in FGF10, WNT3A, NOGGIN, and R-SPONDIN1 for 42 days. In addition, we also generated arrays from adult mouse stomach, esophagus, lung, intestine, and embryonic stomach as controls. All the datas were normalized to 75% tile shift.
