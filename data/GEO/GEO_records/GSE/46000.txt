TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of 2D colonies derived from WT, Bmi1-/-, and Bmi1-/-;Ink4a/Arf Labial cervical loops

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment is aimed at determining the genetic signature of dental stem cell colonies grown in vitro and how that signature changes when Bmi1 activity is removed. Another question to be answered by the experiment is whether Bmi1 has alternate targets besides Ink4a/Arf.

DESIGN
There are 12 total samples: 4 biological replicates for each genotype that consist of single colonies grown in vitro.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
