TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determing the influence of lipid metabolism on murine T cell blastogenesis. Gene expression studies from purified  spleen and lymph node T cells with conditional deletion of the SREBP Cleavage Activating Protein (SCAP) ex vivo or activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies for 6 h.

DESIGN
CD8 T cells were purified from T cell specific Scap deficient mouse spleens (KO, n=3) and control littermate (WT, n=3). The cells from each mouse were used for RNA extraction at either quiescent (T0) or 6 h activation (T6).
