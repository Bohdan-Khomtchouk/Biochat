TITLE
Tet-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation regulates retinal neurogenesis in zebrafish via cell-extrinsic signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using zebrafish tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutants, we identify functions for Tet enzymes and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in regulating gene expression and cell type-specific differentiation during retinal development.

DESIGN
RNAseq from tet2-/-;tet3-/- mutant and sibling embryonic eye tissues dissected at 72hpf and 36hpf.

PLATFORM
GPL18413 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Danio rerio) GPL20828 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Danio rerio)
