TITLE
Gene Density, Transcription and Insulators Contribute to the Partition of the Drosophila Genome into Physical Domains (Hi-C analysis of Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 genome)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The mechanisms responsible for the establishment of physical domains in metazoan chromosomes are poorly understood. Here we find that physical domains in Drosophila chromosomes are demarcated at regions of active transcription and high gene density that are enriched for transcription factors and specific combinations of insulator proteins. Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior. Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic marks.

DESIGN
We carried out Hi-C experiment using HindIII on Kc167 cells and generate two libraries separately. One library was sequenced once more as technical replicates (TR1 and TR2), the other library was sequenced as biological replicate (BR). processed files contain the following: Column 1:  chromosome ID in which the first read in a pair locates Column 2:  coordinate of the first read Column 3:  chromosome ID in which the second read in a pair locates Column 4:  coordinate of the second read
