TITLE
DNA methylation data from mouse hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation was studied to determine the methylome map of lymphoid and myeoloid commitment from hematopoietic progenitors We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation in FACs purified mouse hematopoietic progeniors

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from mouse MPPFL-, MPPFL+, CLP, DN1, DN2, DN3, CMP and GMP cells and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays).
