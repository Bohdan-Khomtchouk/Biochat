TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Bruguiera gymnorhiza under salt stress

ORGANISM
Bruguiera gymnorhiza

SUMMARY
To identify key genes in the regulation of salt tolerance in the mangrove plant Bruguiera gymnorhiza, the transcriptome profiling under salt stress was carried out. Main roots and lateral roots were collected from the mangrove plants at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, 3 6 and 12 days after NaCl-treatment. Keywords: time course, stress response, root type comparison

DESIGN
Samples were collected from each set of three trees at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, 3 6 and 12 days after NaCl-treatment, that is 27 trees were used in total. RNA was extracted from mixture of the samples from 3 trees to average genotypes of 3 trees.

PLATFORM
