TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of transformed MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transformed MSCs at gene expression level. The aim in the present study was that overexpression of MYC in the MSCs alter gene expression of MSCs. Results provide important information of the response of overexpresion of MYCs, such as up- or down-regulated specific anabolic/catabolic cellular functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from transformed MSCs or MSC culture cells at different passages.
