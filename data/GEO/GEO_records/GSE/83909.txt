TITLE
Gene expression changes in Cenococcum geophilum-Pinus sylvestris  ectomycorrhizal roots compared to Cenococcum geophilum free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Cenococcum geophilum

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizal roots compared to free-living mycelium . Mycorrhizal roots were harvested after 3 months, pooled and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Cenococcum geophilum ( ) reference transcripts using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizal roots and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
