TITLE
Changes in expression of small non-coding RNAs/microRNAs during aging in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We report a significant number of miRNAs and other non-coding small RNAs show dramatic changes in expression during aging in C. elegans. RNAs were prepared from four diffrent timepoints during adulthood of C. elegans hermaphrodites, Day 0, 5, 8 and 12 post-L4 molt, and used for making cDNA libraries for small RNAs. Each library was sequenced using recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, Solexa. This study should lead to a better understanding of the aging process and age-related diseases.
