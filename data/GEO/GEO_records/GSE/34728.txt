TITLE
The tudor domain protein Kumo is required to assemble the nuage and to generate germline piRNAs in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We are submitting two small RNA libraries derived from ovarian tissue of mutant and heterozygous for the Kumo/Qin gene, required for the piRNA production in germline cells. In absence of Kumo/Qin, piRNA production is reduced and transposons are derepressed.

DESIGN
Analysis of piRNA production in Kumo/Qin mutants

PLATFORM
GPL11203 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Drosophila melanogaster)
