TITLE
RNA-seq analysis for mRNA expression change in alpha-synclein fibril-treated cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Glial cytoplasmic inclusion is the pathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy commonly observed as alpha-synulcien-positive aggregates within oligodendrocytes. We elucidated that preformed alpha-synulcien fibrils triggers multimerization and upsurge of endogenous alpha-synulcien in oligodendrocyte precursor cells which is attributable to insufficient autophagic proteolysis. To assess the functional influence of alpha-synuclein fibrils application on oligodendrocyte precursor cells, RNA-seq analysis was performed. The data revealed  that alpha-synulcien fibrils interfered with numerous protein expressions associated with neuronal support and myelination.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of primary cultured rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells incubated with or without alpha-synuclein fibril for 72 hours were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina MiSeq.
