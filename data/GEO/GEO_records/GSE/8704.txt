TITLE
Gene expression in Wip1+/+ or -/- MEFs after gamma radiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assessment of p53 targets by gene expression array analysis in irradiated and nonirradiated Wip1+/+ and Wip1-/- MEFs. Keywords: response to gamma radiation

DESIGN
mRNA from each set of cells harvested four hours after IR (5 Gy) was used for gene expression microarray analysis of p53 target genes using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Chips.
