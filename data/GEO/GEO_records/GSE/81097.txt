TITLE
RNA-seq Based Transcriptomic Map Reveals New Insights Into Mouse Salivary Gland Development and Maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes during mouse salivary gland development using RNA-Seq

DESIGN
RNA was collected and analyzed for at least two biological replicates each from six developmental timepoints (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, P5, 4 weeks, 12 weeks)
