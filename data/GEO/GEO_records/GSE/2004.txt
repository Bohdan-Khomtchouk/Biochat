SUMMARY
Normal kidney, liver, spleen, and Universal RNA from Stratagene were expression profiled across five centers (UCLA, Duke, TGen, Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, and University of Pennsylvania) using the Affymetrix, spotted Operon, Agilent, and Amersham arrays to identify differences in expression between microarray platforms as well as centers. To compare the four microarray platforms as well as the reproducibility across the centers. There will be expression differences between the five centers. The following array types were profiled at the centers: UCLA: Affymetrix, Amersham, Agilent TGen: Affymetrix (3000 scanner) Children's: Affymetrix (2500 scanner) Duke: Operon Oligo University of Penn.: Affymetrix Series_author: Consortium,,Cross Platform Keywords: other
