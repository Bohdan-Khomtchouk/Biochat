TITLE
Single cell methylome landscapes of mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos analyzed by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Escherichia virus Lambda

SUMMARY
We develop a single cell methylome analysis technique based on RRBS, which works robustly for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), sperm, metaphase II oocytes, and zygotes.

DESIGN
In total, 36 samples were analyzed, including 8 single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), pooled-5, 10, 20 mESCs, bulk mESCs, 7 single sperms, 10 single pronuclei from 5 individual zygotes, 2 metaphase II oocytes, 2 the first polar bodies and 3 negative controls.

PLATFORM
