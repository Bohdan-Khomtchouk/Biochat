TITLE
The photoreceptor chaperone FHY1 has an independent role in gene modulation and plant development under far-red light [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To incorporate the far-red light (FR) signal into a strategy for optimizing plant growth, FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1 (FHY1) mediates the nuclear translocation of the FR photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) and facilitates the association of phyA with the promoters of numerous associated genes crucial for the response to environmental stimuli. However, whether FHY1 plays additional roles following FR irradiation remains elusive. Here, by the global identification of FHY1 chromatin association sites through ChIP-seq analysis and by the comparison of FHY1-associated sites with phyA- associated sites, we demonstrated that nuclear FHY1 can either act independently of phyA or act in association with phyA to activate the expression of distinct  target genes. We also determined that phyA can act independently of FHY1 in regulating phyA-specific target genes. Furthermore, we determined that the independent FHY1 nuclear pathway is involved in crucial developmental aspects, as in the case of inhibited seed germination under FR during salt-stress. Notably, the differential presence of cis-elements and transcription factors in common and unique FHY1 and/or phyA associated genes are indicative of the complexity of the independent and coordinated FHY1 and phyA pathways. Our study uncovers new aspects of FHY1 function beyond its currently recognized role in phyA-dependent photomorphogenesis

DESIGN
The 35S: GFP-FHY1 fhy1-1 transgenic line and the fhy1-1 mutant were grown under the same light conditions used  (D4d+FR3h) for RNA preparation and sequencing. Three biologically replicates were subjected to high-throughput Solexa (Illumina) sequencing.

PLATFORM
