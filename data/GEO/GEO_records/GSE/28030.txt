TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia_diagnostic sample_patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-resolution genomic microarrays provides simultaneous detection of copy-number aberrations such as the known recurrent aberrations in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia_diagnostic sample_patient (del(11q), del(13q), del(17p) and trisomy 12),  and copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity. We screened 369 newly diagnosed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia_diagnostic sample_patient patient samples from a population-based cohort using 250K single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples.
