TITLE
H3K4me2 profiling in C3H-10T1/2 preadipocytes [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By screening a collection of epigenetic compounds, we find that Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors repress brown adipocyte differentiation. RNAi-mediated Lsd1 knockdown shows similar effect, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, LSD1. Furthermore, adenoviral Cre-mediated Lsd1 deletion in mice leads to inhibition of brown adipogenesis, validating the pivotal role of LSD1 in brown fat development in vivo. LSD1 represses gene expression by demethylating H3K4. To identify the target genes of LSD1 during BAT differentiation, we analyzed the H3K4me2 enrichment in preadipocyte.

DESIGN
Using ChIP-seq, we examined the H3K4me2 genomic enrichment locations in C3H-10T1/2 preadipocytes.
