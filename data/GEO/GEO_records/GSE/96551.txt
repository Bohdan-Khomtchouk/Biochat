TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the differentially expressed genes between a butanol-producing wild type strain and a pykA mutant during fermentation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To analyze the change of transcription pattern and differentially expressed genes caused by pykA inactivation as the pykA mutant showed a longer growth cycle, increased butanol titer and less pyruvate accumulation. Some new target genes may be used for further metabolic engineering.

DESIGN
The total RNA of strain EB216 and EB216-∆pykA (EB222) was isolated in different time points in the fermentation process at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. Samples of strain EB216 were used as control samples for strain EB216-∆pykA at the respective time. Illumina Hiseq2000 platform was employed for RNA-Seq.
