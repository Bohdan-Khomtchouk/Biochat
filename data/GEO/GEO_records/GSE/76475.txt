TITLE
Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 iCLIP from mouse brain nuclear fractions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we analyze the in vivo recruitment of mouse brain nuclear Rbfox proteins to RNA using individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). Rbfox1, Rbfox, 2, and Rbfox3 iCLIP libraries were constructed from high molecular weight (HMW) nuclear fraction containing chromatin and the soluble nucleoplasm.

DESIGN
This study includes six iCLIP libraries prepared from HMW nuclear fraction: Rbfox1_HMW_forebrain, Rbfox1_HMW_hindbrain, Rbfox2_HMW_forebrain, Rbfox2_HMW_hindbrain, Rbfox3_HMW_forebrain, and Rbfox3_HMW_hindbrain. Two libraries from the soluble nucleoplasm were prepared from the same biological sample: Rbfox1_soluble_forebrain and Rbfox1_soluble_hindbrain. Additionally, three other nucleoplasmic samples were prepared independently: Rbfox1_soluble_brain, Rbfox2_soluble_brain, and Rbfox3_soluble_brain.
