TITLE
Changes in the expression of miR-381 and miR-495 are inversely associated with the expression of the MDR1 gene and development of multi-drug resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multidrug resistance (MDR) frequently develops in cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutic agents and is usually brought about by over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which acts as a drug efflux pump. MiRNAome profiling using next-generation sequencing identified differentially expressed microRNAs (miRs) between parental K562 cells and MDR K562 cells (K562/ADM) induced by chronic adriamycin treatment.

DESIGN
MiRNAome profiling in untreated K562 cells and K562 cells exposed to long-term adriamycin treatment

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
