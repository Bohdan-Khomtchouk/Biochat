TITLE
H3K27ac profiling in control and DSS-treated colonic epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined changes in enhancer chromatin that occur during colonic inflammation, found that dynamic chromatin regions are enriched for HNF4A binding motirfs, and then measured HNF4A binidng by ChIP-seq in each condition.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27ac histone modification in normal and DSS-treated colon, examination of HNF4A binding by ChIP-seq in normal and DSS-treated colon epithelium

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
