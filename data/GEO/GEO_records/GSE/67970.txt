TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of FSH response in bovine cumulus cells

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Study the effect of recombinant human FSH supplementation in the in vitro maturation medium for an incubation of 6 hrs on the transcriptomics of bovine cumulus cells.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of cumulus cells derived from cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) supplemented with FSH (CC-FSH) vs. cumulus cells without FSH (Ct-6H, REFERENCE) were contrasted. Each replicate was subjected to a dye-swap procedure.
