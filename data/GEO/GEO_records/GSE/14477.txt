TITLE
mRNA profiling of mir-155-overexpressing fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify putative fibroblasts-specific targets of mir-155, we overexpressed mir-155 in lung fibroblasts by transfecting them with a synthetic pre-mir-155 or a synthetic “negative” pre-miRNA as control (miR-Neg). RNA samples were harvested at 24 and 48 hours post-transfection and 2 independent experiments were carried out.

DESIGN
24 and 48 hours post-transfection, 2 independent experiments performed in dye-swap: miR-155 versus miR-Neg
