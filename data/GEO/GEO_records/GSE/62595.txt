TITLE
Comparison of L-carnitine treated day 6 in vivo bovine embryos to controls, in both the Jersey and Holstein breeds.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The decreased rate of pregnancy obtained in cattle using frozen in vitro embryos compared to in vivo embryos has been associated with over-accumulation of intracellular lipid, which causes cell damage during cryopreservation. It is believed that the higher lipid content of blastomeres of bovine embryos produced in vitro results in darker coloured cytoplasm which could be a consequence of impaired mitochondrial function. In this study, L-carnitine was used as a treatment to reduce embryonic lipid content by increasing metabolism in cultured bovine embryos. We have observed previously that in vivo embryos of different dairy breed collected from cows housed and fed under the same conditions differed in lipid content and metabolism. As such, breed effects between Holstein and Jersey were also accounted for general appearance, lipid composition, mitochondrial activity and gene expression. Adding L-carnitine to the embryo culture medium reduced the lipid content in both breeds due to increased mitochondrial activity.

DESIGN
L-carnitine vs controls, in 4 replicates for each breed, with dye-swaps.
