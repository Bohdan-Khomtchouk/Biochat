TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of leaf at nighttime throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed during nighttime at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting to understand the changes of transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire growth of the rice plant under natural field conditions.
