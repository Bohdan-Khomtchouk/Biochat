TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of leaf at nighttime throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed during nighttime at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting to understand the changes of transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire growth of the rice plant under natural field conditions.

DESIGN
The uppermost fully-expanded leaf in the main stem corresponding to the 1st leaf until 83 days after transplanting (DAT) and the flag leaf from them on were sampled in two replicates at 12:00 midnight at 7- day intervals encompassing 17 different growth stages. All samples were obtained from rice plants grown in the field during the 2008 cultivation season.
