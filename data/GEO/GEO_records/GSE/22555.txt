TITLE
Expression data of MMTV-PyMT mice mammary tumor with or without JAM-A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Junction Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) is present on leukocytes and platelets where it promotes cell adhesion and motility. We are interested in an interaction between JAM-A and tumor progression/metastases. To address this point, we mated JAM-A-/- mice and mouse mammary tumor model MMTV-PyMT mice which, which express polyoma middle T antigen under the control of mouse mammary tumor virus. MMTV-PyMT mice show 100% penetration of mammary tumor and highly metastases to lung. MMTV-PyMT mice without JAM-A show less primary tumor progression, therefore JAM-A enhance primary tumor progression. Then we are addressing the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon by in vivo. Furthermore, we would like to examine JAM-A deficient MMTV tumor signature.

DESIGN
Each 3 MMTV-PyMT JAm-A+/+ (JamA+) and 3 MMTV JAM-A-/- (JamA-) mammary tumor were resected at early stages of tumor development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
