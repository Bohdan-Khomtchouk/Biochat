TITLE
Transgenic overexpression of Pla2g2f at a level relevant to skin pathology display alopecia and psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pla2g2f is dominantly expressed in the suprabasal layer of mouse epidermis. Microarray gene profiling supported the overall tendency of epidermal and sebaceous gland hyperplasia as well as alopecia in Pla2g2f-transgenic skin.

DESIGN
Pla2g2f-Tg/+ mice and littermate controls (C57BL/6 background); 25-day old; skin; pooled from 4 mice for each genotype.
