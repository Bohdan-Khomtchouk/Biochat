TITLE
Identification of Murine Uterine Genes Regulated in a Ligand-Dependent Manner by the Progesterone Receptor.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progesterone (P4) acting through its cognate receptor, the progesterone receptor (PR), plays an important role in uterine physiology. The PR knockout (PRKO) mouse has demonstrated the importance of the P4-PR axis in the regulation of uterine function. To define the molecular pathways regulated by P4-PR in the mouse uterus, Affymetrix MG U74Av2 oligonucleotide arrays were used to identify alterations in gene expression after acute and chronic P4 treatments. In the analysis, retinoic acid metabolic genes, cytochrome P 450 26a1 (Cyp26a1), alcohol dehydrogenase 5, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1); kallikrein genes, Klk5 and Klk6; and specific transcription factors, GATA-2 and Cited2 [cAMP-corticosterone-binding protein/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)-rich tail], were validated as regulated by the P4-PR axis. Identification and analysis of these responsive genes will help define the role of PR in regulating uterine biology.

DESIGN
Ovariectomized wild-type and progesterone receptor knockout mice were injected with either vehicle or 1 mg/mouse progesterone. The injections were repeated every 12 h, and groups of mice were killed 4 h after the first injection (acute P4 treatment) or 4 h after the fourth injection (chronic P4 treatment).
