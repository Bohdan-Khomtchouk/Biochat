TITLE
Circadian Rhythm of Gene Expression Patterns in Liver of Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genes encoding the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals have recently been identified, but the molecubasis of circadian timing in peripheral tissue is not well understood. We used a bead-based microarray to identify mouse liver transcripts that show circadian cycles of abundance under constant conditions. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
microarray-based expression profiling of mRNA with triplicates in mouse liver for 48 hours at 4-hour intervals
