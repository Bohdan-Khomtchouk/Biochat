TITLE
Identification of conserved and novel microRNAs in blueberry

ORGANISM
Vaccinium ashei

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed the high-throughput sequencing technology to profile miRNAs in blueberry fruits. A total of 9,992,446 small RNA tags with sizes ranged from 18 to 30 nt were obtained, indicating that blueberry fruits have a large and diverse small RNA population. Bioinformatic analysis has identified 412 conserved miRNAs, which belong to 20 families, and 57 predicted novel miRNAs likely unique to blueberries. Among them, expression profiles of 5 conserved miRNAs were validated by stem loop qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the potential target genes of the abundant conserved and novel miRNAs were predicted and subjected for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Enrichment analysis of the GO-represented biological processes and molecular functions revealed that these target genes were involved in a wide range of metabolic and developmental processes. This study is the first report on genome-wide miRNA profile analysis in blueberry and it provides a useful resource for further elucidation of the functional roles of miRNAs during fruit development and ripening.
