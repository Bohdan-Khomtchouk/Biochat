TITLE
Cold stress in 7 Solanaceae species, replicate 1 and 2

ORGANISM
Capsicum annuum ; Solanum lycopersicum ; Nicotiana tabacum ; Nicotiana benthamiana ; Petunia x hybrida ; Solanum melongena ; Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Seven different Solanaceae species, Potato (Solanum tubersosum), Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum), Eggplant (Solanum melangena), Pepper (Capsicum annuum), Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Petunia and Nicotiana benthamiana were subjected to cold stress. Plants were grown at 25 C for 4-6 weeks after wich cold stress was initiated by exposing the plants to 4 C for 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Control samples were isolated from  plants just before the cold stress was initated.  RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy. Keywords: Direct comparison
