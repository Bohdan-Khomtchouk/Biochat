TITLE
Repression of stress-induced LINE-1 expression protects cancer cell populations from lethal drug-exposures [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Merkel cell carcinoma is a skin cancer associated with the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)  which is found integrated in the genome of the tumor cells. Here 4 MCPyV-positive tumor cell lines (AlDo, LoKe, BroLi and WoWe) were analyzed by comparative gernomic hybridization to define further genetic alterations. Corresponding peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in case of AlDo and LoKe, purified T cells in case of BroLi and Tumor-derived but virus-negative cells of unknown origin (WoWe1)  in case of WoWe served as controls.

DESIGN
Comparative genomic hybridization to define amplifications and deletions in the MCC genome.
