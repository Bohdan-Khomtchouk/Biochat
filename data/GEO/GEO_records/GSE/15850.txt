TITLE
Expression profiling of over-expression of conspecific and heterspecific miR-310 cluster in Drosophila (tiling array)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The miRNA 310-311-312-313 cluster from D. melanogaster (referred to as Dm310s) and the homolog from D. pseudoobscura (Dp310s) were used to transform D. melanogaster. The over-expression of UAS-miR310s in two Dm310s transgenic lines (M1-7 and M1-3) and Dp310s transgenic line P4-18 was driven by GAL4 line NP5941 with native miR-310 expression pattern. We used Drosophila Tiling 1.0 F arrays to assess the effects of miR310s over-expression on the whole transcriptome.

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptional profiling of Dm310s and Dp310s overexpression in D.melanogaster using double-stranded cDNA followed by bioprime random labeling, and hybridization to Affy Drosophila tiling 1.0 F array. Third-instar progeny larvae from the crosses with maternal NP5941 and paternal UAS-miR-310 cluster transgenic lines were collected and third-instar larvae from the cross with maternal NP5941 and paternal w1118 were used as control. Three biological repeats were used for each stock. A processed data matrix reporting values (log2 intensity after quantile normalization) for all of the Samples is linked below as a supplementary file.
