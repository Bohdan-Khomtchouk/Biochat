TITLE
Divergent mechanisms of EZH1 regulation of heart development and regeneration [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq for DKO, E1KO, E2KO and WT E12.5 heart revealed that EZH1 and EZH2 play a partially redundant role to trimethylate histone H3 at Lys 27 (H3K27me3). Through EZH1, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq for P13 EZH1 and GFP overexpressing heart (AAVEzh1 and AAVGFP respectively) suffered MI at P10, we surprisingly found that EZH1 can active the expression of regenerating relevant genes by directly binding to the promoter of targeted genes and through a mechanism independent of H3K27me3 deposition. Together, we unravel a requirement but divergent mechanisms of EZH1 in heart development and regeneration

DESIGN
For early embryonic state, RNA-seq was performed on DKO, E1KO, E2KO and WT E12.5 heart ventricular. For the MI heart, RNA-seq was performed on EZH1 and GFP overexpressing heart apex below the ligation site, the heart was injected with AAV9 expressing Ezh1 or GFP respectively. As for the sham control, RNA-seq was also performed on the heart apex part
