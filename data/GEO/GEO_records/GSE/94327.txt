TITLE
The redox-sensitive regulatory module of cyclophilin 20-3, 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin and cysteine synthase in the high light acclimation response in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Previous data suggest that 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin, cyclophilin 20-3 and the cysteine synthase complex work as a dynamically interacting module (here named COPS-module) and are involved in stress response. In this study we performed global transcriptome analyses to investigate the responses to short-term high light in wildtype and mutants deficient in each protein of COPS-module. The global transcriptomic response in leaves to 6 h high light in Col.0 and mutants deficient in each protein of COPS-module.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines and wildtype plants were grown in soil under short-day (8h light / 16h dark cycles) and normal light conditions. When the plants reached the age of 4 weeks they were tranferred to high light for 6 h or maintained in normal light. The leaf material of treated plants was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicates from each condition were analyzed.
