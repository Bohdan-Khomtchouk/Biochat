TITLE
GDNF-regulated gene expression in cultured mouse spermatogonial stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GDNF-regulated gene expression was studied in cultures of actively self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells established from 6 day old male mice. GDNF is the essential growth factor regulating mouse spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Using a serum-free chemically defined culture system that supports mouse spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal for extended periods of time, GDNF-regulated genes were identified using microarray profiling. Keywords: GDNF withdrawal and time-course replacement
