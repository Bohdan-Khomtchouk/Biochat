TITLE
Human Prostate Cancer Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 (HM450K bead array) BeadChip samples (benign vs tumor)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to examine the impact our probe filtering efforts might have on the analysis of real-world primary data, we analyzed clinical prostate cancer specimens. This included profiling of four prostate tumour tissue samples and four benign prostate tissues using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 (HM450K bead array) BeadChip. These samples were used to explore the effects on analysis with and without a probe filtering.

DESIGN
Four tumour samples containing Gleason 6 cancer and four benign samples from other prostate glands containing Gleason 6 cancer were selected for study. Tissue samples were cryosectioned for histopathological assessment. Genomic DNA was extracted from the homogenized samples using the Allprep Micro Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following manufacturerâ€™s instructions and bisulfite converted using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research Corporation, CA, USA). The resulting libraries were hybridized onto the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450K bead array) BeadChip. Raw intensity data was generated using an iScan microarray reader (Illumina).
