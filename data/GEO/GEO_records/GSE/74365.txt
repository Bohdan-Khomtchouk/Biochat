TITLE
Ribosomal profiling in Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ribosome profiling in Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial cells which data set is used to calcualte codon-specific ribosome occupancy using the approach described by Lareau et al. eLife 2014.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling of cells at steady state. 3 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
