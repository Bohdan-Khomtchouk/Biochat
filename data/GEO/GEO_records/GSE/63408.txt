TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of  fungus Penicillium oxalicum and its laeA and creA deletion strains

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare differential gene expressions for Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain (WT), laeA knockout strain (ΔlaeA), creA knockout strain (ΔcreA), and double genes knockout strain (ΔlaeAΔcreA). The deletion of laeA downregulated genes involved in oxidation- reduction process, alkaloid metabolic process, and transmembrane transport. We find the expression levels of seven secondary metabolism gene clusters (totally 28 clusters) were silenced inΔlaeA. The deletion of creA upregulated genes involved in hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds. Many genes involved in conidiation were drastically regulated inΔlaeAΔcreA. This study provides the information that combined laeA and creA function are required in conidiation and hydrolase activity of P. oxalicum.

DESIGN
Examination of differential gene expressions by digital gene expression tag profiling in Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain and three mutant strains (laeA knockout strain, creA knockout strain and double genes knockout strain). qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.
