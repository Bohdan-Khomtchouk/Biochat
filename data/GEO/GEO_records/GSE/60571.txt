TITLE
RNA-Seq of female, male, and sex-transformed Drosophila melanogaster heads from flies heterozygous for deletions on chromosome X and 3L

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To measure the response to gene dose, we performed mRNA-Seq of fly heads with molecularly defined deletions constructed from DrosDel deficiency lines (Ryder et al. Genetics 2007, 177(1):615-29) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

DESIGN
We performed single-end next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) on poly-A+ RNA extracted from adult female and male heads in biological triplicate. Besides wildtype females (XX) and males (XY) that were heterozygous for deletions, we also sequenced females that were transformed into males (XX males) by using mutations in the sex determination gene transformer-2 (tra2). The original lines with deletions, including 22 deletions on the chromosome X and 12 deletions on the chromosome 3L, were from the DrosDel project. The diploid controls without DrosDel deletions were derived from w1118 (the parental line of DrosDel stocks) or Oregon-R Strain. We sequenced a total of 249 samples.
