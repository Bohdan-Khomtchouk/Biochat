TITLE
Gene expression in human endometrial cancer tissues and serous papillary endometrial cancer cell line, SPAC-1L, treated by STAT1-siRNA and/or IFN-gamma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies, and patients with high grade disease, especially  serous papillary subtype (SPEC) are often related to the poor outcomes. Recent genome-wide analyses have revealed that SPEC exhibits gene expression profiles that are distinct from the endometrioid histologic subtype; therefore, it is important to identify the SPEC driver genes or pathways responsible for the inherently aggressive phenotypes and to develop SPEC-specific therapies to target these driver genes or pathways. Through array-based analysis and immunohistochemical staining of human endometrial cancer tissue, STAT1 is identified high expressed, and can distinguish SPEC from other subtypes of endometrial cancer. In vitro and in vivo experiments show STAT1 role as a pro-survival factor in SPEC. STAT1 was identified as a master gene modulating “transcriptional pro-survival pathways” to enhance multiple malignant characteristics  These finding may suggest that targeting of STAT1, the SPEC driver gene, may provide the means to improve poor outcomes for patients with SPEC.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to clarify the changes of gene expression along with STAT1-siRNA treatment and to confirm whether there are any changes on genes expression related to STAT1 pathway. We also used the microarray data to clarify genes signatures which can distinguish subtype of human endometrial cancers.
