TITLE
miRNAs expression in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines: Vector Control vs. Twist1, Bcl-2, and Twist1/Bcl-2 Transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs profiling of HepG2 cells comparing vector-control treated HepG2 cells with HepG2 cells transfected with Twist1, Bcl-2, and Twist1/Bcl-2 plasmids. Microarray analysis revealed a panel of miRNAs with significant differential expression among these four HCC cell lines.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, four HCC cell lines ( HepG2-Twist1, HepG2-Bcl-2, HepG2-Twist1/Bcl-2 HCC cell lines, and  HepG2-vector cell lines ) was used to analyze miRNA expression profiles. HepG2-Twist1, HepG2-Bcl-2, HepG2-Twist1/Bcl-2 HCC cell lines can stably express Twist1, Bcl-2, and Twist1/Bcl-2, respectively.
