TITLE
Gene silencing of BSK65-MONO1 (RNF185) and of its natural antisense RNA (RNF185-AS) using siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray profiles of native HeLa cells and RNF185/BSK65 gene silenced HeLa cells using siRNAs LMG2 and LMG4 were monitored using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.

DESIGN
Two independent microarray assays of each analysis were used for the comparison of native vs. siRNA treated HeLa cells with LMG2 and LMG4.
