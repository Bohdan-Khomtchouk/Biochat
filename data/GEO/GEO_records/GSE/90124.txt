TITLE
DNA methylome analysis of skin samples from punch tissue biopsy of 322 healthy female individuals and total body naevus count

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide genomic DNA profiling with the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k) of skin samples. The skin tissue DNA was derived from a peri-umbilical punch biopsy (adipose tissue was removed from the biopsy before freezing) from 322 healthy female twins of the TwinsUK cohort. Family structure is present in this data. If the samples are related they will share a similar Relatedness identification ID either monozygotic_twinpair_* or dizygotic_twinpair_*

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 322 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
