TITLE
RNA-seq of control and talpid2 facial prominences

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We report the RNA profiles of both control and talpid2 frontonasal, maxillary, and mandibular prominences of the chick face at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 25. For more details please see: " The cellular and molecular etiology of the craniofacial defects in the avian ciliopathic mutant, talpid2. "

DESIGN
Facial prominences (frontonasal, maxillary, and mandibular) from 8 control and 8 talpid2 HH 25 embryos were harvested, pooled, and RNA-seq was preformed on samples.

PLATFORM
GPL16133 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Gallus gallus)
