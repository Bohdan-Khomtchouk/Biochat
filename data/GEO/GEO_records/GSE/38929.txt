TITLE
Patterns of aberrant DNA methylation after toxicant-induced malignant transformation (miRNA dataset)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in cancer. The aim of this study was to determine how DNA methylation is changed after arsenic-induced malignant transformation.

DESIGN
Arsenite-transformed RWPE-1 cells (n=2) are compared to parental RWPE-1 cells (n=2). Normal PrEC (n=2) are included for comparison. Immunoprecipitation using anti-methylcytosine (5MeC) antibody.

PLATFORM
GPL13339 Agilent Human custom chip-on-chip 2 x 105k tiling microarray AMADID: 024305
