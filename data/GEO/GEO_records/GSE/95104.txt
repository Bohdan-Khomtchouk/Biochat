TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of the Host Response and Innate Resilience to Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Infection in Humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a globally prevalent cause of diarrhea. We report the first gene expression analysis of the human host response to experimental challenge with ETEC.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis performed on whole peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in whom severe symptoms developed and a subset of those who remained asymptomatic.
