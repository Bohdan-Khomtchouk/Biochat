TITLE
PNET animal model: new insights

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently, we described a new animal model of CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS-PNET), which was generated by orthotopic transplantation of human Radial Glial (RG) cells into NOD-SCID mice’s brain sub- ventricular zone. In the current study we conducted comprehensive RNA-Seq analyses to gain some insights on the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis in this mouse model of CNS-PNET. Here we show that the RNA-Seq profiles derived from these tumors cluster with those reported for patients’ PNETs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of tumors from central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS PNET) animal model

PLATFORM
