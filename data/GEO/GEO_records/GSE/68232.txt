TITLE
Extruded linseed alone or in combination with fish oil modifies mammary gene expression profiles in lactating goats

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Animal nutrition considerably affects milk composition that influences its nutritional quality. Milk component synthesis and secretion by the mammary gland involve the expression of a large number of genes whose nutritional regulation remains poorly defined. In this study, 14 lactating goats received 3 experimental diets: 1- the basal diet with hay prepared from regrowth of natural grassland pasture offered ad libitum and a concentrate mixture (CTRL, n = 5)), the basal diet with 530 g/d extruded linseed (EL, n = 4) or with a combination of 340 g/d extruded linseed and 39 g/d of fish oil (ELFO, n = 5). To investigate the pathways regulated by nutrition, we examined the effect of EL and ELFO diets compared with CRTL diet and the effect of EL diet compared to ELFO diet on the expression of approximately 8400 genes in caprine mammary gland using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray.
