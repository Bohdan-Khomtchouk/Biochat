TITLE
XX-650-23, an inhibitor of CREB-CBP interaction, effect on acute myeloid leukemia cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute myeloid leukemia KG1 cells treated with XX-650-23 (5 mM) for 12hrs. XX-650-23 inhibits proliferation of KG1 cells. Results provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying by the inhibitory activity of XX-650-23 on acute leukemia.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of KG1 cells treated with XX-650-23 were generated by deep sequencing. CREB genome binding profiles of KG1 cells treated with XX-650-23 were generated by deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
