TITLE
Effects of jasplakinolide on gene expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Actin polymerization can regulate smooth muscle gene expression but the full extent of this regulation is unknown. To understand the full impact of actin polymerization on smooth muscle gene expression cells were cultured with the actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide for 24h.

DESIGN
Mouse aortic smooth muscle cells in passage 3-4 were cultured for 24h in DMEM 10%FCS with or without 100nM jasplakinolide. RNA was isolated using Qiagen mRNeasy according to standard protocol
