TITLE
A recombinant lentiviral PDGF-driven mouse model of proneural GBM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Informed by the genetic alterations observed in human GBM, we engineered a novel, lentiviral injection mediated, mouse model of proneural GBM.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PDGF-driven primary GBM tumors arising in the ShCdkn2a-PDGFB-T2A-CreERT2 mouse model developed in our study was analysed to determine to which transcriptomic subtype of GBM these specimens belonged.
