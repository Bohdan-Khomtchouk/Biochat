TITLE
Autoimmune antigen and serum factor antigen reactivity in a cohort of patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1(APS-1) and healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that APS-1 patient sera contains IgG reactivity to serum factor antigens concomitant with prototypical autoimmne antigens. We diluted patient sera 1:250 and incubated dilutions on a nitrocellulose-platform array printed with whole protein antigens.

DESIGN
In this study, serum from 14 ndividuals (subsetted into APS-1 patient and healthy control categories) was profiled for IgG autoantibody reactivity to whole protein autoimmune and serum factor antigens. APS-1 patient sera was found using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm to be significantly more reactive with prototypical cytokine antigens previously identified as targets of autoantibodies.
