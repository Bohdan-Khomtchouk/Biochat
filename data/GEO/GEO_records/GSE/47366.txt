TITLE
MicroRNA expression array for 1833 cells expressing RKIP vs. control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RKIP has been implicated in suppression of breast tumor metastasis. Identification of microRNAs regulated by RKIP helps us to understand how RKIP suppresses tumor metastasis via its downstream target mircoRNAs and genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 1833 cells expressing RKIP or control, respectively. Exiqon miRCURY LNA array v.11.0. was performed to identify the microRNAs regulated by RKIP.

PLATFORM
