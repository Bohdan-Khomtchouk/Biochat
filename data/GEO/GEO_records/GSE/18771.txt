TITLE
Mouse KIAA1718 knockdown ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profiles of ESCs stably expressing control and KIAA1718 short hairpin RNA, using Affymetrix microarray.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells R1 were transformed with the respective lenti-virus expressing Luc shRNA or KIAA1718 shRNA1. The transformed ES cells were sorted for GFP. Total RNAs were extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For microarray experiments, RNA was processed and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manifactureâ€™s instruction.
