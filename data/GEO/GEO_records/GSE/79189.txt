TITLE
The gene expression analysis of human astrocyte exposure to anti-suprabasin antibody: identification of a novel antibody for neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[Objectives]: Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is often difficult to diagnose and distinguish from those of other diseases, because no specific antibodies have yet been detected.  [Methods]: We developed a novel proteomic strategy for identifying and profiling antigens in immune complexes (ICs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 26 NPSLE patients. We performed in vitro experiments using astrocytes and analyzed functional change by microarray.  [Results]: We identified ICs of suprabasin (SBSN), a molecule which is thought to play a role in epidermal differentiation. Microarray data showed that the senescence and autophagy pathways were significantly changed in astrocytes with anti-SBSN antibody exposure compared to normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) exposure.  [Conclusions]: These findings indicate that SBSN could be a novel autoantibody for the evaluation of suspected NPSLE, and may help elucidate the pathogenesis underlying this disease.

DESIGN
The cultured human astrocyte exposed to non IgG, control rabbit IgG and anti suprabasin antibodies with or without lipopolysaccharide (1Î¼g/ml) for 24 h were collected for RNA isolation. We divided into the following 6 samples, Non IgG LPS(-), Non IgG LPS(+), Norm IgG LPS(-), Norm IgG LPS(+), SBSN LPS(-) and SBSN IgG LPS(+).
