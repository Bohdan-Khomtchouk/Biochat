TITLE
Gene expression profiling from high-fat medium (HFM)-treated and growth medium (GM)-treated Sk-hep1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major problem in obese peoples and caused by unbalanced uptake of fatty acid. Novel drug identification is necessary to develop effective therapies. We combine LOPACÂ® and High-Content system to identify compounds significantly reducing intracellular lipid droplets after high fat medium (HFM) treatment. Among 1280 compounds, 5 show efficacy in lipid droplet reduction. To construct the underlying regulatory network, whole-genome transcriptomic, pathway, and connectivity map analysis are performed.

DESIGN
To know the gene expression profiles after high-fat environment incubation, total RNAs from the following 4 groups were extracted for whole trancriptomic analysis : (1)Sk-hep1 cells treated with 12 hr GM; (2) Sk-hep1 cells treated with 12 hr HFM; (3) Sk-hep1 cells treated with 24 hr GM; (4) Sk-hep1 cells treated with 24 hr HFM.
