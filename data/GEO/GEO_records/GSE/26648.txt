TITLE
Expression data from non-metastatic and metastatic osteosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the malignant bone tumor with a high tendency to metastasize to the lung, where the molecular mechanisms are unclear. The mouse OS cell line LM8 has been isolated originally from the Dunn OS cell line by in vivo selection as a subline with a high metastatic potential to the lung. We used gene chip-based global gene expression analysis of differential screening between parental Dunn and LM8 cells in order to reveal genes predominantly expressed in LM8 cells, which correlate with high metastatic potential.

DESIGN
2 cell lines
