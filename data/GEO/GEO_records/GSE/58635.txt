TITLE
Influences of fibulin-5 and cleaved fibulin-5 on gene expression patterns of fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the relevance and the impact of the cleaved FBLN5 variant on fibroblastâ€™s physiology, we have employed whole genome microarrays. Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts from three different donors were seeded in duplicates on plates pre-coated with FBLN5, cleaved FBLN5 or heat denatured BSA as a control. After cultivation for 24 h, RNA was isolated and microarrays were performed. Statistical analysis of microarrays resulted in 367 genes significantly differentially expressed in cells cultured on a FBLN5 matrix and 525 genes differentially expressed in cells cultured on a cleaved FBLN5 matrix compared to control (adjusted p-value < 0.05). To further validate these gene expression changes identified by microarray analysis 10 randomly choosen genes were reanalyzed by qRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction). In nine cases the fold changes measured by qRT-PCR were comparable with those measured by microarray analysis, revealing reproducibility and validity of analysis.

DESIGN
Fibulin-5 and cleaved FBLN5 contributed to changes in expression pattern of human neonatal dermal fibroblasts after cultivation for 24 h. Three different donors were used in technical duplicates.
