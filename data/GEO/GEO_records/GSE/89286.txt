TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with eEF1A overexpression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The canonical role of eEF1A is to deliver the aminoacyl tRNA to the ribosome, we have used the yeast model system to investigate further roles for this protein. We used microarray to study the transcriptomic effects of elevated levels of eEF1A on yeast cells during log phase growth

DESIGN
Yeast cells were grown to log phase, the RNA extracted and hybridised to affymetrix arrays.
