TITLE
Ventilator-induced lung injury in C57BL\6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken to examine differential gene expression across the whole genome during short-term ventilator-induced lung injury in mice, a commonly used model of acute lung injury, as compared with spontaneous ventilation. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by ketamine/xylaxine. Saline (0.25 ml) was given every hour ip. A tracheotomy tube was placed and the mice were ventilated with an initial peak airway pressure of 20 cmH2O approximating a tidal volume of 20 ml/kg and without end-expiratory pressure. Ventilation was continued for 3h. Tidal volume was not adjusted. Body temperature was monitored with a digital rectal thermometer and maintained at 37C with a heating table and external heating lamp. Control mice were treated identically, but were not mechanically ventilated (i.e. breathed spontaneously). There were 5 biological relicates in each group.
