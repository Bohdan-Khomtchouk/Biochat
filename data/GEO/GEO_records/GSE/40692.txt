TITLE
P6 Mouse Sertoli Cell Small RNA seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study annotates the NGS reads in a Sertoli cell sncRNA library.  In addition to known sncRNAs, we also identified numerous novel sncRNAs expressed by Sertoli cells.  Our data suggest that the Sertoli cell sncRNA transcriptome predominantly consists of miRNAs, piRNA-like RNAs, tRNAs and snoRNAs.  This study reports the first comprehensive annotation of the Sertoli cell sncRNA transcriptome.

DESIGN
Sertoli cells were purified from post-natal day 6 C57Bl/6 mice using the STAPUT unit gravity sedimentation apparatus.  Small RNA was isolated from cells and a cDNA library was generated for 454 sequencing.  Sequences from FastA files were initially mapped to known sequences and the genome and subsequently annotated upon novel small RNA categorization.
