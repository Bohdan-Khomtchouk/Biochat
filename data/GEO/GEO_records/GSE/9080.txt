TITLE
Expression data from Annexin A1 Ac1-25 vs. Unstimulated human peripheral blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes elicited by stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes from buffy coats with 50ÂµM Annexin A1 peptide Ac1-25 for 2h versus unstimulated control monocytes. Keywords: comparative gene expression study

DESIGN
three independent monocyte isolations each were used for stimulated and control cell RNA preparations and subsequent hybridization to arrays according to manufacturers protocols
