TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 to limiting iron availability

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
A. baumannii ATCC 17978 cells were incubated under iron replete (mueller-hinton) and iron limiting (MH + 200 ÂµM 2,2'-dipyridyl) conditions, total RNA was extracted when cultures reached OD600=0.7.

DESIGN
The probes on the microarray cover all predicted open reading frames (at least 4 per ORF) and additional replicates of housekeeping genes of the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 genome
