TITLE
Small RNA and High Molecular Weight RNA Deep Sequencing Analysis of miR-17~92 Mimics Transfected HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient transfection of miRNA mimics are widely used to alter microRNA expression in cells. The goal of this study is to perform small RNA deep sequencing analysis of HeLa cells transfected with miR-17~92 cluster and address potential source of non-specific effects caused by this approach.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were cultured as adherent cells. Equal molar concentration of miRNA mimics of miR-17~92 (100nM, 16.7nM each) were transfected and harvedsted at 6h post-transfection for small RNA deep sequencing analysis.
