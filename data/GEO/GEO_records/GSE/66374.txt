TITLE
Immediate response of hematopoietic stem cells to low doses of γ-irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) 2 hours after irradiation at 0Gy, 0.02Gy and 2.5Gy. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying LT-HSCs immediate response to low doses of γ-irradiation compared to high doses.

DESIGN
Three samples were analyzed and correlated with the control group (0Gy).
