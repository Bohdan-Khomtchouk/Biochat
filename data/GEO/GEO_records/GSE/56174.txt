TITLE
Microevolution of Candida albicans in macrophages restores filamentation in a nonfilamentous mutant

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Following antifungal treatment, Candida albicans, and other human pathogenic fungi can undergo microevolution, which leads to the emergence of drug resistance. However, the capacity for microevolutionary adaptation of fungi goes beyond the development of drug resistance. Here we used an experimental microevolution approach to show that one of the central pathogenicity mechanisms of C. albicans, the yeast-to-hyphae transition, can be subject to experimental evolution. The C. albicans cph1Δ/efg1Δ mutant is non-filamentous, as central signalling pathways linking environmental cues to hypha formation are disrupted. We subjected this mutant to constant selection pressure in the hostile environment of the macrophage phagosome. In a comparatively short time-frame, the mutant evolved the ability to escape macrophages by filamentation. To investigate the transcriptional response underlying the yeast-to-filament transition in the evolved strain, we applied RNA-Seq technology. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data were used to identify SNPs, which are specific for the evolved strain.

DESIGN
For both strains, the cph1Δ/efg1Δ mutant and the Evo-strain, two conditions, one promotes yeast growth the other filamentous growth, were investigated. For each condition three biological replicates were analysed.
