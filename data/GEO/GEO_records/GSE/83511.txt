TITLE
To find out different expression lncRNAs between glioblastoma cancer and adjacent normal glioblastoma tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular mechanisms in the development of glioblastoma cancer, we employed this microarray to identify lncRNAs associated with glioblastoma cancer.

DESIGN
4 pairs of glioblastoma cancer tissues and normal glioblastoma tissues were collected after glioma operation.
