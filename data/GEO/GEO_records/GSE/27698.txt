TITLE
Characterization of a Lactococcus lactis high-temperature mutant with increased glycolytic flux

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
Temperature is an important factor affecting biological organisms. We characterize a Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) ssp. cremoris MG1363 mutant (CS3527) capable of growing better at a higher temperature than its parent. The transcriptomic analysis also revealed widespread down-regulation of genes encoding membrane transport proteins in the wild-type at 38°C. A fatty acid composition analysis revealed that the mutant has substantially more straight chained saturated and less cyclopropane fatty acids at 30°C and 38°C compared with the wild-type.

DESIGN
MG1363 versus CS3527 at two different growth temperatures

PLATFORM
GPL13249 Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 15K 60-mer array, Version 1
