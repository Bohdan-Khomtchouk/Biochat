TITLE
Near-whole-genome transcriptome analysis of gene expression in human skeletal muscle tissue at baseline in obese individuals with Type 2 Diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression associated with exercise response. The hypothesis tested was that individuals with Type 2 Diabetes that failed to demonstrate exercise-induced metabolic improvements would also reflect this lack of response in their skeletal muscle transcriptional profile at baseline. Of 186 genes identified by microarray analysis, 70% were upregulated in Responders and downregulated in Non-responders. Several genes involved in substrate metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis differed significantly between the groups at baseline. This differential baseline gene expression indicated that Non-responders had blunted oxidative capacity.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from baseline samples of skeletal muscle of obese individuals with Type 2 Diabetes who were characterized as either Responders or Non-responders was examined for differential expression of exercise response-assocated genes.
