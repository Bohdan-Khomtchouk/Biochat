TITLE
Analysis of the turkey skeletal muscle transcriptome through development within a genetic line (Experiment 1)

ORGANISM
Meleagris gallopavo

SUMMARY
The purpose of Experiment 1 was two-fold:  a) to evaluate a unique set of negative, distance, and mismatch control probes on the newly designed 6K TSKMLO microarray, and b) to identify patterns of gene expression in skeletal muscle during development.  Negative and mismatch controls confirmed specific hybridization using this array, and genes identified as differentially expressed between developmental stages by microarray analysis were confirmed by qRT-PCR.  Novel candidate genes and pathways were identified as playing potentially crucial roles in turkey skeletal muscle development with implications for improving turkey meat quality defects and growth-induced myopathies long-term.
