TITLE
Gene expression profiles during osteoclastogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expressions of mRNA in osteoclast precursors treated with RANKL and M-CSF for 0, 24, and 72 h. We used DNA microarray to analyze the changes in mRNA expressions during osteoclastogegesis.

DESIGN
Osteoclast precursors were induced from mouse bone marrow cells by M-CSF for 3 days and treated with RANKL. WE extracted total RNA and analyzed by DNA microarray.
