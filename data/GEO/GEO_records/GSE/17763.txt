TITLE
Divergence of macrophage phagocytic and antimicrobial programs in leprosy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effective innate immunity against many microbial pathogens requires macrophage programs that upregulate phagocytosis and direct antimicrobial pathways, two functions generally assumed to be coordinately regulated.  Here the regulation of these key functions was investigated in human blood-derived macrophages.  IL-10 induced the phagocytic pathway, including CD209 and scavenger receptors, resulting in phagocytosis of mycobacteria and oxLDL.  IL-15 induced the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway and CD209, yet the cells were less phagocytic.  The differential regulation of macrophage functional programs was confirmed by analysis of the spectrum of leprosy lesions: the macrophage phagocytosis pathway was prominent in the clinically progressive, multibacillary form, whereas the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway predominated in the self-limited form of the disease and in patients undergoing reversal reactions from the multibacillary to the self-limited form.  These data indicate that macrophage programs for phagocytosis and antimicrobial responses are distinct and differentially regulated in innate immunity in bacterial infections.
