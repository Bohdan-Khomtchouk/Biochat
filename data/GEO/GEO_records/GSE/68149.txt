TITLE
RNA Seq Comparison of midguts collected from Asian longhorned beetles larvae feeding on sugar maples and a nutrient-rich artificial diet

ORGANISM
Anoplophora glabripennis

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare RNA Seq profiles of Asian longhorned beetle larval guts feeding on two different substrates to identify key genes involved in woody tissue degradation, nutrient scavenging, and detoxification of host plant defensive compounds.

DESIGN
RNA Seq profiles of four third instar larvae feeding on a nutrient rich artificial diet and on sugar maple trees were generating using the Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
