TITLE
Dual transcriptomic analysis of the interaction between the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N and soil Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp

SUMMARY
In order to get insights into the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to perceive their biotic environment as well as into the mechanisms of the interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria, we analysed the transcriptomic response of the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor and the strain Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp during their interactions in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed six hybridizations (shotgun DNA microarray) with samples derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp cultivated alone or with Laccaria bicolor S238N in vitro (3 control  biological replicates and 3 biological replicates with L. bicolor)

PLATFORM
GPL18299 Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp microarray
