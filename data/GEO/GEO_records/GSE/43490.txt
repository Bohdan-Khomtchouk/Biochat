TITLE
Transcriptional interaction network analyses in dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve, locus coeruleus and substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptomic profile of post-mortem explants from dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve, locus coeruleus and substantia nigra obtained from controls and Braak 4 (BK4) and 5 (BK5) stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients in order to investigate how gene-gene interaction patterns vary along different anatomical regions in patients and controls. The comparative transcriptional networks analyses indicate that the main hubs in PD networks are related to ubquitin/proteasome, oxidative stress, neuroprotection, neurogenesis and PD associated proteins.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiles of controls and Parkinson’s disease patients were compared using SAM test for LC or Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test for SN and VA (p < 0.005 and p < 0.01, respectively) in order to identify differentially expressed transcripts.
