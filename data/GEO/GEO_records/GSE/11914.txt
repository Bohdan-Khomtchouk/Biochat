TITLE
Expression data from LNCaP cells transfected with SOX4 cDNA, SOX4 siRNA or GFP cDNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX4 is a critical developmental transcription factor in vertebrates and is required for   precise differentiation and proliferation in multiple tissues.  In addition, SOX4 is   overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of SOX4 in cancer   progression is not well understood.  Here we have either eliminated SOX4 using siRNA or overexpressed a SOX4 cDNA and compared the gene expression patterns against control GFP transfections to identify SOX4 target genes. Data described in manuscript P. Liu et al., Cancer Res 46, 4011 (April 15, 2006) Keywords: Gene Expression
