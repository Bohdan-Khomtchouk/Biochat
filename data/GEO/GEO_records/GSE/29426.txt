TITLE
Effect of FGF15 or FGF19 on mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse FGF15 and human FGF19 are orthologous proteins that regulate bile acid metabolism.  However, other hepatic functions of FGF15/19 are not well characterized.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to analyze global hepatic gene expression in mice administered FGF15 or FGF19. Total liver RNA was isolated from wild-type mice administered vehicle, purified FGF15 or recombinant FGF19 for 6 hr via a jugular vein injection as described (Inagaki et al., 2005).  Mice did not have access to food throughout the 6 hr treatment, and livers were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Microarray analyses were performed using the Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array.
