TITLE
Expression analysis of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 in presence of heavy metals

ORGANISM
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34

SUMMARY
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is a metal resistant beta-proteobacterium. The genome of this bacterium contain many genes involved in heavy metal resistance. Gene expression of C. metallidurans was studied after the addition of of Zn(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Hg(II) or Co(II). Keywords: Heavy metal stress response

DESIGN
Cultures of C. metallidurans CH34 were grown at 30°C until OD reached 0.6 (mid- exponential phase cultures). Heavy metals (0.8 mM of Zn(II), 0.5 mM of Cd(II), 0.1 mM of Cu(II), 0.6 mM of Ni(II), 0.4 mM of Pb(II), 5 uM of Hg(II) and 0.5 mM of Co(II)) were added to the culture for 30 minutes induction time. Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed and labeled with Cy3-dCTP for the control (without metal) and with Cy5-dCTP for each conditions (challenged with one metal). Labeled cDNA were (control and one condition) added to a spotted slide for overnight hybridization at 42°C. Slides were scanned with a laser at 532 and 635 nm.
