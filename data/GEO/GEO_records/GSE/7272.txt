TITLE
Expression analysis of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 in presence of heavy metals

ORGANISM
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34

SUMMARY
Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is a metal resistant beta-proteobacterium. The genome of this bacterium contain many genes involved in heavy metal resistance. Gene expression of C. metallidurans was studied after the addition of of Zn(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Hg(II) or Co(II). Keywords: Heavy metal stress response
