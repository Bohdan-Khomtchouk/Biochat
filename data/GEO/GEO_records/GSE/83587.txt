TITLE
Effect of exogenous FABP4 (A-FABP/aP2) and FABP5 (E-FABP/mal1) on gene expression in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) and 233A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of treatment with FABP4 or FABP5 in ADSC and 233A cells was examined.

DESIGN
ADSC or 233A cells were treated with and without 1 ÂµM recombinant FABP4 or FABP5.
