TITLE
Comparison of mRNA expression profiles of 3q21q26 and 3q21q26::Gata2+/– mouse leukemic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The 3q21q26 mice harboring a transgene recapitulating GATA2 enhancer-drived EVI1 overexpression in inv(3)(q21q26) allele develop leukemia. Gata2 heterogenous deletion accelerates leukemogenesis of the 3q21q26 mice. To get insights into the couse of the acceleration of leukemogenesis, RNA-sequencing analysis was performed using B220+Gr1–cKit+ populations containing leukemia-initiating cells in bone marrows of leukemic 3q21q26 and 3q21q26::Gata2+/– mice.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of B220+Gr1–cKit+ populations in bone marrows of leukemic 3q21q26 and 3q21q26::Gata2+/– mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
