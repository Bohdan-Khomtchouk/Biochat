TITLE
Expression data from murine subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two types of adipose tissues, white and brown, are found in mammals. Increasingly novel strategies are being proposed for the treatment of obesity and its associated complications by altering amount and/or activity of BAT using mouse models. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue.

DESIGN
White adipose tissue (Subcutaneous region) and brown adipose tissue (intrascapular) were isolated from LACA mice (male, 25 Â± 3g ) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
