TITLE
Global Genome Repair factors are essential for shaping the DNA methylation landscape in Arabidopsis [small RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the small RNA analysis of Arabidopsis plants deficient for the expression DDB2 involved in global genome repair using small RNA sequencing. In addition we performed RNA  immunoprecipitation  (RIP) of DDB2.

DESIGN
siRNA sequencing in WT,  ddb2-3 and nrpd1a plants

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
