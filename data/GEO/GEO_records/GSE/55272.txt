TITLE
Reduced Expression of the Proto-oncogene Myc Increases Mouse Longevity and Enhances Healthspan

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MYC is a pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates numerous pathways and whose deregulation promotes cancer. Myc+/- mice have extended lifespan relative to their wild type littermates. To better understand the effects of the Myc+/- genotype on cellular processes, microarrays were performed on young (5 month) and old (24 month) Myc+/- and WT males in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. Microarray data were used to compare the effects of aging with the effects of the Myc+/- genotype at each age, to identify pathways enriched for differentially expressed genes, and to compare the Myc+/- gene expression signature with that from other long-lived mice.

DESIGN
Male mice of each genotype (Myc+/- and wild type) were sacrificed at 5 months and 24 months of age, and tissues were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted, and pooled between 5-8 mice within each cohort, creating one pooled sample for each combination of age, genotype, and tissue. Three technical replicates were run for each sample.
