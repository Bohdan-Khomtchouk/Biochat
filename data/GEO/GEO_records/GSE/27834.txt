TITLE
miR-371-3 expression predicts neural differentiation potential in human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The use of pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine and disease modeling is complicated by the variation in differentiation properties between lines. In this study, we characterized 13 human embryonic stem cell.  (hESC) and 26 human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines to identify markers that predict neural differentiation behavior. At a general level, markers previously known to distinguish mouse ESCs from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) correlated with neural differentiation behavior. More specifically, quantitative analysis of miR-371-3 expression prospectively identified hESC and hiPSC lines with differential neurogenic differentiation propensity and in vivo dopamine neuron engraftment potential. Transient KLF4 transduction increased miR-371-3 expression and altered neurogenic behavior and pluripotency marker expression. Conversely, suppression of miR- 371-3 expression in KLF4-transduced cells rescued neural differentiation propensity. miR-371-3 expression level therefore appears to have both a predictive and a functional role in determining human pluripotent stem cell neurogenic differentiation behavior.

DESIGN
[mRNA profiling (Illumina)]: Four human ESC lines (H9, I4, I6, HUES6) at undifferentiation stages were purified with stem cell surface marker SSEA4 and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Illumina microarrays. Each sample has 3 biological repeats, one of which has two technical repeats. [miRNA profiling (Agilent)]: Four human ESC lines (H9, I4, I6, HUES6) at undifferentiation stages were purified with stem cell surface marker SSEA4 and subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays. Each sample has 3 biological repeats, one of which has two technical repeats.
