TITLE
The transcription factor SOX6 contributes to the developmental origins of obesity by promoting adipogenesis through inhibition of Wnt signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The developmental transcription factor SOX6 was found to regulate serum, as well as liver triglycerides in BL6 mice treated with SOX6 antisense gapmers compared to control gapmers. SOX6 was initially discovered as a gene over-expressed in mesenchymal stem cells derived from small for gestational age newborns. We characterized its metabolic function in BL6 mice using the above antisense knockdown approach.

DESIGN
BL6 mice were treated with either SOX6 specific or control gapmer oligonucleotides for 48h. Knockdown efficiency was measured in liver and epididymal white adipose tissues and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol quantified.
