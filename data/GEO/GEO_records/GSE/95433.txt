TITLE
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mouse antigen specific T cells (CD8+Spas1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, we seek to evalulate the apoptotic gene expression on antigen specific T cells. (CD45+CD3+CD8+Spas-1) after different checkpoint inhibitors treatments

DESIGN
Mice were implanted with TRAMP-C2 tumors(10^6/mouse) at Day 0 and treated with different checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 DANA, Combo DANA, isotype. Draining lymph nodes were harvested at Day 28. Five mice from each group were pooled together and sorted on CD45+CD3+CD8+Spas-1 antigen specific T cells. Sorted cells were dissolved in RNA later and subsequent for RNA extraction and cDNA generation. RT-PCR array were run on Qiagen kit and analysed on Qiagen website under data analysis center
