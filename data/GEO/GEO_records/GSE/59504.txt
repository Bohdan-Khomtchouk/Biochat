TITLE
Comparative phenotypic and genome-wide expression analysis of ancestral Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a strain with higher flux through the pentose phosphate pathway

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
By an evolutionary approach based on long-term culture on gluconate as the sole carbon source, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains with enhanced flux through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway were obtained. One of these evolved strains, ECA5, exhibited several novel properties with great potential for wine making, including a higher than wild-type fermentation rate and altered production of acetate and aroma compounds. To describe the mechanisms underlying this complex phenotype, we performed a comparative analysis of transcriptomic profiles between ECA5 and its ancestral strain, EC1118, under low nitrogen, wine fermentation conditions.

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA collected at 45g of CO2 realesed (stationary phase) for comparison of ECA5 and EC1118 strains

PLATFORM
