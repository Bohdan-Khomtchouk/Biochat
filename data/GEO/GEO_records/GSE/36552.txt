TITLE
Tracing pluripotency of human early embryos and embryonic stem cells by single cell RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Find the casual relationship between gene expression network and cellular phenotype at single cell resolution. We collected donated human pre-implatation embryos, and the embryonic stem cells derived from them, isolate individual cells, prepared single cell cDNAs, and sequenced them by HiSeq2000. Then we analyzed the expression of known RefSeq genes.

DESIGN
We get transcriptome of 124 individual cells from human pre-implantation embryos and human embryonic stem cells by applying single cell RNA-seq technique we recently developed[1][2][3][4]. We did in-depth bioinformatic analysis to these data and found very dynamic expression of protein-coding genes. [1] Tang, F. et al.
