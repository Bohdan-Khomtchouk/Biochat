TITLE
Gate-Keeping transcription through histone H3 K42, a novel site of methylation in the yeast nucleosome core

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
A new site of methylation was identified on histone H3 K42 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations were engineered at this site to mimic either a constitutively modified state, K42L, or a constitutively unmodified state, K42Q in addition to an alanine substitution. K42A. The effects of these mutations on global transcription was monitored in yeast cells whose sole source of histone H3 was from a plasmid expressing these mutant proteins, and compared to that of an isogenic strain expressing the wild-type histone H3 protein from the same plasmid.
