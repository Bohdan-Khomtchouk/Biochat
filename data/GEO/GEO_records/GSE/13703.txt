TITLE
Transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high glucose (20%) concentration

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cells can be affected during their growth to several stress conditions. One of the most known and characterised is the osmotic stress and most of the studies about osmotic sterss response in yeast have been focused on salt or sorbitol stress. However, during yeast growth in industrially relevant processes (for instance throughout alcoholic fermentation on the must to produce alcoholic beverages) the osmotic stress is mainly due to the high sugar(in particular glucose) concentration (200-250 g/L).

DESIGN
In this study we want to know the transcriptional response of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae when it was grown in a medium with high glucose concentration. For this aim we have grown yeast in YP medium containing 2% of glucose in cultures overnight and after that we diluted this cultures to an OD600 of 0.1 in two differents mediums: YP containing 2% or 20% of glucose.One hour later of inoculation we collect the cells and quikly frozen in liquid nitrogen. We extracted the total mRNA of the cells and after that we did the microarrays, comparing cells were grown in YP2 media against the cells were grown in YP20 media.
