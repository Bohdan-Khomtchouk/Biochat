TITLE
ChIP-on-chip of OmpR binding in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 and E.scherichia coli strain CSH50 at pH 7 and pH 4.5 including analysis of OmpR binding in SL1344 in the absence and presence of novobiocin (25 Î¼g/ml)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
OmpR is a DNA binding protein belonging to the OmpR/EnvZ two component system. This system is known to sense changes in osmolarity in Escherichia coli. Recently,  OmpR in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was found to be activated by acidic pH and DNA relaxation. In this study, ChIP-on-chip was employed to ascertain the genome-wide distribution of OmpR in Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli in acidic and neutral pH. In addition we investigated the affect of DNA relaxation on OmpR binding in Salmonella Typhimurium.
