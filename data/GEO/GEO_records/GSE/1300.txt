TITLE
Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to study differentially expressed genes in patients affected by Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) linked to mutations of the gene encoding spastin an ubiquitously expressed protein that has recently been shown to be involved in microtubule regulation and vesicle trafficking by cell culture studies. Gene profiling was done with Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChips using the total RNA extracted from muscle biopsies of 3 SPG4-linked HSP patients. Keywords: other
