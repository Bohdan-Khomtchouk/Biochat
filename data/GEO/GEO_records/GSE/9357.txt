SUMMARY
Early life stages are generally most sensitive to toxic effects. Our knowledge on the action of man-made chemicals on the developing vertebrate embryo is, however, rather limited. We exposed zebrafish embryos to 11 of environmental toxicants and measured the changes in gene expression profiles by microarray. Our results demonstrate that the genome of the zebrafish embryo responds to toxicant exposure in a highly sensitive and specific manner. Keywords: toxicants response genes expression profiles

DESIGN
Microarray analysis were performed, first, with 6 model toxicants, such as, 4-chloroaniline, Cadmium, Methyl mercury, DDT, TCDD, and Valproic acid, to compare gene expression patterns at exposure embryos from 4 to 24 hpf, from 24 to 48 hpf, and from 96 to 120hpf; Second, with added 5 model toxicants, including Acrylamide, Arsenic, Lead, PCB, and t-BHQ, to compare total 11 toxicants gene expression profile at exposure embryos from 96 to 120 hpf; Third, with different toxicants concentration to compare response gene profiles at 96 to 120 hpf; Fourth, with four toxicants mixture, including Cadmium, Mercury, Lead, and Arsenic to compare the chemicals synergistic effects. Last, we did the blind testing to figure out different toxicants according response gene profiles.
