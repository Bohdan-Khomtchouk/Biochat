TITLE
Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs regulated by SERRATE, CBP20 and CBP80

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) transcribed from intergenic regions play important roles in key biological processes.Analysis of published transcriptom datasets suggested some lincRNAs may be regulated by SERRATE,CBP20 and CBP80 in Arabidopsis. To further investigate the regulation, we use Arabidopsis lincRNA arrays v1 to detect lincRNA expression in se-2 and cbp20/80 double mutants.We found the expression levels of 940 lincRNAs (20%) out of the 4,634 lincRNAs with probes in array were significantly alerted in all mutants (P-value of eBays ANOVA < 0.05 & fold change of signal intensity > 2). This group included 525 up-regulated and 415 down-regulated lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Seedlings(Col-0), Seedlings(se-2), Seedlings(cbp20,80 double mutant) x 3 biological replicates
