TITLE
In vivo T-box Transcription Factor Profiling Reveals Joint Regulation of Embryonic Neuro-mesodermal Bipotency.

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
We defined genome-wide regulatory inputs of the T-box transcription factors Brachyury (Xbra), Eomesodermin (Eomes) and VegT that maintain neuro-mesodermal stem cells and determine their bipotential fates in the Xenopus tropicalis frog embryo.

DESIGN
Binding profiles for Xbra, Eomes and VegT in X. tropicalis embryos (ChIP-Seq)
