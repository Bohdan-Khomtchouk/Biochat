TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and IFC （incompletely fused carpels） Maize Ovary Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to investigate transcriptional networks that are likely to regulate IFC ovaries and to better understand the molecular framework associated with carpel fusion in maize.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different transcriptome changes in 2 ovary phenotypes. Expression values obtained for the 25,368 genes expressed in at least one of the 2 sequenced samples.

PLATFORM
GPL17628 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Zea mays)
