TITLE
Identification of a gene cluster involved in the utilization of phenylpropanoids in Corynebacterium glutamicum [set2]

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
DNA microarray experiments with phenylpropanoid pulses were performed in order to get hints on expression of relevant genes or gene clusters activated in presence of phenylpropanoid compounds. We determined the relative mRNA-levels of wild-type cells confronted with phenylpropanoids and unpulsed cells. A pulsing time of 30 minutes was sufficient to find regulation of gene expression in response to the phenylpropanoid amount of 5 mM (final concentration) added. A relatively short pulsing time was preferred over the cultivation of the strain with phenylpropanoids in comparison to growth on glucose because a completely different growth behavior was expected when using two completely unrelated carbon sources.
