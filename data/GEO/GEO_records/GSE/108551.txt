TITLE
Cardiac microarray changes in a transgenic mouse expressing a human mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A TET-On transgenic mouse model was develop for cardiac expression of a human mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M). Expression was verified by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Previous research with cell knockdown and overexpression has shown a ligand dependent increase in cellular respiration with this receptor. Mice expressing (N=3) or not expressing (N=3) PR-M were treated with progesterone for 19-21 days prior to sacrifice. Tissue from the apical cardiac ventrical was submitted for microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from the cardiac ventricular apex was used for hyridization on a Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
