TITLE
Epigenome analysis of aging muscle progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of muscle cells extracted from healthy donors at different ages. The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across > 485,000 methylation sites.  The muscle cells were extracted from young adults (18-40 years old) and elderly ( > 70 years old)(n=3 per group, 2 groups : Young and aged adult).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 6 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
