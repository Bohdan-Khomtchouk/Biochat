TITLE
Rat exposure to RDX (3mg/kg or 18mg/kg; 0, 4, 24, 48 hr)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RDX (Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) is a synthetic, high-impact, relatively stable explosive that has been in use since WWII.   Exposure to RDX can occur either occupationally or through ordnance that lays unexploded on training ranges.  The toxicology of RDX is dominated by acute tonic-clonic seizures at high doses, which remit when exposure is removed and internal RDX levels decrease.  Sub-chronic studies have revealed few other toxic effects.  The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a single oral dose of RDX on global gene expression in the mammalian brain and liver, using a rodent model. Keywords: time course, dose response

DESIGN
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single, oral, non-seizure inducing dose of either 3 or 18 mg/kg RDX in a gel capsule.  Rats were euthanized at times 0, 4, 24, and 48 hours. RNA purified from brain cortex or liver was hybridized to Affymetrix rat 230.2 arrays.
