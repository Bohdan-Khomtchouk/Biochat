Gene expression data from human NSCLC cell line (U-1810 cells) treated with miRNA-214 antagomir or non-targeting antagomir

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prognosis of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is very poor mainly because it often has metastasized to distant organs already at the time of diagnosis. Therefore biomarkers which can predict metastasis are urgently needed. miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of different tumor cell processes including those involved in metastasis. We recently showed that miRNA-214 is linked to a radioresistant phenotype of NSCLC. Interestingly, altered miRNA-214 expression has in breast, cervical and melanoma been linked to metastasis. We therefore examined the role of miRNA-214 in the metastasis of NSCLC cells. We found that down regulation of miRNA-214 increased invasive potential of NSCLC cells and conversely, overexpression of miRNA-214 in NSCLC cells with low endogenous level of miRNA-214, decreased invasiveness. Gene expression analyses of NSCLC cells with low and high levels of miRNA-214, followed by bioinformatics analyses identified a number of target genes which were linked to metastasis including pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), alpha protein kinase 2 (ALPK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and tumor necrosis-factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3). These targets were validated on mRNA and protein level.

DESIGN
U-1810 cells with high endogenous level of miRNA-214 were treated with miRNA-214 antagomir (3 biological replicates) or non-targeting antagomir (3 biological replicates) and then RNA was extracted and applied to Affymetrix gene array platform.
