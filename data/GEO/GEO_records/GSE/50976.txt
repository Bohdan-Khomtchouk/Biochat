TITLE
Nascent strand with BrdU or lambda exonuclease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nascent strand were purified with either the  BrdU or the  lambda exonuclease methods from culture human basophilic erythroblasts and sequenced/

DESIGN
Two methods were compared to isolated the Nascent strand, lambda exonuclease digestion or immunoprecipitation after pulse labelling with BrdU The following files were generated by combining round 1 and 2 sample files; FNY01_2_2_Ery_NS_BrdU_macs_summits.bed FNY01_2_2_Ery_NS_BrdU_macs_peaks.bed FNY01_2_2_Ery_NS_lexo_macs_peaks.bed FNY01_2_2_Ery_NS_lexo_macs_summits.bed
