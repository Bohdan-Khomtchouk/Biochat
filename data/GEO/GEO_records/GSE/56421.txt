TITLE
Corneal Gene Expression Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transplantation of amniotic membrane-expanded limbal epithelium (AMLE) in place of donor tissue grafts results in significantly improved outcomes for patients suffering from severe limbal stem cell deficiency; however the reasons for such superior results are unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify transcriptional gene profiles specific to AMLE and donor central corneal epithelium (CE), which may contribute to the divergent clinical outcomes observed following transplant. Limbal fibroblasts which underlie the epithelium and secrete extracellular matrix proteins following injury/surgery were also profiled. Using cell culture, immunofluorescence, microarray gene expression profiling and qRT-PCR validation; this study aims to identify enriched biological processes and pathways which characterise AMLE and CE tissues.  We hope the study outcomes will shed light onto the factors which contribute to provide the improved clinical outcomes associated with AMLE transplantation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of three central corneal buttons, three amniotic membrane-expanded limbal epithelial cultures and three limbal fibroblast cultures
