TITLE
SNP data from 30 pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP profiles from 30 pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas were analyzed to detect identical-by-descent haplotypes, highlighting a founder mutation of SDHD in two samples.

DESIGN
30 pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas were analyzed with Illumina Human610-Quad v1.0 BeadChips.
