TITLE
Brg1 Modulates Enhancer Activation and Polycomb-mediated Repression in Mesoderm Differentiation [ChIP-exo]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the genome-wide occupancy changes in normal and Brg1-deleted mesoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells of chromatin regulators and histone modifications.

DESIGN
ChIP exo for BRG1 in 2 conditions: Day4 THF (Control) and Day4 4OHT (Brg1-deleted).  1-2 replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
