TITLE
Evx1 is required to regulate appropriate anterior-posterior patterning during murine gastrulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated loss of function mESC clones by CRISPR-Cas9 to test the function of Evx1 during gastrulation. Evx1Δfs Clone 14 mESCs were differentiated to D4 in serum and compared to unedited mESCs

DESIGN
Three side by side differentiations (replicates) were performed and sequenced for both the Evx1Δfs Clone 14 mESCs and the WT mESCs. Each side by side differentiation was set up on a different day.

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
