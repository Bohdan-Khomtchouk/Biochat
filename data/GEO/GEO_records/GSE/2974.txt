TITLE
Downstream targets of let-60 Ras in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In Caenorhabditis elegans, let-60 Ras controls many cellular processes, such as differentiation of vulval epithelial cells, function of chemosensory neurons, and meiotic progression in the germ line. Although much is known about the let-60 Ras signaling pathway, relatively little is understood about the target genes induced by let-60 Ras signaling that carry out terminal effector functions leading to morphological change. We have used DNA microarrays to identify 708 genes that change expression in response to activated let-60 Ras. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
