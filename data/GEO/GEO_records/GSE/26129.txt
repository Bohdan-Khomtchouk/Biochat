TITLE
Alterations in tumour necrosis factor signaling pathways associated with cytotoxicity and resistance to taxanes in tumour cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The taxanes are widely used in the treatment of breast and other cancers.  While their cytotoxicity has been attributed to the induction of cell cycle arrest in mitosis through the stabilization of microtubules, we found that docetaxel promotes soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha production in MCF-7 breast tumor cells.  TNF-alpha induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types by binding to one of its receptors (TNFR1) which promotes death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation.  Consistent with this view, we also report that selection of MCF-7 cells for survival in increasing concentrations of paclitaxel or docetaxel results in selection of drug-resistant variants that are resistant to TNF-alpha cytotoxicity.  MCF-7 cells selected to 3-5 nM docetaxel produced > 30-fold more TNF-alpha than control MCF-7CC cells but had strongly reduced levels of TNFR1.  In contrast, expression of TNFR2 was unchanged, resulting in enhanced cell survival through the activation of the NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits.  Gene expression profiling of docetaxel resistant MCF-7 cells compared to parental MCF-7 cells was performed for the changes of TNF related genes, and also confirmed in ovarian cell line A2780.

DESIGN
Two docetaxel resistant cell lines of breast MCF-7 and ovarian A2780 were  generated for gene expression profilling. Two colour microarray of Agilent whole human genome nucleotide arrays was conducted with two replicate of both forward and reverse labellings for MCF-7. Four arrays were used for this experiments. And it was four replicate of both forward and reverse labellings for A2780 cells. Eight arrays were used for this experiments
