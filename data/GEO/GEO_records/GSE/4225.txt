TITLE
Sox4 knockdown in ACC3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sox4 is upregulated in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). The ACC3 cell line is the most widely available cell culture model system of this tumor type. RNAi mediated knockdown of Sox4 in ACC3 cells induces apoptosis. Since Sox4 is a transcription factor, it is hypothesized that this apoptotic phenotype is due to changes in transcription from genes under Sox4 control.This experiment was designed to find candidate genes whose expression levels change after Sox4 knockdown that could contribute to the pro-apoptotic phenotype. Keywords: gene knockdown

DESIGN
The ACC3 cell line was subjected to plasmid vector-based shRNA knockdown of the Sox4 gene, with a control group consisting of cells transfected with a plasmid vector expressing shRNA for the bacterial lacZ gene. Both groups were performed in triplicate.The shRNA sequences were expressed from the plasmid pENTR/U6 (Life Technologies Inc). Sox4 sequence: 5’-GACGACCTGCTCGACCTGAcgaaTCAGGTCGAGCAGGTCGTC-3’. RNA was harvested 48 hours after transfection.Labeled cRNA probe was hybridized to Affymetrix U133a probes.
