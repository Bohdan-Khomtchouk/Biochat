TITLE
Sox4 knockdown in ACC3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sox4 is upregulated in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). The ACC3 cell line is the most widely available cell culture model system of this tumor type. RNAi mediated knockdown of Sox4 in ACC3 cells induces apoptosis. Since Sox4 is a transcription factor, it is hypothesized that this apoptotic phenotype is due to changes in transcription from genes under Sox4 control.This experiment was designed to find candidate genes whose expression levels change after Sox4 knockdown that could contribute to the pro-apoptotic phenotype. Keywords: gene knockdown
