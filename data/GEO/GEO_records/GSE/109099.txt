TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of GM-CSF on the Transcriptomes of Alveolar and Exudative Lung Macrophages from Influenza-infected C57BL/6 Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptomes of FACS-sorted siglec-F+ alveolar macrophages and siglec-f- CD11b+ exudative macrophages from inducible airway GM-CSF over-expressing transgenic mice (DTGM) were compared to non-inducible littermate controls during influenza A virus infection.

DESIGN
Examination of effect of GM-CSF on airway macrophages during influenza A virus infection

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
