TITLE
Using natural variation Drosophila to discover previously unknown ER stress genes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To measure natural variation in ER stress transcriptional response in a subset of lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel

DESIGN
Transcriptional response to Tunicamycin and control conditions was measured at 8 hours of exposure (20 lines) and 20 hours of exposure (8 lines).
