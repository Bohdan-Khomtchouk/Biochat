TITLE
Selective increase in late sodium current leads to left ventricular fibrosis with ageing and both excessive hypertrophy and fibrosis with pressure overload in a knock-in murine model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
left ventricular transcriptional profile changes in a mouse model of Lqt3 Syndrome with age

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated left ventricular tissue of  Scn5adelta/+ mice (n=4 12 months of age) compared to wild-type littermates (n=4 12 months of age).

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
