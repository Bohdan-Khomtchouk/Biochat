TITLE
Determining the impact of alternative splicing events on transcriptome dynamics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background The complete sequencing of the human genome and its subsequent analysis revealed a predominant role for alternative splicing in the generation of proteome diversity. Splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) are a powerful and specific tool to experimentally control alternative splicing of endogenous messenger RNAs in living cells. SSOs also have therapeutic potential to treat diseases that are caused by aberrant splicing. The assignment of biological roles to alternative splicing events of currently unknown function promises to provide a largely untapped source of potential new therapeutic targets. Here we have developed a protocol that combines high sensitivity microarrays with the transfection of SSOs to monitor global changes in gene expression downstream of alternate, endogenous splice events. Findings When applied to a well-characterized splicing event in the Bcl-x gene, the application of high sensitivity microarrays revealed a link between the induction of the Bcl-xS isoform and the repression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Conclusions The strategy introduced herein provides a useful approach to define the biological impact of any given alternative splicing event on global gene expression patterns. Furthermore, our data provide the first link between Bcl-xS expression and the repression of ribosomal protein gene expression.
