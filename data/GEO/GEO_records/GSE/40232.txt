TITLE
Milbemycins: more than efflux inhibitors for fungal pathogens

ORGANISM
Candida albicans ; [Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
This study investigated the effect of milbemycons as efflux inhibitors and antifungal agents. Milbemycin oxims can inhibit growth of Candida glabrata and C. albicans. The effect of milbemycins on transcriptomes was inbvestigated.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in C. glabrata milbemycin-treated cells (1h) and compared to untreated cells in the incubation mediun RPMI.  The one-color system was used. Four biological replicates were used for each condition. Gene expression was measured in C. albicans milbemycin-treated cells (1h) and compared to untreated cells in the incubation mediun RPMI. The one-color system was used. Three biological replicates were used for each condition.
