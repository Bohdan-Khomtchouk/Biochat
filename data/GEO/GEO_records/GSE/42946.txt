TITLE
Adult mucous neck cells from corpus gastric epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment, mucous neck cells from the gastric epithelium of normal, adult C57/B6 mice were laser-capture microdissected to determine gene expression in neck cells relative to pit cells, parietal cells, and zymogenic cells, whose expression profiles were previously deposited in GEO.

DESIGN
In this screening experiment, only a single replicate Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip was generated from laser-capture microdissected cells in the neck region of the gastric unit (identified by positive staining with AlexaFluor-488-GS-II lectin positivity and/or position in the middle of the gastric unit with low labeling with E-cadherin and seconndary Alexafluor-488). RNA was purified by PicoPure kit, RNA integrity verified on Agilent Bioanalyzer, and total RNA pooled from multiple dissections and multiple mice to make ~100 ng RNA, which was then amplirifed, labeled, and fragmented (by Arctureus RiboAmp HS kit followed by the RNA Amplification and Labeling Kit from Enzo Life Sciences). Biotinylated cRNA probes were hybridized to the GeneChips. Given the inevitable contamination of the RNA with RNA from parietal cells, this GeneChip is used only in comparisons with laser-captured parietal cells described in GSE5018 as a baseline reference.
