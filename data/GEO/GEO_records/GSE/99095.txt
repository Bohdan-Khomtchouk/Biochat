TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals differentiation hierarchy of normal human bone marrow and a distinct transcriptome signature of aneuploid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to get a better understanding of the gene signature of aneuploid cells, we applied single cell RNA sequencing on human bone marrow cells from healthy donors and patients with bone marrow failure and cytogenetic abnormalities. We chacterized normal hemaopoiesis as binary differentiation and identified aneuploid cells from patient samples.

DESIGN
Single Cell RNA-seq The processed 'normalizedExpression.csv' file includes data for cells which pass the quality controls.
