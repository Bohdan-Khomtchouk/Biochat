TITLE
NQO1 regulates inflammatory signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NQO1 silencing by a specific shRNA against NQO1 increased migration and hormone-independent survival in hormone-dependent human prostate cancer cells LNCaP. Genome wide array revealed that NQO1 blockade significantly upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-32, CCL2, IL-8, IL-17C, IL-10RA, CXCR2, CXCR7, NOS3) associated with prostate tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. NQO1 knockdown LNCaP cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 NQO1 knockdown replicates.

PLATFORM
