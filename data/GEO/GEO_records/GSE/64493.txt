TITLE
FCRL5 delineates functionally impaired memory B cells associated with malaria exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Classical and atypical memory B cells from Ugandan children were compared in their baseline gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Independent cryopreserved PBMC samples from children were thawed, and classical and atypical memory B cells were double sorted by FACS directly into an RNA lysis buffer. RNA was isolated, amplified using 2 rounds of linear amplification, and hybridized to Agilent-039494 Human 8x60k microarrays as a single color experiment.
