TITLE
Small RNAs expression of three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with different organ-tropism.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the small RNAs expression profiling of three HCC cell lines with different organ-tropism.The parent cell line has low mestastasis ability in nude mice model. Subclone 1 has higher metastasis ability specific to lung, and subclone 2 has dual metastasis ability to lung and celiac lymph node. We aimed to explore differentially expressed small RNAs involved in process of HCC metastasis and organ-specific metastasis, and identify their biological functions.

DESIGN
Examination of  different small RNAs expression among the 3 cell types.
