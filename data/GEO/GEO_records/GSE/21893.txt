TITLE
Expression data from an Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strains frequently cause extra-intestinal infections and are responsible for significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. APEC isolates are closely related to human extraintestinal pathogenic E.coli strains and may also act as pathogens for humans. In this work, three type VI secretion systems were deleted to analyze which pathogenicity characteristics would change in the mutants, compared to wild type strain (SEPT 362).

DESIGN
Four Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains (one wild type and three deleted mutants) were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle´s Media (DMEM) media until reach O.D 600 = 0.8, for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix microarrays.
