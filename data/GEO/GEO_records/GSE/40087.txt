TITLE
Expression data from Middle Ear Mucosal Metaplasia in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic Otitis Media (OM) develops after sustained inflammation and is characterized by secretory middle ear epithelial metaplasia and effusion, most frequently mucoid. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the most common acute OM pathogen, is known to activate inflammation and mucin expression in vitro and in animal models of OM. The goals of this study were to:  examine expression profiling epithelial effects of NTHi challenge in murine middle ears. We used microarrays to detail examine the global programme of gene expression underlying  epithelial effects of NTHi challenge in murine middle ears during this study.

DESIGN
Weekly transtympanic inoculation of Balb/c mice with 300 µg/ml of NTHi lysates vs saline was performed. Bacteria were grown on chocolate agar at 37ºC in 5% CO2 overnight and inoculated in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with 3.5 mg of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide per ml. After overnight incubation, bacteria were subcultured into 5 ml of fresh brain heart infusion (BHI) and upon reaching log phase growth, NTHi were washed and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by sonication for lysis. Three transtympanic inoculation of 6 Balb/c mice middle ears (3 animals, 6 ears) with 50 uL of 300 ug/ml of NTHi bacterial lysate and 6 Balb/c mice middle ears (3 animals, 6 ears) with 50 uL of 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were carried out weekly over 4 weeks (injection on days 7, 14, and 21). On day 28, the mice were euthanized and their bullae harvested. Expression microarray analysis was performed at 1 and 7 days.  Microarray findings were validated in independent animal samples and in a cultured murine middle ear epithelial cell (mMEEC) line.
