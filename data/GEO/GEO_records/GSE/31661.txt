TITLE
The expression profile under cooper sulfate treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The expression profile of natural isolate of S. cerevisiae carrying different copy of CUP2 were compared under cooper sulfate stress

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles of natural isolate of  S.cerevisiae(EC9-7), EC9-7 cup2∆ and  Ec9-7 cup2∆cup2∆ strains under YPD with 1mM copper sulfate for 1h and rich medium(YPD) were compared.
