TITLE
Human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) cell transcriptome response to infection with H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virus.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) serve as a model for resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in the human respiratory tract. mRNA-Seq analysis was used to profile the cellular transcriptome of MDM cells at multiple time points in response to infection with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus.  The Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo mutant virus is an attenuated H5N1 virus generated from wild-type Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus as described in Steel, J., et al. J Virol. 2009 Feb; 83(4):1742-53.

DESIGN
Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), obtained from healthy donor blood, were infected with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), or A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus. Infected samples and time-matched mock-infected samples were collected in duplicates at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hrs post infection for mRNA-Seq analysis.
