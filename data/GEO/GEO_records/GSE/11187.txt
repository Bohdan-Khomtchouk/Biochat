TITLE
Global consequences of phosphatidylcholine reduction in Bradyrhizobium japonicum

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
Analysis of a Bradyrhizobium japonicum pmtA mutant. PmtA catalyzes the first of three consecutive methylation reactions leading to phosphatidylcholine (PC) formation in B. japonicum. Disruption of the pmtA gene results in a significantly reduced PC content causing a defect in symbiosis with the soybean host. This study provides the first insight into global transcriptomic changes of a bacterial phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis mutant. Cells of the pmtA mutant and the wild type were grown to mid-exponential phase in full medium (PSY) under aerobic culture conditions. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Comparative analyis of the B. japonicum pmtA mutant and the wild type grown under aerobic culture conditions.
