TITLE
Retrotransposon Ty1 integration targets specifically positioned asymmetric nucleosomal DNA segments in tRNA hotspots

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using a TIP-seq protocol (specifically isolating transposon insertion junctions) we determined that the Ty1 retrotransposon targets tRNA genes and, in particular, we determined that the transposon inserts into nucleosomal DNA in an asymmetric pattern.

DESIGN
TIP-seq recovery of transposon insertion junctions in haploid and diploid yeast
