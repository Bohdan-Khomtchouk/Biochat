TITLE
Global gene expression profile of hIAPP-Tg mice, BACE2-KO mice and hIAPP-TgxBACE2-KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
12 weeks old wild type, hIAPP transgenic,  BACE2 deficient and both overexpressing hIAPP and lacking BACE2 mice were taken for the study. Pancreatic islets were isolated at sacrifice. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We used microarrays to determine gene expression changes in pancreatic islets from mice overexepressing hIAPP, mice with a functional deletion in BACE2, mice with both of these modifications and wild type mice.
