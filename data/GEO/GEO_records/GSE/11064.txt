TITLE
AdHBx UV vs AdEasy UV vs HepG2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HepG2 cells treated with UVC (254 nm) for 30 seconds and transduced with Adenoviral vector carrying the Hepatitis B Virus HBx gene vs Adenoviral vector control  under UV treatment Keywords: Over-expression

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, AdHBx (experimental) UV vs AdEasy (vector control) UV.  HepG2 cells were infected with either recombinant HBx adenoviruses (AdHBx) or control adenoviruses (AdEasy). Seventy-two hours later, infected cells were exposed for 30 seconds to UVC (254 nm) irradiation with a germicidal lamp calibrated to deliver 8 or 16 J/m2.  Cells were then harvested for either ChIP-chip profiling or expression microarray profiling
