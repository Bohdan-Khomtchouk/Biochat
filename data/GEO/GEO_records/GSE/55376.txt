TITLE
small RNAseq analysis of the global retinal transcriptome of rod photoreceptor-specific Dicer1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNAseq analysis of the transcriptome of retinas from mature rod-specific Dicer1 cKO mice and control littermates lacking Cre expression in order to better understand changes in gene regulation that could lead to retinal degeneration in cKO mice.

DESIGN
Examine retinal transcriptome of 3 biological replicates for each genotype from 4-week-old animals with tissue collected between 8:00 - 10:00AM

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
