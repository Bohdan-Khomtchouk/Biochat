TITLE
A gene expression microarray for Nicotiana benthamiana based on de novo transcriptome sequence assembly

ORGANISM
Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray was designed, based on two recently published versions of the N. benthamiana transcriptome (v.3 and v.5). Based on homology searches and hybridization tests we identified the sense strand in 106,684 transcriptome contigs and used this information to design a Nb-105k microarray on Agilent eArray platform. By the hybridization of N. benthamiana roots vs leaves RNA samples we showed high specificity and sensitivity of the new microarray in detection of differentially expressed transcripts.

DESIGN
Agilent microarrays in 2x105k format (two microarrays per slide) were used  for hybridization of labeled RNA from leaves vs roots of N. benthamiana plants. Four biological replicates were used for two-color design in a dye-swap manner.
