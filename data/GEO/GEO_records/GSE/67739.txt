TITLE
Identification of differential expressed genes among reprogrammed cells cultured under control condition and calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibition condition at reprogramming day 3 and day 6 through genome-wide transcript profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT pathway at the early stage can block somatic cell reprogramming. In order to study how the calcineurin-NFAT pathway contributes to the early stage of reprogramming, we designed this microarray experiment and tried to find out which genes or signalings were changed after inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling by CSA (a specific inhibitor of calcineurin-NFAT pathway).

DESIGN
We tried to compare gene profiling of different reprogrammed cells treated with DMSO and CSA (10 mM) at reprogramming day 3 and day 6 in our OSKM secondary reprogramming system.Each group had two independant biological repeats .
