TITLE
Impact of Tcf1 and Lef1 deficiency on mSin3A distribution in CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mSin3A distribution between control and Tcf1/Lef1-deficient CD8 T cells

DESIGN
Control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors (deleted by CD4-Cre) were used to isolate splenocytes. The splenocytes were surface-stained to identify TCRbeta high CD8+ subsets. These cells were sorted for ChIPseq analysis.
