TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the ileum following vertical sleeve gastrectomy compared to pair-fed sham surgery controls in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the expression profiles of ileal samples extracted from obese male C57Bl6 mice following vertical sleeve gastrectomy or sham surgery, focusing of gene signatures indicative of altered bile acid metabolism.

DESIGN
We induced obesity in male C57bl6 mice through a high-fat diet.  At 8 weeks, they were submitted to either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) or a sham surgery; following surgery VSG mice were fed ad libitum while sham controls were pair-fed (SPF) to the experimental animals.  During the four perioperative days, mice were fed a liquid Osmolite diet. Approximately 8 weeks after surgery mice were fasted overnight and gavaged with .5mL Osmolite; after one hour mice were sacrificed and the terminal ileum were extracted.   RNA was extracted, quantified, and compared between VSG and SPF experimental groups.
