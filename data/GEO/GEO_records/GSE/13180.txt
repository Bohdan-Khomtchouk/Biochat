TITLE
Characterisation of Modular Reponse of non-pathogenic E.coli O157 Sakai Response to acid adaptation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. Sakai

SUMMARY
To study the dynamics of acid adaptation in E.coli at pH5.5 as opposed to that at pH7, samples were collected from a steady-state system for transcriptomics. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Single channel hybridisation were carried out using cy5 dye. Samples were collected from steady state system at pH7 and pH5.5 for 2.5h at 0min, 10min, 30min, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h

PLATFORM
GPL7535 UBEC Operon Array Ready E. coli Oligonucleotide set 1.0 [Oligo ID version]
