TITLE
miR-195-5p Regulates Hair Follicle Inductivity of Dermal Papilla Cells by Suppressing Wnt/Î²-catenin Activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis to detect the differential expression of miRNAs in early- vs. late-passage DP cells by microarray profiling of the total of 1924 hsa-miRNAs (miRNAs)

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the human scalp specimens were obtained from selected face-lift surgeries of healthy patients . We randomly select three dermal papilla cell strains to subculture and compare the differential expression of miRNAs in early- vs. late-passage DP cells by microarray analysis

PLATFORM
