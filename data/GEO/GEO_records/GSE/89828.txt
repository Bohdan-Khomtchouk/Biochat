TITLE
Human lung cancer Cells: Control vs. FENDRR stably over-expressed lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human lung cancer cell lines A549 comparing control cells transfected with an empty lentiviral expression vector pEZ-Lv201 and A549 cells transfected with a pEZ-Lv201-FENDRR. The latter forms a FENDRR stably over-expressed cell lines. Goal was to to assess the alteration of gene expression profiles caused by FENDRR upregulation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, A549 vs. FENDRR stably over-expressed A549 cells. No replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
