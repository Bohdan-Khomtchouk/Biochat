TITLE
Identification of NO Response Network in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The goals of this project were: to use transcriptomics as a starting point for reverse engineering the NO response network of E. coli, and to identify the targets responsible for NO-induced bacteriostasis.  The data is associated with Hyduke DR*, Jarboe LR*, Tran LM, Chou KJY, Liao JC 2007 " Integrated network analysis identifies nitric oxide response networks and dihydroxyacid dehydratase as a crucial target in Escherichia coli. " Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104(20):8484-8489. Keywords: Comparative genomic response.
