TITLE
Tannic acid (20 µg/ mL) treatment effect on transcriptome of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 comparing culture treated with 20 µg/mL tannic acid against non-treated culture grown in Mueller-Hinton media

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, tannic acid (20 µg/ mL) treated culture versus non-treatment culture. 3 biological replicates including 3 technical replicates for one of the biological replicate and 2 technical replicates for another biological replicate. Swap-dye experiments were performed
