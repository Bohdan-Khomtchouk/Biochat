TITLE
Human Beta-Defensin 3 attenuates the pro-inflammatory effects of KDO2-Lipid A (KLA) at 6 hour

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the global effect of hBD3 on transcription in TLR4-stimulated macrophages and for the first time show that hBD3 inhibits the transcription of critical pro-inflammatory genes. Among the repressed genes we detect significant enrichment of groups involved in the positive regulation of NFkappaB including components of Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) that have been subjected to 6 hour treatment with KLA, KLA & hBD3, hBD3 or untreated. There are 3 biological replicates per group.
