TITLE
Using DNA methylation profiling to evaluate biological age and longevity interventions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We utilized Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to profile DNA methylomes from whole blood of mice to develop a robust predictor of mouse biological aging. Based on DNA methylation profiles of mice from various ages, strains, genetic backgrounds, and diets, an aging methylation signature was observed and an epigenetic clock was created with elastic net linear regression. Profiles from fibroblasts and iPSCs showed that the aging clock can be reset.

DESIGN
Profile methylomes from whole blood of mice from various ages, strains, genetic treatments and diets as well as methylomes from fibroblasts and iPSCs.
