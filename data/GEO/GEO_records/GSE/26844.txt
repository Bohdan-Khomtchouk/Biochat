TITLE
wt vs. mutants 09-DNA methylation and small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs09-10_fwa - wt vs mutants 09. Impact of loss of DNA methylation and small interference RNAs (siRNAs) in gene expression. Determination of the genes misregulated upon ectopic expression of the FWA imprinted gene. Mutants impaired for the DNA methylation maintenance pathway and RNA interference machinery were compared to mutants simultaneously impaired for both. Impact of FWA and SDC ectopic expression.

DESIGN
15 dye-swaps. fwa-d, gain of function epimutation, gene knock-in (transgenic), gene knockout.

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
