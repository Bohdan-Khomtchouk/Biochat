TITLE
Med12 and p300 chips in HSPCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the genome wide occupancy of Med12 and p300 in mouse HSPCs. We also characterize p300 occupancy upon shRNA against control or Med12.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of Med12 and/or p300 in untreated HSPCs

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
