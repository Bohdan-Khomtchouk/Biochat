TITLE
Assessment and Diagnostic Relevance of Novel Serum Biomarkers for Early Decision of ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to determine blood transcriptome-based molecular signature of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and to identify novel serum biomarkers for early stage ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

DESIGN
We obtained peripheral blood from the patients with ACS who visited emergency department within 4 hours after the onset of chest pain: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, n=7), Non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI, n=10) and unstable angina (UA, n=9), and normal control (n=7)
