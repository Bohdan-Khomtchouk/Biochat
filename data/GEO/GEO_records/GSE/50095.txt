TITLE
Effects of Treg depletion in dystrophic muscle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) accumulate in skeletal muscle from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Analysis of global gene expression in muscles from mdx mice treated with anti-CD25 compared with muscles from mdx mice treated with control antibody revealed that Tregs partially protect mdx mice from muscle pathology and promote muscle repair/regeneration.

DESIGN
Mdx mice received 2 ip injections of 100 mg of anti-CD25 mAb (clone PC61) or rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) at days 17 and 20 of age. Muscles were dissected 7 days after the last injection.
