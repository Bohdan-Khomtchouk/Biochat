TITLE
Expression data of mouse fetal liver during embryonic day 18 and 19

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The oscillation status of the circadian clock during late gestation is not clear. To gain a better understanding on the oscillation state of the clock and possible influences by maternal cues, we performed transcriptome analyses on the fetal liver tissue during late gestation. Fetal liver transcriptome data were analyzed and compared to adult mouse data in the public database: GSE11923 and GSE13093 (only samples GSM327130 to GSM327141).  Re-analyzed (gc-RMA) data from GSE11923 and GSE13093 linked below as supplementary files.

DESIGN
Fetal mouse liver tissues were collected at four hours intervals across embryonic day 18 and day 19. Groups 1 and 2.
