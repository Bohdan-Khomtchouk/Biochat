TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of G protein-coupled receptors in distinct genetic subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia: identification of potential disease-specific targets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor clinical outcome and the development of more effective therapies is urgently needed. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent attractive therapeutic targets, accounting for approximately 30% of all targets of marketed drugs. Using next-generation sequencing, we studied the expression of 772 GPCRs in 148 genetically diverse AML specimens, normal blood and bone marrow cell populations as well as cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells. Among these receptors, 30 are overexpressed and 19 are downregulated in AML samples compared with normal CD34-positive cells. Upregulated GPCRs are enriched in chemokine (CCR1, CXCR4, CCR2, CX3CR1, CCR7 and CCRL2), adhesion (CD97, EMR1, EMR2 and GPR114) and purine (including P2RY2 and P2RY13) receptor subfamilies. The downregulated receptors include adhesion GPCRs, such as LPHN1, GPR125, GPR56, CELSR3 and GPR126, protease-activated receptors (F2R and F2RL1) and the Frizzled family receptors SMO and FZD6. Interestingly, specific deregulation was observed in genetically distinct subgroups of AML, thereby identifying different potential therapeutic targets in these frequent AML subgroups.

DESIGN
Total healthy bone marrow was sorted to isolate distinct cell populations. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on sorted cells to determine gene expression profile of healthy bona marrow subpopulations.
