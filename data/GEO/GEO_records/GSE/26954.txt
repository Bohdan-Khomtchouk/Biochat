TITLE
Comprehensive Long Span Paired-End-Tag Mapping Reveals Characteristic Patterns of Structural Variations in Epithelial Cancer Genomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Somatic genome rearrangements are thought to play important roles in cancer development. We optimized a long span paired-end-tag (PET) sequencing approach using 10 Kb genomic DNA inserts to study human genome structural variations (SVs). The use of 10 Kb insert size allows the identification of breakpoints within repetitive or homology containing regions of a few Kb in size and results in a higher physical coverage compared to small insert libraries with the same sequencing effort. We have applied this approach to comprehensively characterize the SVs of 15 cancer and 2 non-cancer genomes and used a filtering approach to strongly enrich for somatic SVs in the cancer genomes. Our analyses revealed that most inversions, deletions, and insertions are germline SVs, whereas tandem duplications, unpaired inversions, inter-chromosomal translocations, and complex rearrangements are overrepresented among somatic rearrangements in cancer genomes. We demonstrate that the quantitative and connective nature of DNA-PET data is precise in delineating the genealogy of complex rearrangement events, we observe signatures which are compatible with breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, and discover that large duplications are among the initial rearrangements that trigger genome instability for extensive amplification in epithelial cancers.
