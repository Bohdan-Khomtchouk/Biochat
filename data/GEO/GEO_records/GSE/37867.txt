TITLE
Overexpression of ENOD40 in Arabidopsis thaliana plants reveals a role of the gene in cell wall turnover and glucosinolate accumulation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcriptional and metabolic profiles of rosettes of three independent Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Wassiliewska lines overexpressing the soybean early noduline GmENOD40 gene were compared to those of wt, and a biomarker analysis was performed. ENOD40 overexpression resulted in 382 modulated genes, 142 of which upregulated and 165 downregulated in all the three transformed lines. Cell wall, membrane, hydrolase activity on glycosidic bonds, defense response and response to stimulus gene categories were overrepresented in the modulated genes compared to TAIR complete database. Metabolomics analysis (through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) allowed to putatively identify 13 different glucosinolates, some flavonoids, sinapic and ferulic acid derivatives, hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, non aromatic organic acids, amino acids. Positive genes biomarkers of the transformed plants were mainly involved in cell wall turnover, whereas positive metabolite biomarkers were the methylthioalkyl-glucosinolates.
