TITLE
Murine Bone Marrow Macrophages: Control vs. RANKL Stimulated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the microRNAs that are involved in osteoclastogenesis, microRNA expression profiles in mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) stimulated with RANKL (BMOc) were compared with that of control untreated BMMs. These results provide insights into the mechanisms to regulate osteoclastogenesis and  bone resorption activities in osteoclasts by microRNA.

DESIGN
BMMs were cultured with 20 ng/ml M-CSF in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml RANKL for 24 hours. Cells were collected for total RNA isolation, and were subjected to microRNA array analysis.
