TITLE
SAS cells: control siRNA (siC) vs DDX3 siRNA (siD) transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of SAS cells comparing siC-transfected SAS cells with siD-transfected SAS cells. The latter decreased proliferation and migration of SAS cells. Goal was to determine the DDX3-regulated transcripts.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, siC-transfected SAS vs. siD-transfected cells. Biological replicates: 2 siC replicates, 2 siD replicates.
