TITLE
Transcriptional expression level during exponential growth phase in Kluyveromyces marxianus

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces marxianus

SUMMARY
To understand functional roles of ncRNAs during exponential growth phase, we captured transcriptome changes by conducting strand-specific RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Directional RNA-seq (dUTP method by TruSeqÂ®) were generated  in two biological replicates by using Illumina MiSeq
