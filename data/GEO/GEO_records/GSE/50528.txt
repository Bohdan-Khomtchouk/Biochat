TITLE
A. borkumensis cells: pyruvate vs. cells grown on hexadecane, canola and diesel

ORGANISM
Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Alcanivorax borkumensis cells, grown on either pyruvate or hexadecane, canola and diesel as carbon source.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, cells grown on pyruvate vs. cells grown on hexadecane, canola or diesel. For each condition 4 replicates were used, as for the control condition also 4 replicates were used for analysis.

PLATFORM
