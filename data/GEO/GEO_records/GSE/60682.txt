TITLE
Individuality and variation of personal regulomes in human T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed the variation and dynamics of active regulatory elements genome-wide in CD4+ T cells, using Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) in longitudinal samples from healthy volunteers and during T cell activation. We created robust pipelines that enable accurate single molecule counting and allelic discrimination from clinical material. Over 4000 regulatory elements (7.2%) showed reproducible personal variation in activity. Gender was the most significant attributable source of regulome variation. ATAC-seq revealed novel elements that escape X chromosome inactivation and predicted gender-specific gene regulatory networks across autosomes, which coordinately impact genes with immune function. Noisy regulatory elements with personal variation in accessibility are significantly enriched for autoimmune disease loci. Over one third of regulome variation lacked genetic variation in cis, suggesting contributions from environmental or epigenetic factors. These results refine concepts of human individuality and provide foundational reference to compare disease-associated regulomes.

DESIGN
We examined chromatin structure using ATAC-seq in purified human CD4+ T cells in 33 samples from 12 healthy donors and 15 samples from 3 patients with cutaneous T cell leukemia (CTCL). For T cell activation (TCA) time course, CD4+ cells from healthy donor 1 isolated as above were stimulated with ionomycin (1 ug/mL) and Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA; 20 ng/mL) and collected at 0, 1, 2, 4 hours in duplicate.
