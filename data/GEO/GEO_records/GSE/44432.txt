TITLE
Transcriptomics profilling of B. anthracis grown under different environmental perturbation

ORGANISM
Bacillus anthracis

SUMMARY
The effect of factors that affect toxin production i.e. glucose, bicarbonate and growth temperature was investigated by transcriptional profilling using microarrays.

DESIGN
Sequential environmental perturbations were carried out in R media, wherein glucose was replaced by glycerol (0.25%) [referred as 'R(-)Glucose'] or no bicarbonate [referred as 'R(-)Bicarbonate'] was added or the growth temperature was 28°C instead of 37°C [referred as 'R-28C']. The strain was grown in a chemically defined media called R medium in the presence of 5%CO2 at 37°C to simulate host like conditions and induce toxin production (referred as ‘R-Full’), which is used as control in this study.
