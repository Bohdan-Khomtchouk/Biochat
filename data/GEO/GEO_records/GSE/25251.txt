TITLE
Establishment and Comparative Characterization of Novel Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Lines and Their Corresponding Tumor Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines play an important role for studying tumor biology and novel therapeutic agents. We demonstrated that cell lines represent a useful and reliable in vitro system for studying basic mechanisms in lung cancer. Moreover, we presented 3 novel, comprehensively characterized SCC cell lines.

DESIGN
