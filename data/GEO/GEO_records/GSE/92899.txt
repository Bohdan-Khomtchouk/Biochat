TITLE
Distinct Sets Of Genes Representing Overlapping Biological Functions Are Altered By Intrinsic Properties Of Carbon Nanomaterials In Vitro And In Vivo [human]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Six different carbon nanomaterials (CNM) administered by oropharyngeal aspiration to C57BL/6 mice (on 4 consecutive days with 10ug of CNM per day in PBS, sacrificed on 5th day)  and to differentiated THP-1 cells in culture (6 hour and 24 hour, with 100ug of CNM /ml of medium)

DESIGN
THP-1 cells were grown in 30 ml of RPMI 1640 media, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PEST) antibiotics and 2mM Ultraglutamine. THP-1 cells were differentiated with 50nm PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) and exposed in six-well plates to six different carbon nanomaterials (CNM) by replacing the old media and adding 100 Âµg of the CNM in 1 ml of fresh complete RPMI and incubated for 6 or 24 hours
