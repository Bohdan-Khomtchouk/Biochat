SNP array data for 304 pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number and LOH analysis was performed for 304 casesof B-progenitor and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All caseswere genotyped with Affymetrix 250k Sty and Nsp arrays. 252 cases werealso genotyped with Hind and Xba arrays. Keywords: Acute leukemia, BCR-ABL1, copy number analysis, loss-of-heterozygosity, genomics *** Due to privacy concerns, the primary SNP array data is no longer available with unrestricted access.
