TITLE
Methylation profiling in predict recurrence hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA methylation value in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma was undetermined. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to identify recurrence-related abbrent CpG methylation.

DESIGN
This study was performed in a total of 66 early-stage HCC samples, including 29 recurrence samples and 37 recurrence-free samples

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
