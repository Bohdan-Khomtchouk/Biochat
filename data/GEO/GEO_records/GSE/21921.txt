TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Familial Breast Tumours Using the Whole Genome-DASL Assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue sample acquisition is a limiting step in many studies. There are many thousands of formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival blocks collected around the world, but in contrast relatively few fresh frozen samples in tumor banks. Once samples are fixed in formalin the RNA is degraded and traditional methods for gene expression profiling are not suitable. In this study we have evaluated the whole genome DASL assay from Illumina to perform transcriptomic analysis from archived breast tumor tissue fixed in formalin paraffin embedded blocks. We profiled 76 familial breast tumors from cases carrying a BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutation, or from non-BRCA1/2 families. We found that replicate samples correlated well with each other (r2=0.9-0.98). In 12/15 cases, the matched formalin-fixed and frozen samples predicted the same tumor molecular subtypes with confidence. These results demonstrate that the whole genome DASL assay is a valuable tool to profile degraded RNA from archival FFPE material. This assay will enable transcriptomic analysis of a large number of archival samples that are stored in pathology archives around the globe and consequently will have the potential to improve our understanding and characterisation of many diseases.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from FFPE Familial breast tumours and analysed using the WG-DASL assay for Illumina.
