TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of HIV-infected peripheral blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immunologic dysfunction, mediated via monocyte activity, has been implicated in the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). We hypothesized that transcriptome changes in peripheral blood monocytes relate to neurocognitive functioning in HIV+ individuals, and that such alterations could be useful as biomarkers of worsening HAND. METHODS:  mRNA was isolated from the monocytes of 86 HIV+ adults and analyzed with the Illumina HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. Neurocognitive functioning, HAND diagnosis, and other clinical and virologic variables were determined.
