TITLE
Neutrophil and PBMC gene expression data from Job's Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyper IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome (HIES or Jobâ€™s syndrome), is a rare disorder of immunity and connective tissue, typically manifest with boils, cyst-forming pneumonias, and extremely elevated serum IgE as well as retained primary dentition and bone abnormalities. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant. In order to identify a specific defect or gene of interest, we performed microarray expression analysis on samples from patients with Job's syndrome and from healthy control subjects. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood from patients with Job's syndrome and healthy control subjects.  PMNs and PBMCs were incubated with or without IgG- and C3bi-coated latex beads for 3 and 6 hours.
