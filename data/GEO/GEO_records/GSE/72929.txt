TITLE
Deciphering H3K4me3 Broad Domains Associated With Gene Regulatory Networks and Conserved Epigenomic Landscapes in the Human Brain [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trimethylated histone H3-lysine 4 is primarily distributed in the form of sharp peaks, extending in neuronal chromatin on average only across 500-1500 base pairs mostly in close proximity to annotated transcription start sites. To explore whether H3K4me3 peaks could also extend across much broader domains, we undertook a detailed analysis of broadest domain cell-type specific H3K4me3 peaks in ChIP-seq datasets from sorted neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei in human, non-human primate and mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), and blood for comparison. In this GEO submission, we list six newly generated  ChIP-seq data sets.

DESIGN
FACS sorted Neuronal (NeuN+) nuclei and non-neuronal (NeuN-) nuclei collected from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and processed by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). In addition we collected nucleated blood cells from 3 control subjects. These are additional subjects unrelated to brain cohort.
