TITLE
Profiling of RWPE cells stably over-expressing ETV1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RWPE benign prostatic epithelial cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing ETV1 or GUS (control), and stable clones were isolated by puromycin selection. ETV1 over-expression, recapitulating ETS gene rearrangements observed in vivo, confers invasiveness in the benign prostate cell line RWPE. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Four hybridizations in total were performed using RWPE cells stably expressing ETV1 or GUS (control) on Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligonucleotide Microarrays. RWPE-ETV1 (Cy5) / RWPE-GUS (Cy3) and a dye flip were performed in duplicate

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
