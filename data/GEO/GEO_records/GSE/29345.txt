TITLE
Transcriptomics and metabolomics profiling in Flax stem tissues containing contrasted secondary cell wall architectures.

ORGANISM
Linum usitatissimum

SUMMARY
We used our previously described gene expression platform (Fenart et al., 2010) to assess gene expression along the stem of flax, both in inner and outer tissues.

DESIGN
32 chips study using total RNA from Internal and external part of Flax stem, sampled on whole stem or in different parts of the stem.
