TITLE
Gene expression profile upon miR-10b overexpression or knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-10b precusor or miR-10b inhibitor was used to overexpress or knockdown miR-10b expression in PANC-1 cells. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the changes in gene expression profiles of PANC-1 upon miR-10b overexpression or knockdown

DESIGN
PANC-1 cells were transfected with different microRNA oligos for 20 hr. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol method. Each expreimental condition had three biological triplicates.  Twelve samples were analyzed in total.

PLATFORM
