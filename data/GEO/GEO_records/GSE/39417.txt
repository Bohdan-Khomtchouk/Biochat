TITLE
Expression profile of the endocrine therapy sensitive breast cancer cells MCF7 depleted of PBX1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Effect of PBX1 silencing on global gene expression of MCF7 cells stimulated with EGF. The hypothesis tested was that PBX1 is essential for EGF signaling in ERa positive breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from MCF7 cells treated with siRNA directed at PBX1 or an siControl for 72h. Cells were then stimulated with estradiol (EGF) for 3h prior to RNA extraction.
