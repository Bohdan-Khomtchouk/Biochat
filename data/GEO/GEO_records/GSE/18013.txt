TITLE
miRNA expression data from rhesus macaque postnatal brain in prefrontal cortex: time course

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes determine functional differentiation during development and are associated with functional decline during aging. While developmental changes are tightly regulated, regulation of aging changes is not well established. To assess the regulatory basis of age-related changes and investigate the mechanism of regulatory transition between development and aging, we measured mRNA and microRNA expression patterns in brains of humans and rhesus macaques over the entire speciesâ€™ lifespan. We find that in both species, developmental and aging changes overlap in the course of lifetime with many changes found at the late age initiating in early childhood. Keywords: miRNA  Age Series Keywords: Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing

DESIGN
rhesus macaque post-mortem brain samples from the superior frontal gyrus region of the prefrontal cortex were collected. The age ranges of the indibiual in rhesus macaque covered the  whole life span fom newborn to death.
