TITLE
Investigation of miRNA expression signatures in mTORC1 -stimulated osteoarthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further explain pathology of mTORC1 -stimulated osteoarthritis, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify miRNAs which involved in development of mTORC1-stimulated osteoarthritis

DESIGN
We generated Col2a1-specific deletion of Tsc1 mice. mTORC1 induced miRNAs expression in development of osteoarthritis was measured at eight weeks after birth. Independent experiments were performed using knee joint cartilage from Col2a1Tsc1KO and control mice.

PLATFORM
GPL17912 Agilent-046065 Mouse_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
