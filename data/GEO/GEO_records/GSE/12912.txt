TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells by microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we profiled the change of gene expression by p53 knock-down on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cell line, KAT-18 cells using Applied Biosystem's Microarrays. When compared with the untreated control KAT-18 cells, 2,926 genes were found to have altered expression levels of 2-fold or more in cells treated with antisense p53 oligonucleotide. Microarray analysis revealed that p53 knock-down modified the expression of numerous apoptosis-related genes. Among those genes, 33 apoptosis pathway activators and 20 apoptosis pathway repressors were identified.

DESIGN
We analyzed human thyroid carcinoma cell (KAT18) on Applied Biosystem Human 1700 Chip Arrays. There were control and test sample, respectively, KAT18 untreated and treated antisense p53.
