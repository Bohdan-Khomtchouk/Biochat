TITLE
Expression data from Dicer knockout MEF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A functional part of the Dicer gene was knocked out from MEF using a conditional knockout strain Expression of miRNA target genes were evaluated to gain better understanding of regulation by miRNAs Keywords: Wild-type and knockout

DESIGN
MEF_CDKO+Tamoxifen (2 concentrations and 2 replicates each = 4 arrays) were compared to MEF_CDKO No Treatment / MEF_WT+Tamoxifen / MEF_WT No Treatment (2 replicates each = 6 arrays)

PLATFORM
