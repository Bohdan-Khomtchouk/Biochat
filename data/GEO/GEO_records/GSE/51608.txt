TITLE
Expression profiling of Ebf2- and Ebf2- stromal cells in mouse bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the true molecular features of the Ebf2+ cells, we performed microarray analysis of freshly sorted CD45-TER119-Ebf2+ and Ebf2- cells. This allowed for the detection of 1968 genes that were 2-fold differentially expressed in Ebf2+ and Ebf2- cells. Among these, 1075 genes were upregulated and 893 genes including Ebf2, were downregulated in the Ebf2- as compared to the Ebf2+ cells. These include Nov, Fmod, Ndn, Dcn, Ctgf, Angiopoietin like-1(Angptl1), Fn1 and Jag1, some of which has been reported to be expressed in culture-selected MSCs. Furthermore, consistent with antigen expression analysis by FACS, the Ebf2+ cells highly expressed transcripts of Pdgfra, Pdgfrb, Sca1/Ly6a, Thy1 and Itga7 and Itgav, that have been suggested to be linked to MSCs. Nestin was mainly expressed in the Ebf2+ cells whereas it was hardly detectable in the Ebf2- cells. Altogether, molecularly, the Ebf2+ cells displayed features of a MSC. Ebf2 expression is not restricted to committed osteoblast progenitor cells but rather marks a multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cell population in adult mouse BM. These cells do not appear to be completely overlapping with the previous reported MSC populations. The findings provide new insights into the in vivo cellular identity and molecular properties of BM mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 1,000 or 2000 purified adult bone marrow cells using the RNAeasy microkit. RNA was labeled and amplified by dual amplification and hybridized to Affymetrix microarray MOE430_2, according to AffymetrixTM GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Probe level expression values were calculated using the RMA algorithm.
