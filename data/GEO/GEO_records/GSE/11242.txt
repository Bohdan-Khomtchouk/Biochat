TITLE
2-Deoxyglucose induced transcription in control and MondoA knockdown cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the contibution of the transcription factor MondoA to 2-deoxyglucose-induced transcription expression analysis was carried out in control and MondoA knockdown cells HA1ER cells are human embryonic kidney cells transformed with hTERT, SV40 Early region and activated H-Ras Keywords: cell type comparision, genetic modification

DESIGN
HA1ER cells, Control (NS) or MondoA knockdown (M2), were starved for glucose overnight and then treated with 2-deoxyglucose for 3 hours
