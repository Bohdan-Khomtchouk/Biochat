TITLE
RNA profiling from prostate FFPE specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study feasibility of gene expression profiling from FFPE tissues using NuGen amplified mRNA hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays, we designed a pilot study utilizing samples from prostate cancer cohort. We selected samples from large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials representative of a wide variety of fixation times, block ages and block storage conditions.

DESIGN
We profiled seven paired tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissue samples from three patients with Gleason score 8, one with Gleason score 7 and three with Gleason 6 disease. 11 samples had two or three technical replicates.
