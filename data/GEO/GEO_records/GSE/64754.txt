TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of senescent cell-associated genes in adult mouse lung.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the senescent cell-dependent gene expression in aged lung tissue, young (2mo) ARF-DTR mice and adult (12mo) ARF-DTR mice treated with PBS or DT every two weeks up to 1 month were analyzed using the Agilent Technologies SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression Microarray.

DESIGN
Gene expression in lungs of ARF-DTR mice (2mo, 12mo, 12mo+DT) was analyzed. WT mice was used to evaluate the transgene-independent effect of DT on gene expression.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
