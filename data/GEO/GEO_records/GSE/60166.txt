TITLE
Wax and Wane of genome-wide DNA methylation during monkey preimplantation embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This study reports, for the first time, the genome scale methylome of nonhuman primate preimplantation development and proposes a perspective of DNA methylation dynamic equilibrium involving both DNA demethylation and de novoremethylation during primate early embryogenesis.

DESIGN
we collected rhesus monkey sperms and around 100 cells of MII-stage oocytes, zygotes, as well as 2 cell, 8 cell, morula stage embryos and inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocysts to perform single-base resolution whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). A previously described transposase-based library preparation method (T-WGBS) was applied.
