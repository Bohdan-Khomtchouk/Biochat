TITLE
Gene induction profile among wild-type, NF-IL6KO and KI(LAP) PECs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PECs from wild-type, NF-IL6KO and KI(LAP) mice were stimulated with or without LPS+IFN-gamma for 12h. We used microarrays to check the difference of gene induction among wild type, KO and KI mice. Keywords: Wild, KO and KI(LAP)
