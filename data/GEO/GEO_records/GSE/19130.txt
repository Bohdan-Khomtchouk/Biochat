TITLE
Renal allograft dysfunction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study comprises various components: We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in acute rejection on the kidney. We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in acute tubular necrosis on the kidney. We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in borderline change on the kidney. We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in non-rejection on the kidney. We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in presumed rejection on the kidney. We aim to screen out different gene expression profile in renal recipients with stable function. Results from the various study components can help to diagnose renal allograft dysfunction with different causes by distinct gene expression profile. Keywords: acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, borderline change, non-rejection, presumed rejection, renal recipients with stable function,
