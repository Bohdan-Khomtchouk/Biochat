TITLE
The age and genomic integrity of neurons after cortical stroke in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been unclear whether ischemic stroke induces neurogenesis or neuronal DNA-rearrangements in the human neocortex. We show here that neither is the case, using immunohistochemistry, transcriptome-, genome- and ploidy-analyses, and determination of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C-concentration in neuronal DNA. A large proportion of cortical neurons display DNA-fragmentation and DNA-repair short time after stroke, whereas neurons at chronic stages after stroke show DNA-integrity, demonstrating the relevance of an intact genome for survival.

DESIGN
Analyze of potential fusion transcripts in 13 samples, seven cortical ischemic stroke tissue and six control cortex, by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000
