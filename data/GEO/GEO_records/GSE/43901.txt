TITLE
Transcriptional changes associated with the fleshless (flb) somatic variation

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Genes regulated in the fleshless (flb ) somatic variant identified in grapevine cultivar Ugni Blanc.  Transcriptional changes were analyzed in the flb somatic variant compared to the wild type Ugni Blanc in flowers  (stages 18 according to the modified E-L system, ref: Coombe BG, Aust J Grape Wine Res 1995, 1: 104-110) and 8-day old berries.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Lucie Fernandez.

DESIGN
