TITLE
Murine Liver Cells: Control B6 males vs. little (GH-deficient) and Tfm (AR-null) males

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse whole liver comparing control WT B6 mice with B6 growth hormone-deficient little, B6 androgen receptor-null Tfm mice, and STAT5b KOs normalized to WT on B6 and BALB/c backgrounds. All animals were 10-week-old males initiated with DEN. Oberley et al. Molecular carcinogenesis 2014 May 17. doi: 10.1002/mc.22165.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, WT vs. little and Tfm livers. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 mutant replicates. Little and Tfm normalized to WTa, B6 STAT5b KO
