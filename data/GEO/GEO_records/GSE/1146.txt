TITLE
Sex-dependent and growth hormone (GH)-dependent gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A series of dual-channel gene expression profiles obtained using MWG Rat 5K microarrays (~5535 unique rat genes) and MWG Rat Liver microarrays (~1353 unique rat genes with 999 of these genes also represented on the Rat 5K microarray)  was used to examine the sex-dependent and GH-dependent differences in gene expression in adult rat liver.  This series is comprised of 8 randomly chosen pairings of independent male and female rat liver cDNA samples and 8 randomly chosen pairings of independent male and continuous GH-treated male rat liver cDNA samples, totaling 16 samples.  Half of the samples were hybridized to the MWG Rat 5K microarrays and the other half were hybridized to the MWG Rat Liver microarrays.  Comparison of the set of sex-dependent genes with the set of GH-responsive genes shows that 90% of male-dominant genes are suppressed in male rats treated with a female pattern of GH.  Approximately 73% of female-dominant genes were up-regulated in the continuous GH-treated male rats.
