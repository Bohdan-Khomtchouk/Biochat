TITLE
Expression data from mouse white adipose tissue lacking CNOT3, a core subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA degradation critically contributes to tissue development and function as well as transcription. The CCR4-NOT complex serves as a major deadenylase that initiates mRNA degradation. We used microarrays to identify deregulated genes in the white adipose tissues lacking CNOT3, a core subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex.

DESIGN
Adipose tissue-specific CNOT3 knockout mice were generated by expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Adiponectin promoter. White adipose tissues from control and CNOT3 knockout mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
