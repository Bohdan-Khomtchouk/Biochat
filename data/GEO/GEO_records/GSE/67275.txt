TITLE
lung metastasis 100% vs 0%

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung metastatic potential of the 29 HNSCC was examined with tail vein metastatic assay as described previously. 1 ×10E6 HNSCC cells in a volume of 200 µL were injected into the lateral tail vein using a 30 gauge needle. Eight to 10 mice were prepared for each cell line. Mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation when they lost more than 15% of their pre-injection body weight or at 90 days after cell injection. Necropsy was performed, and lung was harvested. The lungs were then evaluated for the presence of lung metastases and also weighed.

DESIGN
Lung metastatic potential of HNSCC was examined using experimental lung metastatic mouse models to study the detail of mechanism of distant metastasis of HNSCC.
