TITLE
The effect of fenofibrate on endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fenofibrate is a synthetic ligand for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, but there are reports that fenofibrate affects endothelial cells in PPARa-independent manner. In order to identify PPARa-dependently and PPARa-independently regulated transcripts we generated microarray data from human endothelial cells treated with fenofibrate with and without siRNA-mediated knock-down of PPARa.

DESIGN
In this study, we generated microarray data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with fenofibrate. Time 0 indicates the start point of observation immediately prior to exposure to the 25umol fenofibrate. There are five time points (2, 4, 6, 8, and 18hours) (n=3 at each time point). The control is untreatment HUVEC (n=4).
