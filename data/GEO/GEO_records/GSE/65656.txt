TITLE
Dietary and protein-restriction protect against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During kidney transplantation, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is inevitable and leads to oxidative stress and inflammation. We investigated the role of macronutrients in the effects of dietary restriction on both a phenotypical and transcriptional level, thereby comparing protective and nonprotective diets in search for pathways and regulators involved in the protection against IRI.

DESIGN
36 samples, each from individual mice Upon arrival, mice were allowed free ad libitum (AL) access to the SDS chow for 7 days. The fasting experiment was done separately, during which mice were randomly divided into a control group or 3 days of fasting. In a subsequent experiment, mice were randomly divided into the following groups: control group SDS or two weeks 30% dietary restriction, control type I, or  ad libitum access to  control type I, 3 days of a protein-free, fat-free or  carbohydrate-free diet. The SDS control diet is the standard chow given in our laboratory faculties. SDS is the control food for the fasting and dietary restriction groups. In these groups the composition of the diets does not change, but only the amount given. Control type I is a specific control diet for the diets lacking one  nutrient (carbohydrate, fat or protein). Because the food in these diets is changed in composition, the control type I diet is specially made to function as control diet for these groups.
