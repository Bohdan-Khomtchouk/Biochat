TITLE
Expression data SK-N-SH cells treated with risperidone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We  performed a pharmacotranscriptomic analysis of a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH) exposed to risperidone to identify molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular response to risperidone and thus identify candidate genes for pharmacogenetic studies. This study is a part of a convergent functional genomic approach that plans to integrate the data presented here with: data from gene expression analysis of experimental animal brain under treatment with risperidone; and data from gene expression analysis of peripheral blood from first psychotic patients treated with risperidone.

DESIGN
Gene expression was assessed by microarray (Human Genome U219 Array) in cells treated with risperidone 10 ÂµM at 6, 24 and 48 h

PLATFORM
GPL13667 [HG-U219] Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array
