TITLE
Whole mouse genome expression analysis of host responses in Citrobacter rodentium infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Profiling of a total of 34,790 genes revealed a wide range of expression changes during the course of C. rodentium infection in murine colon. The majority of changes were observed during weeks 1 and 2, while relatively fewer changes were seen at week 3. Interestingly, chemokines made up 20% of the top twenty upregulated genes.

DESIGN
Mouse colon from pooled control or C. rodentium-infected mice.
