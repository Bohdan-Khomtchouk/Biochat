TITLE
Gene expression profiles of detrusor, stroma and urothelium isolated from SMGA (Actg2) transgenic neonatal bladders using LCM. (GUDMAP Series ID: 20)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of compartmental bladder tissues collected through laser capture microscopy. Keywords: Gene expression comparison from developing regions of the mouse postnatal day 1 and postnatal day 2 urogenital system.

DESIGN
Bladders were isolated from newborn SMGA/EGFP transgenic mice, embedded in OCT, frozen and sectioned (8 microns).  Detrusor, stroma and urothelium were isloated using laser capture microscopy.   The caps were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 degrees C until RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis. Laser captured and total RNA isolated for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix MOE430 microarray chip.
