TITLE
Array-based miRNA Profiling of Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single stranded RNAs that are associated with gene regulation at the transcriptional and translational level. Changes in their expression were found in a variety of human cancers. Because of the lack of corresponding data in clear renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) we have performed genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs using microarray analysis and quantification of specific miRNAs by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. Matched malignant and non-malignant tissue samples from two independent 12 ccRCC sets were profiled. The microassay-based experiments identified 14 overexpressed and 20 downregultaed miRNAs in malignant samples. Expression in ccRCC tissue samples compared to matched non-malignant samples measured by RT-PCR was increased by 2.7 to 28fold for the hsa-mir-16, -452, -224, -155, and -210, but decreased by 6.2 to 96fold for hsa-mir-200b, -363, , -429, -200c, -514, and -141. No significant associations between these differentially expressed miRNAs and the clinico-pathological factors tumor stage, grade, and survival rate were found.  Nevertheless, malignant and non-malignant tissue could clearly be differentiated by their miRNA profile . A combination of miR-141 and miR-155 resulted in a 96% overall correct classification of samples. The presented differential miRNA pattern provides a solid basis for further validation including functional studies.

DESIGN
The study was performed with two independent sample sets. For each set 12 kidney tissue sample pairs were derived from adult patients undergoing radical nephrectomy at the University Hospital Charit√©. All tumor types were clear renal cell carcinoma. Tumor classification and stage were established according to the 2002 TNM System and the 2004 WHO Classification. Matched malignant (#NC (e.g. 2NC)) and non-malignant  (#NN (e.g. 1NN)) tissue samples from two independent 12 ccRCC sets were profiled.
