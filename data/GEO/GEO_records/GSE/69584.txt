TITLE
Target discrimination in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay requires Upf1 ATPase activity (CLIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA quality control pathways serve to get rid of faulty RNAs and therefore must be able to discriminate these RNAs from those that are normal. Here we present evidence that the ATPase cycle of SF1 Helicase Upf1 is required for mRNA discrimination during Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD). Mutations affecting the Upf1 ATPase cycle disrupt the mRNA selectivity of Upf1, leading to indiscriminate accumulation of NMD complexes on both NMD target and non-target mRNAs. In addition, two modulators of NMD - translation and termination codon-proximal poly(A) binding protein - depend on Upf1 ATPase to limit Upf1-non-target association. Preferential ATPase-dependent dissociation of Upf1 from non-target mRNAs in vitro suggests that selective release of Upf1 contributes to the ATPase-dependence of Upf1 target discrimination. Given the prevalence of helicases in RNA regulation, ATP hydrolysis may be an underappreciated, yet widely employed, activity in target RNA discrimination.
