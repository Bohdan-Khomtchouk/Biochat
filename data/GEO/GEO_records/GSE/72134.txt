TITLE
Dynamic and specificity of CUC transcription factors during leaf development : Towards a high-resolution Gene Regulatory Network model

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Define the regulatory network involved in leaf development 3-weeks old plants grown in short condition from each genotype (cuc2-3, WT and CUC2gm-4 lines) were dissected and meristem tissue and young leaf primordia were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA were extracted using miRVANA kit following manufacturers instructions. 3 biological repeats were performed for each genotype.

DESIGN
mRNA seq on wild-type Col0 and two CUC mutants knock out.

PLATFORM
GPL20696 Ion Torrent Proton (Arabidopsis thaliana)
