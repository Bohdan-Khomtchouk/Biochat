TITLE
MicroRNAs and Their Predicted TargetMessenger RNAs are Deregulated by Exposure to a Carcinogenic Dose of Comfrey in Rat Liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as regulators of gene expression to control cell growth and differentiation.  MiRNA levels are substantially altered in various types of tumors and have been used as biomarkers in defining malignant status.  However, studies on responses of miRNA expression to carcinogen insults in their target tissues are rare.  In this study, we analyzed miRNA expression in the livers of rats treated with carcinogenic dose of comfrey (Symphytum officinale), a rat botanical carcinogen.
