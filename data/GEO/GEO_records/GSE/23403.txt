TITLE
Loss of sarcolipin  results in atrial remodeling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of SERCA pump in atria. To determine the role of SLN in atrial Ca2+ homeostasis, we have generated a SLN null (sln-/-) mouse model. Ablation of SLN results in increased SR Ca2+ load and Ca2+ transients in atria. Further, loss of SLN results in electrophysiological and strcutural remodeling of atria.
