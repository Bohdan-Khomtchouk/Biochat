TITLE
Polycomb Cbx orthologs mediate the balance between Hematopoietic Stem Cell self-renewal and differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses we show that Cbx7 and Cbx8 share ~95% of their targets in bone marrow cells. Cbx7 and Cbx8 have only ~200 targets that are not overlapping between the two proteins. These distinct Cbx7 and Cbx8 targets show reciprocal expression patterns along hematopoietic differentiation.

DESIGN
Overexpression of empty vector (negative control), flag-Cbx7 and flag-Cbx8 in 5-FU treated bone marrow cells (progenitor and stem cells), followed by 1 week culture and subsequent ChIP using flag-M2 agarose beads.
