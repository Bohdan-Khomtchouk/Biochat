TITLE
Expression data from E16.5 mouse embryonic brain wild-type and knock-out conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse 16.5 embryonic brains using 3 wild type and 3 Tdp2Δ1-3 individuals. These data are used to obtain 165 genes that are differentially expressed as a consequence of Tdp2 absence.

DESIGN
The data (obtained from three independent pairs of wild type and TDP2D1-3 brains) was normalised using RMA (Robust Multi-Array Average) and genes changing 1.5 fold (corrected p-value cut-off:0.05) between Tdp2+/+ and Tdp2∆1-3
