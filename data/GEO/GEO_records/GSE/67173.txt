TITLE
A. baumannii Cells:  1/2MIC chloramphenicol (Cm) tretment vs. 1/2MIC 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA) treatment vs. 1/4MIC combination of  Cm and HBA treatment vs. Ethanol treatment

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC17978 cells comparing each treated 1/2MIC Cm, 1/2MIC HBA and combination of 1/4MIC Cm and HBA cells with same volume of ethanol treated. Based on the gene expression, we analyzed results to confirm the relation between Cm and HBA to antibacterial synergism against A. baumannii. (Concentrations treated respectivly in all samples were adjusted to add same volume of Cm, HBA and combination)

DESIGN
We performed a transcriptome anaylsis of 4 samples that are ethanol, Cm, HBA and combination treatment, respectively.
