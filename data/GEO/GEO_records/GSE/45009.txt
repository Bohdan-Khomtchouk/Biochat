TITLE
Expression data from Che-1 (AATF) depleted HCT 116 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Che-1 is a RNA Polymerase II binding protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription. Che-1 emerges as an important adaptor that connects transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle progression, checkpoint control, and apoptosis. We have observed that Che-1 depletion sensitizes cells to chemotherapy. We used microarrays analysis to investigate classes of genes regulated by Che-1.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from control and Che-1 depleted HCT 116 cells 48 hours after transient transfection of siRNA.
