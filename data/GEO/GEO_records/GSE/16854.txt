TITLE
Expression data from estradiol-treated fetal urogenital sinus mesenchyme cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developmental estrogen exposure causes permanent alterations to mouse prostate development.  Fetal prostatic mesenchyme cells regulate epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and alterations to mesenchymal regulation of prostate epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation may lead to permanent changes in gland structure and function.  Our goal was to understand how mesenchymal cells convert estrogen signaling to stimuli that affect epithelial cells. We used microarrays to identify estrogen-induced transcriptomal changes in primary cultures of fetal mouse prostate mesenchymal cells.

DESIGN
Urogenital sinus mesenchymal cells were obtained from CD-1 male mouse fetuses at gestation day 17 and cultured in the presence of 0.1 Î¼M estradiol .
