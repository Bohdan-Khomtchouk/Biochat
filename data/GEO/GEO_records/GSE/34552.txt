TITLE
Expression data from mouse kidney tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the renin-angiotensin system in chronic kidney disease involves multiple peptides and receptors. Exerting antipodal pathophysiological mechanisms, renin inhibition and AT1 antagonism ameliorate renal damage. This is a comparison between the renin inhibitor aliskiren with the At1 antagonist losartan in mice with chronic kidney disease due to renal ablation.

DESIGN
Renal tissue from ablated mice was used after 6-week treatment with either 500 mg/l losartan or 50 mg/kg aliskiren per day (n = 5)
