TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium marinum

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium bovis ; Mycobacterium marinum

SUMMARY
Related surrogate species are often used to study the molecular basis of pathogenicity of a pathogen on the basis of a shared set of biological features generally attributable to a shared core genome consisting of orthologous genes. An important and understudied aspect, however, is the extent to which regulatory features affecting the expression of such shared genes are present in both species. Here we report on an analysis of whole transcriptome maps for an important member of the TB complex Mycobacterium bovis and a closely related model organism for studying mycobacterial pathogenicity Mycobacterium marinum.
