TITLE
Somatic mutations in DROSHA and DICER1 impair microRNA biogenesis in Wilms tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through whole-exome sequencing we identified somatic missense mutations in DICER1 and DROSHA in Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer.  DICER1 and DROSHA are key enzymes in the microRNA biogenesis pathway.  To determine the effect of these mutations on microRNA expression, we prepared small RNAs from Wilms tumors and used next-generation sequencing to determine the expression levels of microRNAs in the tumors.

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression in tumors with and without mutations in DICER1 or DROSHA.
