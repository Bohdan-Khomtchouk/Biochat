TITLE
H3K27 Acetylation profile of hypothyroid NCoR1KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We ablated the expression of the Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 1 specifically in mice livers and rendered them hypothyroid. Then we performed H3K27 acetylation CHIP-Seq. We found decreased H3K27ac in the livers of hypothyroid wild type and NCoR1KO mice. Therefore, we concluded that the thyroid hormone receptor may recruit histone deacetilases independently of NCoR1.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27ac by Chip-Seq in euthyroid and hypothyroid Wt and NCoR1KO mouse
