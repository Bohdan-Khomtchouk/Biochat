TITLE
Whole blood microRNA expression in human lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seventh generation Exiqon locked nucleic acid miRCURY LNA microarrays were used to profile the expression of microRNAs in whole blood of patients with lung cancer and of clinically relevant controls without the disease (individuals with non-cancerous lung nodule, at high risk for cancer because of heavy smoking, or with lung cancer treated by surgical resection). The goal was to examine if whole blood microRNAs can be used for developing a non-invasive assay to diagnose lung cancer.
