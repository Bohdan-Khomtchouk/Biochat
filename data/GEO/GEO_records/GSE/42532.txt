TITLE
Expression data from leptin administration to Lepob/Lepob mice and  Lepmkyo/Lepmkyo rats

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Leptin-responsive genes in the pathway of a leptin signal from the hypothalamus to the liver has not been detected. We used microarray to detailed the expression of gene in liver in the status of leptin deficiency, and leptin administration. As leptin deficient status, we use  Lepmkyo/Lepmkyo rats or Lepob/Lepob mice and  their wild type littermates.

DESIGN
Recombinant murine leptin (1 microg/mg) and saline was intraperitonealy administrated in 20 weeks old Lepob/Lepob mice and their control littermates, and 20 weeks old Lepmkyo/Lepmkyo rats and their control littermates. In order to detect the early response genes whose expression level were changed before the food intake and body weight would change, we took liver samples 6 hours after administration.
