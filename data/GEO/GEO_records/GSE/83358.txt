TITLE
FOXP1-SHQ1 deletion cooperates with PTEN deletion in oncogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was carried out on prostate tumors from mice with prostate-conditional PTEN knockout with and without prostate-conditional FOXP1-SHQ1 locus deletion (12 month old PTEN-flox/flox Pb-Cre4 mice  and FOXP1-SHQ1-flox/flox PTEN-flox/flox Pb-Cre4 mice )

DESIGN
Frozen prostate tumors from 12 month old PTEN-flox/flox Pb-Cre4 mice (n=3) and FOXP1-SHQ1-flox/flox PTEN-flox/flox Pb-Cre4 mice  (n=3) were analyzed by RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
