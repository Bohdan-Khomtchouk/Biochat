TITLE
Genomics of Chronic Rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that T cell-mediated immune mechanisms play a role in two conditions; 1: donor-specific antibody (DSA) negative transplant glomerulopathy (TGP) and 2: interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) with inflammation (i > 0). We investigated gene expression profiles of those biopsies compared to biopsies with antibody-mediated rejection(ABMR) and to biopsies with non-specific IFTA and no inflammation. DSA negative TGP and IFTA with inflammation biopsies have a unique molecular signature distinct to that seen in biopsies with ABMR and IFTA without inflammation with significant expression of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells.

DESIGN
101 biopsies were studied using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST expression arrays; 16 with normal biopsy findings (G1), 33 with a diagnosis of chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR), 17 with chronic T-Cell mediated rejection and IFTA (TCMR_IFTA), 10 with T-Cell mediated rejection without DSA (TCMR_DSA-), 12 with pure IFTA (IFTA), and 13 with DSA and IFTA (DSA_IFTA).
