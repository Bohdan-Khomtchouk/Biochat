ORGANISM
Bacillus anthracis str. Sterne

SUMMARY
Subinhibitory concentrations of compound used to assess their influence on the gene expression profile of Bacillus anthracis.

DESIGN
Bacillus anthracis cells were treated with 0.25X MIC of compound (Me2-Arg-Az5, plantazolicin) for 10 min. RNA was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed using Rockhopper.
