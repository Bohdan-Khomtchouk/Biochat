TITLE
A transcriptional map following the developmental trajectory of the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Developmental transitions can be described in terms of morphology and individual genes expression patterns, but also in terms of global transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Most of the large-scale studies of such transitions, however, have only been possible in synchronized cell culture systems. Here we generate a cell type specific transcriptome of an adult stem-cell lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf using RNA sequencing and microarrays. RNA profiles of stomatal entry, commitment, and differentiating cells, as well as of mature stomata and the entire aerial epidermis give a comprehensive view of the developmental progression.
