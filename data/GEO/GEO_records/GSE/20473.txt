TITLE
LEOPARD Syndrome iPS, BJ iPS and Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from LEOPARD Syndrome-iPS clones, BJ-iPS cells and parental Fibroblasts

DESIGN
9 samples in total are analyzed. Among 22011 genes in expression data,  there are 3657 genes with at least 2 fold expression change between the average of the three fibroblast lines versus all of the iPS lines/HES samples. A heatmap can be generated for the expression levels for the 3657 genes and 9 samples.
