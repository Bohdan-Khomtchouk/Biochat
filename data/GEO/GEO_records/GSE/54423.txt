TITLE
Gene expression study of Drechslerella stenobrocha predating Caenorhabditis elegans.

ORGANISM
Drechslerella stenobrocha

SUMMARY
we studied the gene expression conditions while Drechslerella stenobrocha predates Caenorhabditis elegans. The perpose of this study is to find genes in Drechslerella stenobrocha participateing in predation.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 transcriptomes in different predation periods to find their different gene expression style.

PLATFORM
GPL18225 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drechslerella stenobrocha)
