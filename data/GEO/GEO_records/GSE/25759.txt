TITLE
Effect of downregulation of the high grain protein content (GPC) gene on the wheat transcriptome during monocarpic senescence

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
When GPC transcription factor in hexaploid wheat is down-regulated by stable RNA interference (GPC RNAi), senescence is significantly delayed and grain protein content together with the overall nutrient partitioning to the grain is greatly reduced. mRNA-seq was used to catalogue the genes that are regulated by the GPC transcription factor during monocarpic senescence.

DESIGN
cDNA was prepared from wild type bread wheat plants and GPC RNAi  plants 12 days after anthesis and sequenced by Illumina. Four biological replications per genotypes were sequenced. To determine gene expression levels, reads were aligned to a reference transcriptome generated by assemblying 454-reads obtained from the same biological material (454 assembled sequences: TSA project 59945 - accession numbers: HP608076-HP639668).
