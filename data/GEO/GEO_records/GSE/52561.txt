TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD4+ T-cell subsets in follicular lymphoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4+ T-cells from three follicular lymphoma tumors were sorted by flow cytometry into three subsets based on high (hi), intermediate (int), or low (lo) levels of PD-1 and CXCR5 expression and whole genome gene expression profiling was performed.

DESIGN
This set contains three samples for PD-1hiCXCR5hiCD4+ T cells, two samples for PD-1intCXCR5intCD4+ T cells, and three samples for PD-1loCXCR5loCD4+ T cells.
