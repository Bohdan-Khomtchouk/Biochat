TITLE
Intra-individual genome expression analysis reveals a specific molecular signature of psoriasis and eczema

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparing molecular signatures of psoriasis and eczema in patients co-affected by both diseases provides a comprehensive understanding of disease pathogenesis as well as a diagnostic tool to differentiate these widespread inflammatory skin diseases.

DESIGN
In patients affected by both psoriasis and non-atopic or atopic eczema simultaneously (n=24), whole genome expression arrays of psoriasis, eczema, and non-involved skin were performed Arrays MQ_35 and MQ_41 did not pass quality control and thus were not normalized and were excluded from this Series.
