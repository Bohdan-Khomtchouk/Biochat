TITLE
Parent-of-origin effects in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana: Agilent

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Crossing plants of the same species but different ploidies can have dramatic effects on seed growth, but little is known about the alterations to transcriptional programmes responsible for this. Parental genomic imbalance particularly affects proliferation of the endosperm, with an increased ratio of paternally to maternally contributed genomes (‘paternal excess’) associated with overproliferation, while maternal excess inhibits endosperm growth. One interpretation is that interploidy crosses disrupt the balance in the seed of active copies of parentally imprinted genes. This is supported by the observation that mutations in imprinted FIS-class genes of Arabidopsis thaliana share many features of the paternal excess phenotype. Here we investigated gene expression underlying parent-of-origin effects in Arabidopsis through transcriptional profiling of siliques generated by interploidy crosses and FIS-class mutants.

DESIGN
Six biological samples: 2xX2x, 2xX4x, 2xX6x, 6xX2x, 4xX2x and fis1X2x. Each non-2xX2x cross was co-hybridised with 2xX2x to a two-colour array (5 arrays). Dyes were then swapped and the hybridisations repeated using an additional 5 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL9964 Custom Arabidopsis 22K 60-mer oligo array
