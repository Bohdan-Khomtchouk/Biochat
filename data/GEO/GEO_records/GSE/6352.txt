TITLE
The activation of inflammatory response genes by LPS is blocked by HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TSA treatment blocks LPS-induction of several inflammatory target genes in primary macrophages. The microarray experiment was performed to identify LPS-inducible, LXR-sensitive target genes that retained LPS-induction in the presence of TSA. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated from  mice by peritoneal lavage 3 days following peritoneal injection of 2.5 ml 3% thioglycollate (DIFCO). Cells were plated in RPMI medium 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum, washed after 5 h the medium was removed and cells were fed with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with TSA (Wako) at 100nM and/or with LPS (Sigma) at concentration of 100 ng/ml in the absence or presence of receptor-specific agonist for LXR (GW3965) at 1 ÂµM. Keywords: TSA, LPS, LXR agonist
