TITLE
Gene expression data from myocardial infarction porcine samples

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The use of cDNA microarrays has made it possible to analyze expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. We employed microarray gene expression profiling of porcine cDNA to compare myocardial gene expression in infarct core and remote myocardium at 1 week (n=3), 4 weeks (n=3), and 6 weeks (n=3) after surgically induced myocardial infarction (MI) and in sham-operated controls (n=3). More than 8,000 cDNA sequences were identified in myocardium that showed differential expression in response to MI. Different temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression were recognized in the infarct core tissue within this large set of data. Microarray gene profiling revealed candidate genes, some of them described for the first time, which elucidate changes in biological processes at different stages after MI.

DESIGN
We evaluated temporal gene expression in a porcine model of myocardial infarction by microarray technology. Nine female pigs (Sus scrofa crossbreed Landrace x Large White) weighing 30-40 kg were subjected to experimental MI by a double-ligation of the first marginal branch of the circumflex artery. Animals were randomly sacrificed at 1 week (n=3), 4 weeks (n=3), or 6 weeks (n=3) after MI. Three paired myocardial samples from the infarct core and remote myocardium were analyzed at each time point. Myocardial samples from sham-operated animals (open-chest cardiac exposure without coronary artery ligation; n=3) were included as physiological controls.
