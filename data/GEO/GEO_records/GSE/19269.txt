TITLE
Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis_2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this project is to identify endogenous targets of yet unidentified epigenetic mutants. Mutants were discovered in a forward genetic approach using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis. Pools of 25 seedlings, grown in-vitro, will be used to examine changes in gene expression.

DESIGN
9 samples were used in this experiment.
