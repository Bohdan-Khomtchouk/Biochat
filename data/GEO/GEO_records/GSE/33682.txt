TITLE
Characterization of Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of HD-Zip HD20 (ir-hd20 plants).

ORGANISM
Nicotiana attenuata

SUMMARY
Identification of transcripts that change expression in corollas of Nicotiana attenuata plants with reduced expression of the transcription factor HD20.

DESIGN
Gene expression in opening corollas of Nicotiana attenuata wild type and ir-hd20 plants was measured from isolated corollas collected at 12 pm. Three independent experiments were performed with wild type plants and three independent experiments were performed with ir-hd20 plants. A total of 274 genes were identified as differentially regulated in ir-hd20 plants compared to wild type plants.
