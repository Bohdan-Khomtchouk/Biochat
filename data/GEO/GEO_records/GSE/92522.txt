TITLE
Transcriptional architecture of synaptic communication delineates cortical GABAergic neuron identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced six types of interneurons from adult mouse frontal cortex across multiple library batches to determine GABAergic neuronal identity

DESIGN
Cells were harvested from four animals and processed in batches of 16 cells each.

PLATFORM
