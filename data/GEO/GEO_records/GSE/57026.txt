TITLE
Ex vivo effects of Tenofovir on four vaginal epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In MTN-007, a phase 1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies taken at baseline, after one application or after seven daily applications (15 subjects/arm).  Experiments were repeated using primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women.

DESIGN
36 Arrays (3 primary vaginal epithelial cell lines from healthy women donors,  cultured with or without 50uM or 500 uM Tenofovir for 1,4,7, or 14 days per donor cell line.  A no treatment, culture media only control was included for each donor cell line and for each time point.
