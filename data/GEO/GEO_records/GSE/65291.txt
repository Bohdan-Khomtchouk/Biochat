TITLE
Gene expression alteration by different cell lines derived from lung SCC of IKKα mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we found that kinase-dead IKKα knockin (KAL) mice.  develop spontaneous lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) associated with IKKα downregulation and marked pulmonary inflammation.KKα downregulation dysregulates the expression of multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors in K5+ lung epithelial cells. The mutant macrophages increase inflammatory responses and oxidative stress to promote DNA damage in IKKα-mutant K5+ lung epithelial cells, which further dysregulate the levels of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and stem cell genes, thereby promoting the IKKαlowK5+p63hi cell transition to tumor cells in L-IkkαKA/KA lungs. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms by which the lung SCC development, we generated two cell lines, named as S1 and S2 individually, which were derived from KAL lung SCC. The S1 cells express high level of Sca1 and exhibit tumorigenic phenotype, while the S2 cells express low level of Sca1 and exhibit less tumorigenic phenotype. The aim of this microarray assay is to identify differentially expressed genes between S1 and S2 cells, which may highlight the important genes or pathways involved in inflammation-associated lung SCC carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
There were two cell lines were used to perform Gene chip assay with Affymetrix. The two cell lines, named as S1 and S2 individually, were derived from KAL lung SCC. The S1 cells express high level of Sca1 and exhibit tumorigenic phenotype, while the S2 cells express low level of Sca1 and exhibit less tumorigenic phenotype.
