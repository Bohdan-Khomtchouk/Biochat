TITLE
Transcription profiling of Density-dependent of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A and PXO99∆ax21

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A

SUMMARY
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99A, so called Xoo, is disable to infect in rice cultivar carrying Xa21 gene. A set of experiments indicated that Ax21 is quorum sensing factor in PXO99 strain. To observe fine-tuned details how Ax21 controls expression of PXO99 in response to change of cell population density, transcriptional profiling analysis was perform by using published two channel oligo Xo microarray platform (Seo et al.,2008 BMC microbiology). Keywords: Comparative transcription profiling between low cell density and high cell density with same genetic background

DESIGN
Three biological and dye-swap replicates, total six samples for each dataset. Two datasets contained; (i) PXO99 at 106 CFU/ml vs 108 CFU/ml, and (ii) PXO99∆ax21at 106 CFU/ml vs PXO99∆ax21 108 CFU/ml. 106 CFU/ml and 108 CFU/ml are cell density used in this study as representation of low and high cell density. All bacteria cultures were grown in PS (Peptone sucrose) broth media.
