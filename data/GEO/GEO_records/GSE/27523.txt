TITLE
Identification of hypoxia regulated HIF-1A and HIF-2A specific target genes in Glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIF-1A and HIF-2A regulate both overlapping and unique target genes in response to hypoxia. In this dataset, we identify specific HIF-1A and HIF-2A target genes in glioblastoma cells.
