TITLE
Identification of hypoxia regulated HIF-1A and HIF-2A specific target genes in Glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIF-1A and HIF-2A regulate both overlapping and unique target genes in response to hypoxia. In this dataset, we identify specific HIF-1A and HIF-2A target genes in glioblastoma cells.

DESIGN
12 samples were analysed comprising 4 experimental conditions (normoxia scr, hypoxia scr, hypoxia siHIF1, hypoxia siHIF2) in triplicate. We made pairwise comparisons between the averages of each triplicate set to normoxia scr using the Partek suite.
