TITLE
Identification of genes characteristic of primary inguinal or epididymal preadipocyte fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Committed preadipocyte fibroblasts were genetically labelled in transgenic mice by expressing GFP under the control of the locus for Zfp423, a gene controlling preadipocyte determination. These mice are herein referred to as Zfp423-GFP mice. The overall goal was to identify genes differentially expressed between adipogenic GFP+ firboblasts and non-adipogenic GFP- fibroblasts from either inguinal or epididymal fat stromal vascular cultures obtained from Zfp423-GFP mice.

DESIGN
Adipose stromal vascular cultures were obtained from inguinal or epididymal fat of 6-8 week-old male Zfp423-GFP mice.  GFP+ and GFP- fibroblasts were sorted from fat stromal vascular cultures and then returned to culture.  Subconfluent cultures of GFP+ and GFP- cells were compared in triplicate for Affymetrix analysis.
