TITLE
CTCF binding in B cells and Plasmablasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) regulates gene expression through the formation of higher order chromatin structures.  Recent evidence has implicated a role for CTCF in regulating gene expression in the human MHCII locus.  To investigate the role of CTCF in murine MHCII gene expression we mapped CTCF binding sites in B cells (MHCII+ cells) and Plasmablasts which are differentiated B cells that have silenced MHCII gene expression.  These observations lead to the identification of differential CTCF binding during differentiation in these cell types and suggest mechanims of MHCII gene regulation.

DESIGN
Comparison of CTCF binding in B cells and Plasmablasts in mice using ChIP-seq
