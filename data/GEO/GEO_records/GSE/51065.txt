TITLE
Proteomic and Genomic Analysis of transcription factor TFII-I reveals insight into the response to cellular stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We expressed biotin-tagged transcription factor TFII-I (GTF2I) in K562 cells and subjected crosslinked chromatin to streptavidin mediated pull down. We subjected the isolated DNA to Illumina sequencing.  We identified 18920 TFII-I binding peaks. Nearest gene analysis revealed 5886 genes associated with a TFII-I binding peak in proliferating K562 cells.

DESIGN
We generated two K562 single cell clones stably expressing bio-tagged TFII-I, and K562 cells expressing only the BirA protein biotin ligase from E.coli. These three clones were subjected to streptavidin mediated pull down and Illumina sequencing.
