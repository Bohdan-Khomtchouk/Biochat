TITLE
Expression data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumors and sorted CD19pos B cells from healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of a large study regarding the epigenetics of CLL we also acquired 3UTR expression arrays.

DESIGN
We have analysed the data to evaluate whether downregulated genes have higher entropy in DNA methylation
