ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of 5 IVF-derived bovine blastocysts using Illumina sequencing technology

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from individual D7  bovine blastocysts (Arcturus Picopure), cDNA was synthesized and amplified (Nugen Ovation) and indexed libraries were created for sequencing (Nugen Encore)
