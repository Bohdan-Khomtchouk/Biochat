SUMMARY
Summary: Astrocytomas can be categorized as either low grade or high grade (glioblastoma). Low grade astrocytomas are not generally aggressive tumors whereas glioblastomas are and in turn have a high mortality rate. The purpose of this experiment is to identify genetic differences between the two types. Hypothesis: There will be a difference in RNA expression between high grade and low grade tumors. Specific Aim: To identify genes which make a tumor high grade or low grade Keywords: disease, cancer grade
