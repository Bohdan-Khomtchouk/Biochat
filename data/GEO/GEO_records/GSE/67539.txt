TITLE
NeuroD2 ChIP-SEQ from embryonic cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NeuroD2 targets were identified from embryonic day 14.5 cerebral cortex tissue.

DESIGN
The cerebral cortex (dorsal telencelphalon) from E14.5 mouse embryos was dissected and ChIP-SEQ was performed using three separate antibodies against NeuroD2.
