TITLE
Comparison among longissimus dorsi muscle of 3 pig breeds, among developmental phases of Tibetan Pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify key genes associated with porcine muscle growth and adipose metabolism which different expression in porcine longissimus dorsi muscle tissue among Tibetan Pig, Taihu Pig and Landrace(Month 2), among developmental phases of Tibetan Pig (Month 2,4,6,8). The gene expression analyses will increase understanding of impact factors of pork quality by identifying key genes and pathways controlling longissimus dorsi muscle development. Relative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of 5 different expression genes(PPARGC1A, RYR1, IGF2, IGF1R and IGFBP5) which normalized by 3 housekeep genes(ACTB, TBP and TOP2B). Keywords: breed comparison and time course
