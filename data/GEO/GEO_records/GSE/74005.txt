TITLE
Discovery and Differential Expression of miRNAs in Fusarium Wilt Resistant and SusceptibleÂ Banana Varieties

ORGANISM
Musa acuminata AAA Group

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding small RNAs that regulate targeted mRNAs by degrading or repressing translation, considered as post-transcrption regulators. So far, a large number of miRNAs have been discovered in model plants, but little information is available on miRNAs in banana. In this study, by sequencing the small RNA (sRNA) transcriptomes of Fusarium wilt resistant and susceptible banana varieties, 139 members in 38 miRNA families were discovered, and six out of eight new miRNAs were confirmed by RT-PCR. According to the analysis of sRNA transcriptome data and qRT-PCR verification, some miRNAs were differentially expressed between Fusarium wilt resistant and susceptible banana varieties. Two hundred and ninety-nine and 31 target genes were predicted based on the draft maps of banana B genome and Fusarium oxysporum (FOC1, FOC4) genomes respectively. Specifically, two important pathogenic genes in Fusarium oxysporum genomes, feruloyl esterase gene and proline iminopeptidase gene, were targeted by banana miRNAs. These novel findings may provide a new strategy for the prevention and control of Fusarium wilt in banana.

DESIGN
miRNA-seq on leaf and root tissue from a fusarium wilt-resistant and wilt-susceptible banana variety.
