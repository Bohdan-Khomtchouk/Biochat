TITLE
Gene expression in epithelial, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NMuMG is an epithelial cell line that can be induced into EMT by TGF-β treatment or MET by TGF-β withdrawl. During EMT, several marker genes were downregulated/upregulated, which is consistent with its mesenchymal phenotype. Transcription factors that are regulated during EMT and its reverse process MET are candidate genes for the regulations of the EMT marker genes.

DESIGN
NMuMG cells treated with vehicle, TGF-β for 11 days, or 11days of TGF-β treatment followed by TGF-β withdrawl for another 13 days. RNA from these 3 conditions of NMuMG were extracted and subject to microarray analysis
