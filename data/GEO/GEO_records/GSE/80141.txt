TITLE
CAGE sequences from three developmental states in the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex.

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
We report the application of CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) on collections of Daphnia pulex individuals representing three major developmental states. This submission comes from a project of Michael Lynch and was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health entitled 'Population Genomics of Daphnia pulex' (Project Number: 1R01GM101672-01A1).

DESIGN
Characteriziation of the TSS landscape and transcriptionally-active putative promoters in three developmental states: adult parthenogenic (asexual) females, pre-ephipial (sexual) females and adult males.

PLATFORM
