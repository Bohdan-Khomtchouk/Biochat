TITLE
Expression data from human dental follicle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed the genexpression of dental follicle cells (DFCs) after 3 days osteogenic differentiation with BMP2 after transfection with a DLX3 plasmid (pDLX3) and after transfection with an empty plasmid (pEV)

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental follicle cells after transfection with pDLX3 and pEV and osteogenic induction with BMP2 at day 3
