TITLE
Gene expression profiles of spontaneous gastric tumors in the antrum of the stomach of 30,60, and 90 day old CEA424-SV40 -T antigen transgenic mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression in the antral portion of the stomach in control  and mice with a developing tumor to get further insight into the exact tumor type and the influence of local gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from tissue samples from the antrum. Follow up of gene expression over the time of the tumor development
