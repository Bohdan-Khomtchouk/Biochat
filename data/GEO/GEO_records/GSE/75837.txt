TITLE
Parental Effects on Seed Transcriptome-Metabolome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analyses on seeds developed in different parental conditions investigating the effect of the parental environment on the transcriptome of dry seeds of three different genotypes

DESIGN
RNA isolated from freshly harvested dry seed of three genotypes, the near isogenic line of DELAY OF GEMRMINATION 1 (DOG1), DOG3 and DOG6, grown in 15°C, 20°, low nitrate (N0), low light (LL) and SL (standard light). Please note that SL (standard light) is the control for the LL (low light), and  20C  is the control for both 15C and low nitrate (N0).
