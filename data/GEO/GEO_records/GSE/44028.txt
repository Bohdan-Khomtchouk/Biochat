TITLE
Analysis of genes regulated by AS1 and AS2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
AS1 and AS2 encode MYB related protein and AS2-domain containing protein, respectively and may regulate transcription. These genes are involved in the determination of axes of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. To know the gene regulation in the leaf development, expression profile among wild-type, as1 and as2 mutants and AS2 overexpression plants were compaired.

DESIGN
shoot apices from as1-1, as2-1, AS2 overexpressing, and wild type embryos
