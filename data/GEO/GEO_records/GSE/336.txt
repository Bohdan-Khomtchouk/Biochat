TITLE
HaCaT keratinocytes day3 vs HaCaT keratinocytes day10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was cultured for three days (proliferation) or for ten days (differentiation). RNA from cells at day3 was compared to RNA from cells at day10. The microarray hybridizations were performed in dye-swap procedure : RNA from cells at day3 was labeled with Cy3 (GSM4674, GSM4675, GSM4682, GSM4683) and then with cy5 (GSM4680, GSM4681). Keywords = cell density differentiation program in human keratinocytes Keywords: repeat sample
