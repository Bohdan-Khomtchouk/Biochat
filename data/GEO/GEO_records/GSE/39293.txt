TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cidofovir treatment and resistance inHeLa, HaCaT, and PHK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with strong antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA viruses. Although it has previously been shown that cidofovir exerts an antiproliferative effect on HPV positive cells by the induction of apoptosis, the exact mechanism of action remains to be unraveled. In order to study the activity of cidofovir against HPV, gene expression profiling was performed in cidofovir-treated and cidofovir-resistant HeLa, HaCaT, and PHK cells by means of microarrays (HG-U133 Plus 2, Affymetrix).

DESIGN
Controls (untreated HeLa, HaCaT, and PHK wild-type cells): 72h of growth. Cidofovir treated (50 µg/ml) HeLa, HaCaT, and PHK cells: 72h of growth. Cidofovir resistant cells (HeLa #52 and HaCaT #51): 72h of growth. All samples were performed in triplicates.
