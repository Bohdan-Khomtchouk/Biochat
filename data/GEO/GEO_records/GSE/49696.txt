TITLE
Increased CLL Proliferation upon IgM stimulation is Sustained by the Up-regulation of miR-132 and miR-212: a Combined miRNA and Gene Expression Profiling Analysis and Correlation with Disease Progression [miRNA expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate a potential involvement of miRNAs in BCR stimulation, in the present work we first evaluated their expression following IgM cross-linking in CLL cells, as well as in healthy B lymphocytes. Next, to infer putative miRNA targeting networks, we combined miRNA profiling results with gene expression and functional analyses

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling analysis by microarray analysis of CLL samples and pools of CD19+ cells derived from healthy donors.
