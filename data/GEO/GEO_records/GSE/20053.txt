TITLE
C. elegans gene expression in response to Y. pestis KIM5 infection

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The response of the nematode C. elegans to Y. pestis infection was evaluated by gene expression profiling.  A synchronized population of nematodes were exposed to Y. pestis KIM5 for 24h.  Transcript levels from Y. pestis-treated animals were compared with animals maintained on relatively nonpathogenic E. coli OP50 for 24h.

DESIGN
Three independent RNA isolations were performed following exposure to either Y. pestis KIM5 or E. coli OP50.  Exposures to the different pathogens were performed in parallel for each replicate isolation.
