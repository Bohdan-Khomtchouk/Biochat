TITLE
Human breast cancer cell lines: vehicle vs. BMP7 incubation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-Î² superfamily of growth factors. They are known for their roles in regulation of osteogenesis and developmental processes and, in recent years, evidence has accumulated of their crucial functions in tumor biology. BMP7, in particular, has been implicated in breast cancer. However, little is known about BMP target genes in the context of tumor. We therefore explored the effects of BMP7 treatment on global gene transcription in five breast cancer cell lines during a 6-point time series. Data analysis included hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes, gene ontology enrichment analyses and model based clustering of temporal data. BMP7 had a strong effect on gene expression. The cellular functions most strongly affected were regulation of transcription and development. The observed transcriptional response followed a temporal sequence. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct differences in the response of individual cell lines to BMP7, but also highlighted a synexpression group of genes. Finally, this study provides a list of potential novel BMP target genes relevant in breast cancer.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, vehicle-treated vs. BMP7-treated. Five cell lines were tested at six time points each, what makes a total of 30 samples. RNA samples from three biological replicates were pooled before hybridization.
