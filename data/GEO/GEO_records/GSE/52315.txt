TITLE
Gene expression profile of MM1S under normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MM1S cells have been cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and gene expression profiling has been performed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to dissect the possible changes occurring at the mRNA level in normoxic cells versus hypoxic cells.
