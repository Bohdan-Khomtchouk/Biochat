TITLE
Runx1 Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture Sequencing in Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) with six baits located at the Runx1 locus in the mouse hematopoietic progenitor cell line HPC-7. 4C baits were designed to the P1 and P2 promoters and to the previously characterised +24 hematopoietic enhancer (P1, P2 and 24), with secondary baits located at nearby cohesin/CTCF (cc) binding sites (P1cc, 24cc, P2cc).

DESIGN
For each 4C-seq bait, two replicates and one control library (in which the first ligation step was omitted) were sequenced.
