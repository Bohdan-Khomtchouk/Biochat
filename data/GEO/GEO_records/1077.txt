TITLE
Hematopoietic stem cells from different recombinant inbred strains

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Lin- Sca-1+ c-kit+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from 22 different BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Each RI strain is homozygous for alleles at about 98% of loci. Results combined with QTL mapping to identify candidate genes for the control of HSC function.
