TITLE
Breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line response to 27-Hydroxycholesterol and estradiol

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 cells treated with 27HC in the presence of E2. 27HC, a primary metabolite of cholesterol and an estrogen receptor (ER) ligand, increases ER-dependent growth in mouse models of breast cancer. Results provide insight into a relationship between hypercholesterolemia and breast cancer.
