TITLE
Transcription factor Sp3 deficiency effect on the embryonic heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts from embryonic day 12.5 C57Bl/6 mutants deficient for the zinc finger transcription factor Sp3. C57Bl/6 animals lacking Sp3 die before birth. Results provide insight into the role of Sp3 in the development of the embryonic heart.
