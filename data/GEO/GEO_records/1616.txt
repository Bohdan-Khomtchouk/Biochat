TITLE
Akt kinase constitutive activation effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing a myristoylated, active form of Akt (myr-Akt) kinase. Myr-Akt expression maintains pluripotency of ES cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Results demonstrate Akt signaling is sufficient to maintain ES cell pluripotency.
