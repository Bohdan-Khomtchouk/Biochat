TITLE
C-C Chemokine receptor 5 deficient lungs with melanoma metastasis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from CCR5-deficient mutants 6 to 48 hrs after tail vein injection with B16-F10 melanoma cells. Lungs of CCR5-deficient mutants develop fewer metastatic nodules than in wild type animals. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CCR5-dependent  metastasis.
