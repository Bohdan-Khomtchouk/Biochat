TITLE
Neurospheres derived from adult and embryonic brain regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of neurospheres derived from adult brain regions (neocortex, striatum, and subventricular zone) and dorsal and ventral forebrain neural tubes and spinal cord from E14.5 embryos. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis of the mammalian brain.
