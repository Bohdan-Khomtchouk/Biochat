TITLE
Wing imaginal disc proneural cluster cells of the peripheral nervous system

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of wing imaginal disc proneural cluster cells (PNCs) of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). PNS PNCs adopt the sensory organ precursor cell fate. PNCs purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Results provide insight into the function of proneural genes in neurogenesis.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
