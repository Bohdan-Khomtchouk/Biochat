TITLE
Early postnatal skeletal muscle stem cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of myogenic stem cells called satellite cells (mSCs) FACS-sorted from the trunk of Pax3GFP/+ mice at postnatal days 1, 12, and 28, a period when most mSCs are in proliferation and quiescence states. Results provide insight into molecular basis of early postnatal skeletal muscle development.
