TITLE
Transcription factor IIF cofactor GAS41 overexpression

SUMMARY
Analysis of SaoS2 cells overexpressing GAS41, a cofactor of the general transcription factor IIF. GAS41 expression from a tet-off vector was suppressed by the addition of doxycycline. Results provide insight into the role of GAS41 in eukaryotic transcription initiation.
