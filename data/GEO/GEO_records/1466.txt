TITLE
DICER-LIKE 4 mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of rosette leaf and inflorescence tissues from the DICER-LIKE (DCL) 4 mutant dcl4-2. DCL genes have specialized functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. Results provide insight into the role of DCL4 in the trans-acting siRNA pathway.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
