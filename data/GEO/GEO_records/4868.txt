TITLE
Interleukin-3 effect on acute myeloid leukemia patient mononuclear cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML 1-4) cultured in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) for up to 16hrs. The overexpression of IL-3RÎ± in AML has been associated with reduced overall survival. Results provide insight into the role of IL-3 signaling in AML.
