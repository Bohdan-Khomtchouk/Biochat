TITLE
Potassium chloride depolarizing effect on cortical neurons

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cortical neurons depolarized by treatment with 25 mM potassium chloride for 4 hours. Cortical neurons obtained from 17-day-old embryos and grown for 14 days in vitro prior to treatment. Results identify genes that are differentially expressed upon depolarization.
