Stem cell antigen-1 deficient mammary tumor

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary tumors from mutants lacking stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), a glycerophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Tumorigenesis induced by medroxyprogesterone and 7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene treatment. Results provide insight into the role of Sca-1 in mammary gland tumorigenesis.
