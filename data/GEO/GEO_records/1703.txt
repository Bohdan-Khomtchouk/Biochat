TITLE
Dark-grown phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of dark grown Ler seedlings mutant for phytochromes A and B, or cryptochromes cry1 and cry2, or both. Results provide insight into the structure of the signaling network between the photoreceptor families and the target developmental genes that respond to light.

ORGANISM
