TITLE
In vitro differentiated amniotic-fluid kidney progenitor cell-podocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentiated cells: triple positive sorted, amniotic-fluid kidney progenitor cell-podocytes (hAKPC-P) and conditionally immortalized re-differentiated podocytes (hIPod). Results provide comparison of cell types and insight into mechanisms of stem cell differentiation into podocytes.
