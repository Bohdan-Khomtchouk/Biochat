TITLE
Histone deacetylase HDAC7 re-expression effect on pre-B cell transdifferentiation into macrophages: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of C10 pre-B cells transduced with a vector for HDAC7 expression then treated with Î²-estradiol to induce transdifferentiation into macrophages for up to 72 hr. Dysregulated HDAC activity is associated with B cell malignancies. Results provide insight into role of HDAC7 in B lymphopoiesis.
