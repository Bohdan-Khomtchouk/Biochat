TITLE
Neonatal ovarian xenobiotic cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of ovaries from Swiss neonates cultured in media containing xenobiotics: 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, methoxychlor, menadione. Non-renewing follicles are vulnerable to xenobiotic insult. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying xenobiotic-induced preantral ovotoxicity.
