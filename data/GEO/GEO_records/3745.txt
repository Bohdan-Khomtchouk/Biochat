TITLE
Sulfur deprivation effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures grown under sulfur starvation conditions for up to 72 hrs.  During S limitation, production of hydrogen, a clean and sustainable energy carrier, increases substantially. Results provide insight into gene expression changes during the transition to S starvation.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
