TITLE
Histone deacetylase RPD3 deletion and histone mutations effect on gene regulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene regulation by expression profiling of single mutants for histone deacetylase RPD3, histones H3 and H4, and double mutants for either RPD3 and H3 or RPD3 and H4.  Histone mutants defective in amino terminal tails, which are acetylated and deacetylated in transcription regulation.
