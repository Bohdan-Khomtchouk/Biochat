TITLE
SIRT3 deficient liver response to a high fat diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of mitochondrial protein deacetylase SIRT3 null mutants on a high fat diet (HFD). SIRT3 null mutants on a HFD exhibit obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and steatohepatitis. Results provide insight into molecular basis of metabolic dysfunction in SIRT3-deficient livers.
