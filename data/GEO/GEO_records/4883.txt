TITLE
Liver response to a metformin supplemented high fat diet deficient in methionine and choline

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals fed a methionine- and choline- deficient, high fat diet (MCD+HF) containing metformin. MCD+HF models non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Results provide insight into the feasibility of using metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, to treat NASH without underlying diabetes.
