TITLE
Mitochondrial stress effect on ATFS-1 mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of atfs-1 mutants raised on spg-7(RNAi) which induces mitochondrial stress (MS). ATFS-1 (activating transcription factor associated with stress-1) senses MS and communicates with the nucleus during the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Results provide insight into the MS response.
