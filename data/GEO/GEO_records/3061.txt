TITLE
Ribosomal protein null mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants each deficient in one of various ribosomal proteins. S. cerevisiae contains many duplicated genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Results provide insight into the unique role of each member of a pair of ribosomal protein paralogs.
