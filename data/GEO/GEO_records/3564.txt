TITLE
Rapid stimulation effect on an in vitro atrial (HL-1) myocyte model

SUMMARY
Analysis of spontaneously contracting HL-1 atrial cells rapidly stimulated for 24 hr. The resulting electrical remodeling of the HL-1 cells resembles that seen in atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial tachycardia (AT). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of early atrial myocyte remodeling.
