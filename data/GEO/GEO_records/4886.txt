TITLE
Histone deacetylase 3 deficiency effect on the heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of 6 week old mutants deleted for histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). HDAC3 deletion occurred 7 days after birth. These MCH3-KO mutants are viable on normal chow but a high fat diet is lethal. The results underscore the impact gene-diet interactions may have on cardiovascular health.
