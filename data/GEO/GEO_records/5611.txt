TITLE
Sirtuin-1 deficiency effect on adult secondary neurospheres

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult secondary neurospheres derived from hippocampal neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells of sirtuin-1 knockout mice. Sirt1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylase. Results provide insight into the role of Sirt1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
