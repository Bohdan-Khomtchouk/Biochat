TITLE
Radiation chimera model: Trp53-null mammary tumors arising from irradiated, wildtype hosts

SUMMARY
Analysis of Trp53-null mammary tumors arising from WT hosts cleared of mammary gland epithelium, irradiated, then transplanted with nonmalignant Trp53-null mammary tissue. Results provide insight into the influence of the radiation response of the microenvironment on the carcinogenic process.
