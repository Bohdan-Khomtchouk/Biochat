TITLE
Pristane-induced arthritis effect on AIRmax high acute inflammation model: footpad

SUMMARY
Analysis of footpad from outbred animals with high (AIRmax) acute inflammation following two injections of pristine at 60-day intervals. Arthritis development was examined twice weekly for 160 days. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying arthritis induction and progression.
