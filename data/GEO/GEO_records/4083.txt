TITLE
Lapatinib-resistant HER2-positive breast tumor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of BT474 (lapatinib-sensitive) and BT474-J4 (acquired lapatinib-resistance) HER2+ breast cancer cells treated with lapatinib, foretinib or both. Foretinib restored lapatinib-sensitivity in BT474-J4. Results provide insight into molecular basis of acquired lapatinib-resistance in BC cells.
