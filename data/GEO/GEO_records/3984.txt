TITLE
Insulin-Producing Cells generated from dedifferentiated pancreatic islet cells expanded in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of insulin-producing cells generated from expanded dedifferentiated islet cells induced with Redifferentiation Cocktail (RC). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying RC-induced phenotypic change in expanded islet cells towards the phenotype of uncultured islet cells.
