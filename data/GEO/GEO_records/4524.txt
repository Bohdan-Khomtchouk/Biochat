TITLE
Prenatal stress effect on serotonin transporter-deficient, female offspring: left hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of prenatally-stressed (PS), female offspring of serotonin transporter (5-Htt) +/- parents. Depressive behavior of PS, 5-Htt +/- mice is most pronounced in female offspring. Results provide insight into molecular basis of behavioral effects of gene Ã— environment interactions.
