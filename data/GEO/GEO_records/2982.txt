CD11b-plus CD11c-minus macrophages of the intestinal lamina propria

SUMMARY
Comparison of CD11b+ CD11c- macrophages of the small intestinal lamina propria and the spleen. The intestinal immune system responds robustly to pathogens yet remains tolerant to commensals and food antigens. Results provide insight into the role of intestinal macrophages in immune tolerance.
