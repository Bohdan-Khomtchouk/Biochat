TITLE
Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 effect on hepatoblasts grown on collagen-coated plates

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatoblasts expressing mutant IDH1 (R132C) and mutant IDH2 (R172K) grown on collagen-coated plates. IDH genes are frequently mutated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). Results provide insight into molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumor formation.
