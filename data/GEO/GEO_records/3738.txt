TITLE
UV-irradiation effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to UV stress. UV irradiation and desiccation stresses often co-occur in natural environments, making their combined effects important selective factors within microbial populations. Results compared to those from cultures subjected to desiccation stress.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
