TITLE
SIR2 knockout effect on virulence gene family silencing and activation

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 3D7 silent information regulator 2 homolog (Sir2) knockout at ring stage, 8 hours post-invasion. Results identify Sir2-mediated, reversible heterochromatin silencing as one tier of epigenetic regulation of the antigenic variation var gene family.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
