TITLE
Comparison of tobramycin-treated PA14 biofilm/CFBE and planktonic cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of PA14 biofilms grown on cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells and PA14 planktonic cultures treated with tobramycin, a CF antibiotic treatment. Results provide insight into P14 infection in the context of CFBEs and suggest P14's response to tobramycin is growth mode-dependent.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
