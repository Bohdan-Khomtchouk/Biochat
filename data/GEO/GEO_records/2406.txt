TITLE
Proto-oncogene Nmyc overexpression effect on the embryonic lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of embryonic day 18.5 transgenic embryos overexpressing Nmyc in the lung epithelia. Nmyc is a member of a family of proto-oncogenes that encode basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper proteins. Results provide insight into the function of Nmyc in the developing lung.
