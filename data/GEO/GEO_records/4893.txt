TITLE
Heart response to isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 mutations IDH2R140Q and IDH2R172K

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts from transgenics with conditionally-activated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 mutant (IDH2) R140Q and R172K alleles. Mutant IDH2 causes cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac defects associated with IDH2 mutations.
