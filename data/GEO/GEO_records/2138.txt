TITLE
Breast cancer cells resistant to green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate growth inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of NF639 breast cancer cells resistant to growth inhibition by green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) after initial EGCG sensitivity. EGCG inhibits growth of NF639 cells by inhibiting Her-2/Neu signaling. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying EGCG resistance.
