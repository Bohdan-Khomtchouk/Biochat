TITLE
Visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of visual cortices before the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity opens [postnatal day 14 (P14)], at the peak sensitivity of the critical period (P28), and after the critical period (P60). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with the critical period.
