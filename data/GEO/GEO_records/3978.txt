TITLE
Chronic cardiac pressure overload effect on adrenal medulla

SUMMARY
Analysis of microdissected adrenal medullary tissue from C57BL/6J males subjected to cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 8 wks. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying adrenal hypertrophy in response to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

ORGANISM
