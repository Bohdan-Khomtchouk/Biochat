TITLE
CD38-positive and CD38-negative chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of paired CD38(+) and CD38(-) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from six patients. CD38 expression is an important prognostic marker in CLL with high levels of CD38 antigen associated with shorter overall survival. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this association.
