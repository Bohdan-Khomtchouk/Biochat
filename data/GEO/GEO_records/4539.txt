TITLE
TRIF-deficient Herpes simplex encephalitis patient: fibroblast response to interleukin-1β and TLR3 agonist poly (I:C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of SV40 skin fibroblasts collected from an HSV1 encephalitis (HSE) patient with TRIF deficiency (homozygous TRIF nonsense mutation) and stimulated with IL-1β or poly I:C . TRIF is the sole adaptor protein for TLR3. Results provide insight into the role of the TLR3 pathway in HSE.
