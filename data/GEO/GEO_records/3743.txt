TITLE
Iron depletion effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to iron starvation. Fe concentrations started at 1uM or 2uM, and ended at 0.5uM.  Fe is required for the growth and development of all organisms. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria stress response to Fe limitation.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
