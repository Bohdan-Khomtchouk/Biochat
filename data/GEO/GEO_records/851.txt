TITLE
Extraocular muscle: comparison of global and orbital layers

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of microdissected global and orbital layers of the rectus extraocular muscle (EOM) from 2 adult Sprague-Dawleys. By identifying molecular differences between the 2 layers, results provide insight into the possible specialized function of each muscle layer.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
