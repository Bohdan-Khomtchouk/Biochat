TITLE
haa1 null mutant response to copper availability

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of haa1 null mutants cultured in the presence of 100 uM copper sulfate or 100 uM bathocuproine sulfonate, a copper chelator. Haa1 is a homolog of Ace1, a copper-binding transcription factor. Results provide insight into the function of Haa1.

ORGANISM
