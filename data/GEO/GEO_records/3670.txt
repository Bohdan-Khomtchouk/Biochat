TITLE
Hypochlorous acid effect on macrophage cell line: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells treated with up to 3.5 mM hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl exposure can occur from chlorine gas inhalation or from endogenous sources of HOCl, such as respiratory burst by phagocytes. Results provide insight into the dose-dependent molecular response to HOCl.
