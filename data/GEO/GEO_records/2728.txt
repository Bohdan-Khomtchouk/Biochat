TITLE
CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma-derived cancer stem cell lines

SUMMARY
Comparison of CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma-derived cancer stem cells (CSC). Both CSC subpopulations were derived from primary glioblastomas. Results provide insight into the role of CD133+ and CD133- CSCs in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma.
