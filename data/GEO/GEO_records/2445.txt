TITLE
Polycomb group protein depletion effect on embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts depleted of the polycomb group (PcG) proteins EZH2, EED, SUZ12, or BMI-1. PcG proteins form complexes that regulate the expression of homeotic genes during development. Results provide insight into the mechanisms employed by PcGs to control development.
