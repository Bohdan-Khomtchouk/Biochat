TITLE
Integrin alpha7 overexpression effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle from transgenic females overexpressing integrin alpha7. Enhancement of alpha7 integrin levels alleviates pathology in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy murine model. Results provide insight into effects of increased integrin alpha7 on skeletal muscle transcription in vivo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
