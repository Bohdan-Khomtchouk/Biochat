TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast in vitro model of hypothermia: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts exposed in vitro to mild hypothermia (32°C) or normothermia (37°C) for up to 18 hrs. Hypothermia is a clinically effective therapy for various hypoxic and ischemic conditions. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the therapeutic effects of hypothermia.
