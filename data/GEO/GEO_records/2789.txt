TITLE
LIM homeobox protein cofactor dominant negative form effect on breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MCF-7 cells after the induction of expression of a dominant negative form of the cofactor of LIM domains (CLIM), a co-regulator of the nuclear LIM only protein 4 (LMO4). LMO4 is upregulated in breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of LMO4 in tumor formation.
