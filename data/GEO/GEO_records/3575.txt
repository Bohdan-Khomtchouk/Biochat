TITLE
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor deficiency effect on Langerhan cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Langerhan cells (LCs) lacking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). LCs are Ag-presenting cells of the epidermis. AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in low molecular mass chemical metabolism and cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of AhR in LC.
