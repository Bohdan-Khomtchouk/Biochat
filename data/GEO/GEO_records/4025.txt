TITLE
Streptozotocin-induced diabetic model with acute myocardial infarction: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of remote zone tissues of left ventricular (LV) free wall up to 56 days post- acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a STZ-induced diabetic model of myocardial infarction (MI) without any glucose control or reperfusion.  Results provide insight into time course effects of hyperglycemia on MI.
