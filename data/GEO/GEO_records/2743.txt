TITLE
Brown and white adipocyte differentiation

SUMMARY
Comparison of brown and white preadipocytes at the undifferentiated and differentiating stages. Unlike white adipocytes, brown adipocytes have an abundance of mitochondria and are thus able to contribute to energy expenditure. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this difference.
