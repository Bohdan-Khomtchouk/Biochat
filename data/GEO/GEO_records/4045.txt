TITLE
CBFA2T3 knockdown and ectopic IKKbeta(EE) expression effect on Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reh cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Reh cells following transfection with shRNA targeting CBFA2T3, constitutively active IKKbeta(EE), or both in combination. Loss of CBFA2T3 expression is linked to LTR derepression. Results provide insight into the involvement of LTR derepression in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas.
