TITLE
Cell culture model of extra-embryonic endoderm

SUMMARY
Analysis of blastocyst-derived extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) cell lines and an embryonic stem (ES) cell line. Results identify independent XEN cell lines that express markers of extra-embryonic endoderm, but not those of the epiblast, and thus represent a new model of an early mammalian lineage.
