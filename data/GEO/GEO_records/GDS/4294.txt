TITLE
All-trans retinoic acid effect on retinoic acid receptor α-deficient F9 teratocarcinoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of F9 teratocarcinoma cells depleted of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α and treated with all trans retinoic acid (atRA) in the presence of cycloheximide. RARα translocation events are associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Results provide insight into the role of RARα in APL.
