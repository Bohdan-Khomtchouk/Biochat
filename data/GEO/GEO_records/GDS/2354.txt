TITLE
Mushroom body ablation effect on the brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of adult Canton S females following mushroom body (MB) ablation with hydroxyurea. MBs are the centers for higher-order functions in arthropod brains. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of MBs.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
