TITLE
Proinsulin C-peptide and TGF-beta 1 effect on proximal tubular cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HK2 proximal tubular cells (PTCs) treated with C-peptide, TBF-beta 1, or both agents for 18 or 48 hours. C-peptide alleviates TGF-beta 1-mediated phenotypic and morphological changes in PTCs associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). EMT contributes to renal fibrosis.
