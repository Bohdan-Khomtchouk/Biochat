TITLE
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) vitamin A and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) vitamin D stimulated peripheral blood monocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes stimulated with biologically active forms of vitamin A and vitamin D. Vitamin A plays a role in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial activities for vitamin A and vitamin D in monocytes.
