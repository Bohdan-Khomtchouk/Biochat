TITLE
Bone morphogenetic protein 4 and forskolin effect on embryonic AGM VE-cadherin+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin+ cells isolated from aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of E11.5 embryos then treated with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, or both. Results provide insight into the role of BMP signaling in AGM hematopoiesis.
