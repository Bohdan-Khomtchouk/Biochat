TITLE
BET inhibitor I-BET726 effect on non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells treated with 0.1 or 1 uM I-BET726, a BET inhibitor. MYCN is unamplified in SK-N-SH. BET inhibitors display anti-proliferative activity in MYC driven hematologic cancer models. Results provide insight into the anti-proliferative activity of I-BET726 in NB.
