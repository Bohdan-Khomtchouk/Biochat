TITLE
Age-related hearing loss model: cochlea

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochleas of 7 and 36 week old DBA/2J animals. The DBA/2J animal suffers from age-related hearing loss (AHL), a progressive disease characterized by an age-associated loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of AHL.
