TITLE
FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 acute myeloid leukemia model: sorted bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of KSL and GMP cells isolated from bone marrow of Flt3/ITD-SmoM2 transgenics at around 3 months of age when they developed leukemia. Wild-type and FLT3/ITD littermates of the FLT3/ITD-SmoM2 animals were also examined. Results provide insight into the role of SmoM2 in leukemic progression.
