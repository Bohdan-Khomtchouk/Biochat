TITLE
Ataxin-1-like knock out effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) purified from the bone marrow of Ataxin-1-like (Atxn1L) null C57Bl/6 mice at 8 weeks of age. The ataxia-associated Atxn1L gene is highly expressed in HSCs. Results provide insight into the role of Atxn-1L in HSC function.
