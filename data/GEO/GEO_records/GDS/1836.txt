TITLE
Androgen insensitivity syndrome: genital fibroblast response to dihydrotestosterone

SUMMARY
Analysis of genital fibroblasts from 46,XY females with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Response of cells to dihydrotestosterone examined. Most AIS affected individuals have mutated androgen receptors (AR). Results provide insight into the role of AR in genital differentiation.
