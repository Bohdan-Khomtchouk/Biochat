TITLE
Preinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of LCM-harvested high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) from cervices. If left untreated, a subset of the HSILs will progress to SCCs. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cervical cancer progression.
