TITLE
Caspase-1 deficiency effect on fasted liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from Casp1-null, C57BL/6 males in a fasted state. Caspase-1 is a cysteine protease that activates the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18. These results, together with those from GDS6176, provide insight into the role of caspase-1 in lipid metabolism.
