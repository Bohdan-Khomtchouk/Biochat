TITLE
Intraportal tacrolimus flushing effect on liver allograft

SUMMARY
Analysis of wedge biopsies from hepatic allografts perfused intraportally with tacrolimus before transplantation. Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, ameliorates ischemic reperfusion injury. Results provide insight into the effect of tacrolimus on the inflammatory response of the donor graft.
