TITLE
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase overexpression effect on the heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of left heart ventricles of transgenics overexpressing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 in their hearts. p38 is involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Results provide insight into the role of p38 in the heart.
