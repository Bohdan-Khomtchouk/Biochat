TITLE
H9 hESC-derived neural stem cells harboring pathogenic leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutation

SUMMARY
Analysis of LRRK2 (Gly2019Ser) mutant neural stem cells (NSC) treated with LRRK2 kinase specific inhibitor LRRK2-IN-1. The LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation causes familial Parkinson's disease. Results provide insight into molecular basis of progressive degeneration of NSCs caused by pathogenic LRRK2.
