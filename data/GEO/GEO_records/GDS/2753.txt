TITLE
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli biofilm response to 7-hydroxyindole and isatin

SUMMARY
Analysis of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli biofilm treated with 7-hydroxyindole or oxidized indole (isatin). Many bacterial oxygenases readily convert indole, an interspecies biofilm signal, into oxidized compounds. Results provide insight into the role of oxidized indoles in biofilm formation.
