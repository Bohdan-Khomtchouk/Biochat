SUMMARY
Analysis of psoriatic skin from back, ear from five psoriasis models (K5-Tie2, imiquimod, K14-AREG, K5-Stat3C and K5-TGFbeta1). Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by patches of red, often scaly skin. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying psoriasis.
