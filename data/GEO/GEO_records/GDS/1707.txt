TITLE
Aldosterone effect on kidney cortical collecting cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney epithelial cortical collecting duct cells treated with aldosterone for 1 or 6 hours. Aldosterone stimulates Na+ transport in tight epithelia. Results identify candidate genes that regulate Na+ transport via the epithelial Na+ channel and mediate the early response to aldosterone.

ORGANISM
