TITLE
Early events in of DBA/2J model of glaucoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of optic nerve head and retina from 10.5-month-old, DBA/2J females at various stages of glaucoma. The DBA/2J strain is an inherited, later-onset, complex, and chronic model of glaucoma. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of glaucoma.
