TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibitor and chemotherapy combined effect on Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Raji Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor HDACi (sodium butyrate, NaB) or chemotherapy (VP-16) or both for 24 hours. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of combined HDACi/VP-16 therapy of this aggressive B-cell lymphoma.
