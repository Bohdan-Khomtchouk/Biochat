TITLE
Host response to uninfected Ixodes scapularis nymphal tick attachment: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ear bite-site biopsies from BALB/c hosts up to 12 hours after post nymphal tick infestation. Tick saliva facilitates and enhances viral infection. Results provide insight into immunomodulation at tick-host interface induced by tick saliva that facilitates tick-born virus transmission.
