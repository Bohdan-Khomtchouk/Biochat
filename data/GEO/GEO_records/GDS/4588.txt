TITLE
APCΔ468 model of polyposis: regulatory T cells from various organs

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-regulatory cells (Treg) from various organs (small intestine, spleen, mesenteric lymph node) of polyp-ridden Foxp3-GFPxAPCΔ468 reporter males. Tregs from the polyposis model promote cancer. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying these pathogenic Tregs.
