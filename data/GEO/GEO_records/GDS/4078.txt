TITLE
Acquired paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 cancer cells response to bexarotene treatment

SUMMARY
Analysis of acquired paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells treated with bexarotene-PTX or PTX. Retinoid X receptor-selective agonist bexarotene was efficacious in treating chemo-resistant cancer cells. Results provide insight into bexarotene’s role in overcoming acquired drug resistance.
