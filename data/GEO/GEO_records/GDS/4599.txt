TITLE
ZNF750 silencing effect on differentiated keratinocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of ZNF750-silenced HaCaT keratinocytes (KCs) at day 12 of calcium-induced differentiation. ZNF750 knockdown in HaCaT KCs leads to sustained cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying keratinocyte terminal differentiation.
