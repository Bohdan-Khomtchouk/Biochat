TITLE
Anti-Mullerian hormone effect on ovary

SUMMARY
Analysis of postnatal day 4 ovaries cultured with anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) for 10 days. AMH is an extracellular signaling molecule that inhibits the primordial to primary follicle transition in ovary. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying primordial follicle development.
