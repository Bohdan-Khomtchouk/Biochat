TITLE
Lung response to thoracic irradiation: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of total lung from C57Bl/Ncr females exposed to 0, 5, or 17.5 Gy at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30 weeks after thoracic irradiation. The lungs show extensive fibrosis at 30 weeks after 17.5 Gy. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF).
