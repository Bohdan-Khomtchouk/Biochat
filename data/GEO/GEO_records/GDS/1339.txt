TITLE
T cell anergy induction regulation by Egr-2 and Egr-3 (MG-U74C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pooled mRNA (2, 4, 6 hours) from A.E7 T cell clones activated in conditions that promote (anti-TCR) or inhibit (anti-TCR + CsA or PKCi or Combo) anergy induction.  Results identify the early growth response gene 2 (Egr-2) and Egr-3 as key positive regulators of T cell anergy induction.
