TITLE
Silent Information Regulator 2-related gene OsSRT1 knockdown effect on rice leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of rice leaves following RNAi knockdown of OsSRT1, a Silent Information Regulator 2 (SIR2)-related gene. Members of the SIR2 family are NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases. OsSRT1is one of the two SIR2-related genes found in rice. Results provide insight into the function of OsSRT1.
