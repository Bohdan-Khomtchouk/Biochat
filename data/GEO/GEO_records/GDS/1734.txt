TITLE
Sucrose effect on dark-grown seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of Columbia glabra (gl1-1) seedlings grown in the dark at 23°C for 4 days then treated with 90 mM sucrose for 6h. Sugar status regulates mechanisms controlling growth and development of plants. Results identify sucrose-modulated genes and provide insight into sugar sensing mechanisms.
