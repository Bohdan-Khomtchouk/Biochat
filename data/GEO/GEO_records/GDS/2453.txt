TITLE
PPAR-gamma activation and RAR-alpha inhibition effect on dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) treated with the PPAR-gamma ligand rosiglitazone alone or with the RAR-alpha antagonist AGN193109. DCs treated with the RAR-alpha agonist AM580 also examined. Results provide insight into the contribution of retinoid signaling to the PPAR-gamma response.
