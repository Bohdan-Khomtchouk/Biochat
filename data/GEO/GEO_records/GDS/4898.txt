TITLE
TGFβ inhibitor effect on induced cardiomyocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts during conversion to induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) in the presence of TGFβ inhibitor SB431542. SB increases the efficiency of iCM generation.  Results provide insight into role of TGFβ signaling on conversion of fibroblasts to iCMs.
