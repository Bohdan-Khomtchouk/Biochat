TITLE
Dysferlin deficiency effect on skeletal and cardiac muscles

SUMMARY
Comparison of skeletal and cardiac muscles of dysferlin deficient SJL/J animals. Dysferlin deficiency results in skeletal muscle weakness, but does not affect the heart. Dysferlin mutations can result in the neuromuscular disorders Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Myoshi myopathy.
