TITLE
Proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib or proteasome subunit knockdown effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells stimulated with bortezomib or depleted of PSMB3 or PSMB5. Proteasome inhibition can regulate estrogen-induced transcription. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which proteasome inhibition influences ERα function and into improved strategies for breast cancer treatment
