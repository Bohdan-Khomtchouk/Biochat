TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide excess effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to hydrogen peroxide excess (3 mM) for up to 7 hrs. H2O2 is the paradigm reactive oxygen species (ROS) agent. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria stress response to H2O2 toxicity.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
