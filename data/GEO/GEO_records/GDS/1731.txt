TITLE
Caerulein effect on transcription factor Mist1 null pancreas

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas from transcription factor Mist1 knockouts (Mist1KO) injected with caerulein.  Mist1KOs exhibit disrupted cell morphology in adult pancreatic acini; caerulein induces acute pancreatitis. Results identify genes that may contribute to susceptibility and initiation of pancreatitis.
