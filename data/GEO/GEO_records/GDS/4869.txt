TITLE
Imatinib mesylate effect on bone marrow hematopoietic cells of chronic myeloid leukemia patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow hematopoietic cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients one month after imatinib mesylate (IM) therapy. CML is caused by expression of the BCR/ABL fusion oncogene. Results provide insight into the molecular consequences of IM blockade of oncoprotein Bcr-Abl in CML.
