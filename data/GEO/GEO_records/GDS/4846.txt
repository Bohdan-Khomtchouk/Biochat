TITLE
MED1 overexpression effect on prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells overexpressing the Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription factor 1 (MED1). MED1 is a coactivator of the androgen receptor and other signal-activated transcription factors. Results provide insight into the role of MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer.
