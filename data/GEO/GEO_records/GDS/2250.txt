TITLE
Basal-like breast cancer tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of sporadic basal-like cancer (BLC), BRCA-associated breast cancer, and non-BLC tumors. Sporadic BLC are phenotypically similar to BRCA1-associated cancers. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of BLC and BRCA1-associated breast cancer.
