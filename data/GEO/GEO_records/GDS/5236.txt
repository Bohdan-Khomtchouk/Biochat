TITLE
Sarcolipin deficiency effect on heart atrium

SUMMARY
Analysis of atria from mutants deficient for sarcolipin (SLN). SLN is a sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane protein expressed in atria and a regulator of cardiac SR CA2+ ATPase. Result provide further insight into the role of SLN in atrial CA2+ homeostasis.
