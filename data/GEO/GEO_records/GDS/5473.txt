TITLE
Short-term fasting effect on skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies collected at 1.5, 4, 10, and 24hr post-meal time from healthy young men subjected to a 24hr fast. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic adaptation to fasting in healthy humans.
