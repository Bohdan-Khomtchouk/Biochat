TITLE
Heat shock factor HSF1 null mutant fibroblast response to heat shock: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryonic fibroblasts lacking heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) at various time points up to 8 hours of heat shock. Results provide insight into the role of HSF1 in the regulation of gene expression during heat shock.

ORGANISM
