TITLE
Spermatogenesis regulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) treated Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells from 20 day rats were cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml ovine FSH and gene expression monitored 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after addition of FSH.

ORGANISM
