TITLE
Transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) knockdown effect on embryonic kidney cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293E cells depleted of transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43). Inclusions of TDP-43 are hallmarks of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of TDP-43 misfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.
