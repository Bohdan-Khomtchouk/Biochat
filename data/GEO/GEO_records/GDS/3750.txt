TITLE
Peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase DJ-1 knockdown effect on neuroblastoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells depleted of DJ-1, an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase. Mutations in the gene encoding DJ-1 cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson disease (AREP). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying DJ-1-mediated PD pathogenesis.
