TITLE
Rb null mutant embryonic fibroblast response to cisplatin

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinoblastoma (Rb) deficient embryonic fibroblasts treated with cisplatin. Rb is a tumor suppressor gene. Cisplatin is a genotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. Results provide insight into the role of Rb in the response of embryonic fibroblasts to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
