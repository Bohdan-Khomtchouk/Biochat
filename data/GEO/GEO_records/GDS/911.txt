TITLE
Growth-arrested cell: serum deprivation and contact inhibition growth-arrest comparison

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of T98G cancer cells in growth-arrest induced by 3 days of either serum deprivation or contact inhibition. Results show that targets of the p130- E2F4 repressor complex are downregulated under the two growth-arrest conditions.
