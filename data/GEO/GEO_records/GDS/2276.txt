TITLE
Embryonic stem cell line response to the conditional expression of neurogenin 3

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic embryonic stem cells induced with doxycycline to express neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) and differentiated for 3 or 10 days as embryoid bodies. Ngn3 is required for pancreatic islet development. Results provide insight into Ngn3-regulated molecular events during development.
