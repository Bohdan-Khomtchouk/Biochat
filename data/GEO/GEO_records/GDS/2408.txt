TITLE
B cell-activating factor of the TNF family effect on B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of total and polysomal RNAs from B cells stimulated with B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF).  BAFF promotes B cell survival. Results provide insight into the signaling mechanisms underlying BAFF-mediated B cell survival.
