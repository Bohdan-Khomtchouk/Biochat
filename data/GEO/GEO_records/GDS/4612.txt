TITLE
Early postnatal nerve tissue response to acrylamide: cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebellum from 3 week-old male Wistar pups treated daily with acrylamide (30 mg/kg) for 21 days. Acrylamide is a type-2 alkene monomer with established human neurotoxic effects. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of acrylamide neurotoxicity in developing nervous tissue.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
