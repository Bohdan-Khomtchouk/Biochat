TITLE
Age-associated aneuploidy model

SUMMARY
Analysis of germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes and metaphase II (MII) eggs obtained from young and old females. An increased incidence of aneuploidy is observed with increasing maternal age. Results provide insight into the molecular basis underlying the age-associated increase in aneuploidy.
