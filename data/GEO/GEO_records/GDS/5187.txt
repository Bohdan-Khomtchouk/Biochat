TITLE
Nitric oxide synthase-2 depletion effect on glioma stem cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of glioma stem cells depleted for nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2).  Glioma stem cells isolated from two different human glioma xenografts. NOS2 catalyzes the formation of nitric oxide. Results provide insight into the role of NOS2 in glioma stem cell profileration and tumor growth.
