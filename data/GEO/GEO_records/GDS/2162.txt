TITLE
CH1 domain deletion, p300 and CBP heterozygous null mutant hypoxic fibroblasts response to trichostatin A

SUMMARY
Analysis of trichostatin A (TSA)-treated hypoxic fibroblasts with deletions in CH1 domains of p300 and CBP, and a p300 or CBP allele knockout. TSA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Results provide insight into the role of deacetylase activity in CH1-independent hypoxia inducible transcription.
