TITLE
Lymphotoxin-beta receptor signaling inhibition effect on lymph nodes: time course (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph nodes from animals treated with soluble lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR)-immunoglobulin fusion protein (LTbetaR-Ig) for up to 35 days. LTbetaR-Ig inhibits LTbetaR activation, important in the differentiation of lymphoid germinal centers and follicular dendritic cells.
