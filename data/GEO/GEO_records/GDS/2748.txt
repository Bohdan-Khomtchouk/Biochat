TITLE
Homeodomain protein Lim1 deficiency effect on embryonic renal vesicles

SUMMARY
Analysis of Lim1-null renal vesicles microdissected from embryonic day 12.5 kidneys. In Lim1 null embryos, the formation of comma shaped bodies from renal vesicles is interrupted. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this developmental arrest.
