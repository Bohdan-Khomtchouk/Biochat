TITLE
Spared nerve injury model of peripheral neuropathic pain: dorsal horn of spinal cord

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult and neonatal dorsal horns of spinal cords 7 days after spared nerve injury (SNI). SNI is a model for neuropathic pain (NP). Partial peripheral nerve injury in adults result in NP-like hypersensitivity, but not in neonates. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of NP.
