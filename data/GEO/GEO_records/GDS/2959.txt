TITLE
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized leukocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukocytes from individuals before and after the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is used to boost granulocyte counts in immunocompromised patients. Results provide insight into the effect of G-CSF on the immune system.
