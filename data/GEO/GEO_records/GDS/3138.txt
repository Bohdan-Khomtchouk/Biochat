TITLE
Metastatic breast cancer cell line response to restored miR-335 expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer LM2 cells transfected with a vector expressing microRNA miR-335. LM2 is metastatic to lung. miR-335 expression is lost as breast cancer cells develop metastatic potential. Restoring miR-335 expression inhibits metastatic cell invasion of lung cancer cells.
