TITLE
Hypoxia effect on monocyte-derived, mature dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mature dendritic cells (mDC) generated from monocytes under chronic hypoxia (1%O2). Hypoxia is a common feature at pathologic sites that creates a unique microenvironment affecting cell phenotype and behavior. Results provide insight into the impact of chronic hypoxia on mDC development.
