TITLE
DBA/2J model of glaucoma: retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas from strain DBA/2J with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). A model for glaucoma, DBA/2J has mutations that lead to iris atrophy and pigment dispersion. These conditions result in increased IOP. Results provide insight into the molecular changes associated with IOP elevation.
