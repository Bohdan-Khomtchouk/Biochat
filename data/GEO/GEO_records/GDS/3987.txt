TITLE
Segmented filamentous bacteria gut colonization effect on nonobese diabetic mice: T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of T cells from spleen and gut of SFB-positive NOD mice. SFB induces a robust T-helper cell type 17 population in small-intestinal lamina propria (SI-LP). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the strong cosegregation of SFB positivity and protection from diabetes.
