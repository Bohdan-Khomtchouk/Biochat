TITLE
Pathogen-associated molecular-pattern curdlan effect on interleukin-2 deficient GM-CSF myeloid dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of GM-CSF myeloid dendritic cells (GM-DCs) isolated from interleukin-2 (IL-2) knockouts and activated with curdlan, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). GM-DCs secrete cytokines such as IL-2, upon PAMP activation. Results provide insight into role of IL-2 signaling in DCs.
