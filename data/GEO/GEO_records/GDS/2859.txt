TITLE
Splenocyte response to infection by virB mutant Brucella strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of splenocytes from animals infected with virB mutant Brucella arbortus strains. The virB operon encodes a Type IV secretion system (T4SS) essential for the intracellular survival and persistent infection by Brucella species. Results provide insight into the role of T4SS in infections.
