TITLE
Lupus nephritis model response to sirolimus-induced mTOR inhibition (Mu11KsubA)

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney from sirolimus-treated NZB/W F1 females at 36 and 42 weeks of age. Sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been efficacious in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis. Results provide insight into role of the mTOR pathway in autoimmune lupus nephritis.
