TITLE
Ovarian cancer xenograft tumor response to trastuzumab and pertuzumab

SUMMARY
Analysis of SKOV3 ovarian cancer xenograft tumors treated with trastuzumab (TZ), pertuzumab (PZ), or both. TZ and PZ target Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). Combined therapy results in enhanced antitumor activity. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this enhancement.
