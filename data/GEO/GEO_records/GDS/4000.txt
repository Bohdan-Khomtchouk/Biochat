TITLE
Type 2 diabetic (TALLYHO/JngJ x C57BL6) F2 males: liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of various tissues from TH x B6 F2 males with high triglycerides. TH mice are a polygenic model for type 2 diabetes (T2D) characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Results provide insight into quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting hypertriglyceridemia in TH mice.
