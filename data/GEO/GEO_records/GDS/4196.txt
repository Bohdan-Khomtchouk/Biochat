TITLE
Lysophosphatidic acid effect on RhoA GEF Exchange Factor NET1-deficient, AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of AGS gastric cancer (GC) cells depleted of NET1, a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA, and treated with lysophosphatidic acid, a RhoA activator. NET1 is up-regulated in GC and drives its aggressive phenotype. Results provide insight into the role of NET1 in GC.
