TITLE
Murine model of primary mitochondrial dysfunction

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatocytes from Pdss2 liver-specific knockouts. The mutant livers are depleted for Coenzyme Q (CoQ), a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Results from this mammalian model of primary mitochondrial dysfunction are compared to nematode models (GDS3452 and GDS3453).
