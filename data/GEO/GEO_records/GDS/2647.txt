TITLE
Asthma model: lungs

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole lungs of wild-type and recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficient animals sensitized and then challenged with the allergen ovalbumin. RAG deficient animals do not develop allergic asthma. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the allergic asthmatic response.
