TITLE
Half-udder model response to milking frequency and timing of mammary biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary biopsies from lactating cows assigned to unilateral frequent milking (2X daily of left udder half, 4X daily of right udder half). Biopsies obtained at 5 days in milk, immediately after the 4X udder half had been milked, or 2.5 h after both udder halves had last been milked.
