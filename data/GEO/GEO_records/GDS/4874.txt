TITLE
IQGAP2 knockout model of hepatocellular carcinoma: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from IQ-motif containing GTPase-activating protein 2 (IQGAP2) KOs at 6- and 24-months of age. IQGAP2 is a member of a multidomain scaffolding protein family that also includes IQGAP1 and IQGAP3. Results provide insight into a potential tumor suppressive role for IQGAP2 in liver.
