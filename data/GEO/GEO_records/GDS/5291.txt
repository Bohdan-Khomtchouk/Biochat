TITLE
T helper type 9 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of naive CD4+ T cells cultured under T helper type 9 (Th9), Th2, or Treg conditions for 5 days. Th9 cells are a subpopulation of CD4+ effector T cells that secrete high levels of interleukin-9. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the Th9 phenotype.
