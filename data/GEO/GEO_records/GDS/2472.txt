TITLE
Glucosamine and interleukin-1 beta effect on chondrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured articular chondrocytes treated with glucosamine for 6 hours and then by interleukin-1 beta for 14 hours. Cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Results provide insight into the anti-arthritic properties of glucosamine.
