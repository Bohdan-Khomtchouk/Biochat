TITLE
Mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 4 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines. MCL has the worst prognosis among B-cell lymphomas. Gene expression results combine with genomic profiling results to identify genes that are relevant to MCL pathogenesis and that could also represent possible therapeutic targets.
