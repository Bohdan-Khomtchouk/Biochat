TITLE
Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil effect on forebrain astrocyte culture: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of astrocytes treated with Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil for up to 24 hrs. ROCK inhibitors inhibit glial scarring, a reactive process involving astrogliosis that occurs after injury to CNS. Results provide mechanistic insights into beneficial action of fasudil during brain injury.
