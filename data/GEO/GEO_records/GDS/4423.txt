TITLE
Lung epithelium response to fungal allergen Alternaria

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial brushings of lung epithelium from C57BL/6 females after Alternaria challenge. Alternaria allergen is associated with severe asthma, including life-threatening exacerbations. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the acute innate airway response to Alternaria.
