TITLE
NF-kappaB subunit p65/RelA deficiency effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of lineage-negative, c-kit+ Sca-1+ Flk2- (LSKF) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking the NF-kappaB subunit p65/RelA. LSKF HSCs purified from the bone marrow.  Results provide insight into the role of NF-kappaB subunit p65/RelA in HSCs.
