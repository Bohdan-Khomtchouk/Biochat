TITLE
Carbon dioxide effect on fermenting yeast: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of chemostat cultures sparged with 79% or 100% carbon dioxide (CO2). During fermentation and ethanol production, CO2 is produced, saturating the fermentative broth. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying CO2 stress.
