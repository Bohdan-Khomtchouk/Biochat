TITLE
Transforming growth factor beta deficiency effect on embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic palatal mesenchyme (PM) cells from mice with a deletion of Tgfbr2 in cranial neural crest cells. These Tgfbr2fl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice develop cleft palate as the result of abnormal TGFβ signaling activation. Results provide insight into the role of TGFβ in palatogenesis.
