TITLE
Interferon regulatory factor-1 effect on transformed cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of myc/ras transformed cells expressing interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 mediates proliferation inhibition and reversion of the transformed phenotype of oncogenic cells. Results provide insight into the molecular alterations initiated by the action of IRF-1.
