TITLE
Beta-catenin inactivation effect on intestinal crypts

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal crypts following inactivation of beta catenin. The mucosa of the intestine is composed of submucosal invaginations called intestinal crypts. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying crypt loss as a result of beta-catenin inactivation.
