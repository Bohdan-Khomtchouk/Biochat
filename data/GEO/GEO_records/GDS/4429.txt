TITLE
Fetal brain response to maternal immune activation induced by lipopolysaccharide

SUMMARY
Analysis of fetal brains following maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by treating pregnant dams with lipopolysaccharide. MIA is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and autism. Results provide insight into the effect of MIA on the fetal brain at the molecular level.
