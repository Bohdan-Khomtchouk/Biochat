TITLE
Lateral root initiation model of auxin-induced cell division: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the root of early auxin signaling mutant slr1 treated with auxin species alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid for up to 6 hours. Auxin triggers lateral root initiation (LRI), marked by cell divisions in the pericycle. LRI is absent in slr1. Results provide insight into the early events of LRI.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
