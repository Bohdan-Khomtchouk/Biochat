TITLE
Ductal carcinoma in situ: mammary gland

SUMMARY
Analysis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of mammary gland. DCIS represents an early, pre-invasive stage in development of invasive breast carcinoma. These results, together with results from a rodent model of DCIS development, provide insight into molecular basis of early stages of breast cancer.
