TITLE
Asbestos effect on epithelial and mesothelial lung cell lines: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial and mesothelial lung cell lines at various time points up to 7 days after exposure to asbestos. Asbestos exposure causes lung diseases such as asbestosis, malignant mesothelioma, and lung cancer. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of asbestos-associated diseases.
