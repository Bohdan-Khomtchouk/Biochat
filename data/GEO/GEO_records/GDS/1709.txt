TITLE
Transcriptional regulator PpsR overexpressing and mutant strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of PpsR overexpressing and mutant strains grown at normal 20% oxygen. Expression examined in wild type cells at 0.5% oxygen. PpsR represses the transcription of a subset of biosynthetic genes in photosystem (PS) formation. Results suggest that PpsR is a master regulator of PS development.
