TITLE
Large airway epithelial cells from cigarette smokers with suspect lung cancer

SUMMARY
Analysis of large airway epithelial cells from cigarette smokers without cancer, with cancer, and with suspect lung cancer. Results provide insight into the feasibility of using gene expression to detect early stage lung cancer in smokers.
