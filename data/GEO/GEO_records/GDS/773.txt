TITLE
Retinoic acid teratogenic effect on cranial neural crest: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cranial neural crest exposed to 1 uM retinoic acid (RA) at various lengths of time up to 48 hours.  Neural crest obtained from 8.5 days postcoitum ICR embryos.  Results provide insight into developmental pathways affected upon exposure to teratogenic concentrations of RA.
