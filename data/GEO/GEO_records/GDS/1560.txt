TITLE
Beta-catenin activation effect on skin: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin of deltaNB-cateninER transgenics following the activation of beta-catenin for up to 7 days. Onset and duration of beta-catenin activation in deltaNB-cateninER transgenics controlled by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Results provide insight into how beta-catenin induces hair follicle growth.
