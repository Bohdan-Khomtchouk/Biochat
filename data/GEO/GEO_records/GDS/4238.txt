TITLE
Bronchial epithelial cell response to influenza virus, viral RNA and interferon-beta: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HBECs treated with IFNβ, wild-type H1N1 influenza (PR8), mutant ΔNS1 virus (PR8 with a deleted NS1 gene), viral RNA (purified directly from PR8), up to 18 hr post-treatment. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating influenza-host interactions in H1N1 infection.
