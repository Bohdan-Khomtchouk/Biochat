TITLE
Celiac disease: intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes (IE-CTLs), aberrantly expressing the cytolytic natural killer (NK) cell lineage receptor NKG2C, from celiac disease patients. Results provide insight into the role of IE-CTLs reprogrammed into NK-like cells in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.
