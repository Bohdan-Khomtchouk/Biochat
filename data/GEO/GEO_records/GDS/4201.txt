TITLE
Chronic hypoxia effect on dmDys model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: single whole animal

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3-5 day-old dystrophin-deficient animals exposed to chronic hypoxia (CH) for 2 weeks. Respiratory muscle necrosis in late-stage DMD is associated with respiratory insufficiency and CH. Results provide insight into the effects of CH on dystrophin-deficient muscle in vivo.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
