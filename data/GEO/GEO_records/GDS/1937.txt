TITLE
Early embryo development

SUMMARY
Analysis of early embryos at various stages of development: before zygotic transcription, during the slow and the fast phases of cellularization, and at the beginning and the end of gastrulation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of cellularization.

ORGANISM
