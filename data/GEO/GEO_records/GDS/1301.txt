TITLE
Cardiovascular response to chronic voluntary exercise

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) females after 5 weeks of wheel-cage running. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying improved cardiovascular health associated with exercise.
