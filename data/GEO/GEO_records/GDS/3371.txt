TITLE
Laminin alpha2 chain deficiency effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of hind limb skeletal muscle from 4-week old dy3K/dy3K animals, which completely lack expression of laminin Î±2 chain. Mutations in the laminin alpha2 chain gene cause congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder.
