TITLE
Transforming growth factor-β effect on fibroblasts in the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi conditioned medium

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β in the presence of T. cruzi-conditioned medium (PCM). A soluble factor(s) from T. cruzi inhibits TGF-ß-induced MAP kinase activation. Results provide insight into the ability of secreted parasite molecules to hinder agonist-induced host cell signaling.
