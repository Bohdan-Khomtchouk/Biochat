TITLE
Aged, lupus-prone MRL/Faslpr model: splenic CD4 T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4 T cells isolated from spleens of aged (16-24 wks) MRL/Faslpr females and sorted into 3 populations: CD62Lhi/PSGL1hi, CD62Llo/PSGL1hi, and CD62Llo/PSGL1lo. MRL/Faslpr animals exhibit lupus disease traits from 12-16 wks.  Results provide insight into molecular basis of lupus onset.
