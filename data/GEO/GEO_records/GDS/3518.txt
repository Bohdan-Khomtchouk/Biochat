TITLE
Chronic myelogenous leukemia response to imatinib: Philadelphia chromosome positive CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CD34+ cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with imatinib. The anti-cancer drug imatinib is a selective bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Results provide insight into the molecular events affected by bcr-abl inhibition through imatinib.
