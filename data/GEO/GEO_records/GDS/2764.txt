TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa response to 3,4-(di)hydroxy-heptyl-quinoline: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells treated for up to 20 hours with 3,4-(di)hydroxy-heptyl-quinoline (PQS), a bacterial intercellular signaling molecule. Results provide insight into the role of PQS in the bacterial communication system termed quorum sensing.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
