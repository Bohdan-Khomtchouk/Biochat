TITLE
Hormone-induced adipogenesis suppressed by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and EGF

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentiated C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts treated with 10 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and/or 10 nM EGF. Prior to treatment, cells induced to differentiate into adipocytes with IDMB hormone. EGF increases effectiveness of TCDD in suppressing hormone-induced adipogenesis.
