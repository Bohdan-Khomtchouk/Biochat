TITLE
DNA damage effect on memory and non-memory cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of memory and non-memory cells sorted from MD12/p53R2-RE cells 3 days after UV-induced DNA damage. Cells in a population respond heterogeneously to DNA damage. Results provide insight into heritable memory of DNA damage existing in subpopulations that differ in long-term cell behavior.
