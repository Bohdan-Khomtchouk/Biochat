TITLE
Exercise effect on diabetic skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of experimental type 1 diabetic skeletal muscle subjected to endurance training. Diabetic muscle atrophy is accompanied by changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Results suggest the diabetes-induced decrease in gene expression of ECM proteins is partially attenuated by training.
