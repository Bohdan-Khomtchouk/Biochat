TITLE
Cyanobacterial metabolite apratoxin A cytotoxic effect on colon adenocarcinoma cells: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cells at various time points up to 12 hours following treatment with 2 or 10 nM of the cyanobacterial metabolite apratoxin A. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of apratoxin A on tumor cells.
