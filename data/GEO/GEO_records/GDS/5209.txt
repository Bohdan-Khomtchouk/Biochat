TITLE
Obesity effect on perigonadal adipose tissue macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted FBC (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD11c+) cells and FB (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD11c-) perigonadal adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) from lean (C57BL/6J Lep +/+) and obese (C57BL/6J Lep ob/ob) mice. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-associated lipid metabolism in ATMs.
