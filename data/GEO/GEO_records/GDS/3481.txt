TITLE
NOR1 gene and EWS/NOR1 fusion gene overexpression

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells overexpressing NOR1 or the EWS/NOR1 fusion gene. NOR1 encodes an orphan nuclear receptor.  The EWS gene is involved in various malignancies by way of chromosomal translocations, and the EWS/NOR1 gene fusion is implicated in the pathogenesis of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas.
