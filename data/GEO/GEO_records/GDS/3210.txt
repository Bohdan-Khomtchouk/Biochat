TITLE
Airway epithelial cells response to Sendai virus infection in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary culture tracheal epithelial cells following infection with Sendai virus (SeV), a common paramyxovirus.Respiratory paramyxoviral infections are a leading cause of serious respiratory disease. Results provide insight into the role of epithelial cells in antiviral defense.
