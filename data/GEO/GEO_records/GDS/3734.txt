TITLE
Embryonic retina response to c-hairy1, Delta-1, Wnt2b transfections

SUMMARY
Analysis of E6.5 embryonic retinas expressing exogenous c-hairy1, Delta-1, or Wnt2b. Wnt signaling maintains retinal stem cell-like progenitor cells in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that keep retinal progenitor cells undifferentiated.
