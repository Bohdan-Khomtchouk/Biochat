TITLE
Sendai virus infection effect on monocytic cell line: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 monocytic cells infected at multiplicities of infection of 0.0002 and 0.02 with the Sendai virus. Results provide insight into the differences between the innate immune response of cells infected with a low and high concentration of virus.
