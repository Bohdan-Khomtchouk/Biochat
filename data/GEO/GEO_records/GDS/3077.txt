TITLE
Age-related aortic vasculopathy model

SUMMARY
Analysis of thoracic aortas (TAs) of Fischer 344/Brown Norway F1 hybrids (F344xBN) at 3 to 28 months of age. Age is a risk factor for vascular disease. The TAs of F344xBN animals exhibit age-related pathologies. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying age-mediated vascular pathology.
