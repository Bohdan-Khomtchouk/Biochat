TITLE
Pickle mutant seedlings response to gibberellin inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of pickle (pkl) mutant seedlings treated with the gibberellin (GA) inhibitor uniconazole.  PKL encodes a CHD3 chromatin remodeler that acts during germination to repress the expression of seed-associated genes. Repression of seed-associated traits is promoted in pkl mutant seedlings by GA.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
