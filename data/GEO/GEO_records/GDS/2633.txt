TITLE
Cytokinin-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 overexpression effect on rice leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic rice leaves overexpressing OsRR6, a cytokinin (CK)-inducible type-A response regulator. Results provide insight into the role of OsRR6 in CK signaling and further the understanding of the function of CK in rice.
