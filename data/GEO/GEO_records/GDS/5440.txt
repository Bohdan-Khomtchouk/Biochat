TITLE
Androgen effect on carboxyl terminal-binding protein 2-deficient prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of androgen receptor (AR)-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells depleted for carboxyl terminal-binding protein 2 (CTBP2) then treated with the androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Results provide insight into the molecular effects of CtBP2 knockdown on AR-mediated gene regulation.
