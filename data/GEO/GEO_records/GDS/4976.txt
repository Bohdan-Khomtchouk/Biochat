TITLE
Spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor effect on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the DHL4 and DHL6 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines following treatment with R406, a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor. SYK is a key component of BCR signaling which is a critical pathway in DLBCL. Results provide insight into the role of SYK in DLBCL pathogenesis.
