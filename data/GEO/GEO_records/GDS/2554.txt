TITLE
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphomas of transgenics engineered to constitutively express the dual bromodomain protein Brd2, which causes a malignancy similar to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLCL). Results provide insight into the similarity of DLCL lymphomas to activated B cells at the molecular level.
