TITLE
Macrophage response to interleukins 1 and 6

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) stimulated with interleukin (IL) 1 or IL-6 for 4 hours. Cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are not only produced by macrophages but also affect the cells in an autocrine manner. Results provide insight into IL-1 and IL-6 responsive genes in MDMs.
