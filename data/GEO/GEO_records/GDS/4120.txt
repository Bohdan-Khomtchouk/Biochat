TITLE
Androgen deprivation effect on prostate xenograft tumor LuCaP35

SUMMARY
NOD/SCID mice with established LuCaP35 xenografts were castrated, and tumors were isolated 4 weeks later. Androgen deprivation regresses androgen-dependent disease, but relapse often occurs in an androgen-independent manner. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of castration resistance.
