TITLE
Breast tumor-derived stromal-epithelial cocultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of high and low grade breast cancer cells co-cultured with stromal fibroblasts. In breast tumors, fibroblasts generally represent the most abundant cell type in the stroma. Results provide insight into malignant breast epithelial responses to stromal signaling.
