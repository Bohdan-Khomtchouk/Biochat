TITLE
Transcription factor STAT5b deficiency effect on the colon

SUMMARY
Analysis of colons of animals lacking the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription member STAT5b. STAT5b mutants are more susceptible to experimental colitis, associated with intestinal barrier function defects. Results provide insight into the role of STAT5b in colonic barrier function.
