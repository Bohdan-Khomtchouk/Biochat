TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide effect on transmembrane protease, serine 6 deficient liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from Tmprss6 knockouts (KO) and iron-deficient WT littermates treated with LPS to induce acute inflammation. Tmprss6 KOs are iron-deficient with high levels of hepcidin, a key iron regulator. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the Tmprss6 KO inflammatory response.
