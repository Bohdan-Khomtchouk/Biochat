TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibitor and hypomethylating agent effect on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of three large B-cell lymphoma cell lines treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat, hypomethylating agent decitabine, or both for 48hrs. Panobinostat synergizes with decitabine in DLBCL cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for this synergistic effect.
