TITLE
Rap1 DNA-binding mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of temperature sensitive Rap1 mutant cells subjected to a temperature of 37 degrees C to dissociate the mutant protein from its DNA binding sites. Results provide insight into the contribution of this general regulatory factor to transcription genome-wide.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

PLATFORM
