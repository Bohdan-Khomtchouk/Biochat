TITLE
Cervical cancer tumorigenesis

SUMMARY
Analysis of cervical cancer (CC) primary tumors and cell lines. Chromosomal amplification is a common cellular mechanism of gene activation in tumorigenesis; chromosome 20 is a commonly gained chromosome in CC. Results provide insight into the potential role of chromosome 20 gain in CC progression.
