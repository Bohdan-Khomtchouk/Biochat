TITLE
Histone/protein deacetylase (HDAC) 6-deficient CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory cells (Treg) from HDAC6-deficient C57BL6 mice. Foxp3+ Tregs are key to immune homeostasis and express multiple HDACs.  Results provide insight into the role of the HDAC6 isoform in the suppressive functions of Foxp3+ Tregs.
