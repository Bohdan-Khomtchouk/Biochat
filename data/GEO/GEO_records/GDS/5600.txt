TITLE
Acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 response to dasatinib treatment and withdrawal

SUMMARY
Analysis of dasatinib-sensitive, KITmut t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1 treated with dasatinib for 12 wks giving rise to R48 cells.  After 1 wk of dasatinib cessation, R48 cells give rise to PR48 cells. Results provide insight into molecular effects of long-term dasatinib treatment on t(8;21) AML.
