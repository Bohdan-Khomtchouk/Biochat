TITLE
Polyethylene glycol-conjugated G-CSF mobilized CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or polyethylene glycol-conjugated (pegylated) G-CSF mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from multiple myeloma patients undergoing chemotherapy. Pegylated G-CSF has a longer half-life than unconjugated G-CSF.
