TITLE
Azithromycin effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
Analysis of PAO1 cultures exposed to up to 2.0 ug/ml of the macrolide azithromycin (AZM) for 9 hours. Low-dose macrolides are effective therapy in patients with chronic lung infections such as those caused by P. aeruginosa. Results provide insight into mechanism of action of AZM against infection.
