TITLE
Monocyte-derived macrophage response to decoy receptor 3

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) treated with decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) recombinant fusion protein. DcR3, a TNF receptor superfamily member, is up-regulated in tumors from diverse lineages. Results provide insight into the role of DcR3 in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) development.
