TITLE
Reversine effect on myoblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 myoblast cells treated with reversine. Reversine induces dedifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and the subsequent redifferentiation to become multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying reversine's effects.
