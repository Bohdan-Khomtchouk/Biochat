TITLE
Chronic ethanol ingestion effect on lung alveolar type 2 cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung alveolar type 2 cells from Sprague-Dawley males following 6 weeks of chronic ingestion of alcohol. The lungs can be irreversibly damaged from chronic alcohol consumption. Results provide insight into the molecular changes in the lung associated with chronic alcohol consumption.
