TITLE
Alpha-synuclein deficiency effect on striatum and cerebellum: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of striatum and cerebellum from alpha-synuclein (SNCA) knockouts at 6 or 21 months of age. SNCA mutations result in impaired movement and depression/anxiety, manifesting in humans as Parkinson's disease (PD). Results provide molecular insights into physiological role of alpha-synuclein.
