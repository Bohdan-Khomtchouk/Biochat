TITLE
Mechanistic Indicators of Asthma (MICA) cohort: peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood from asthmatic and non-asthmatic children (ages 9 to 13), participants of the MICA study conducted by the EPA from 11/2006 to 01/2007 in Detroit, MI. These results, together with clinical biomarker measurements, may help to differentiate asthmatics from non-asthmatics.
