TITLE
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 and type 3 double knockouts: embryonic heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from E9.25 embryos double-mutant for intracellular Ca2+ release channels IP3R type 1 and type 3 (IP3R1-/-IP3R3-/-). The double-mutants show hypoplasia of the outflow region in fetal heart. Results provide insight into a redundant role for IP3R1 and IP3R2 during cardiogenesis.
