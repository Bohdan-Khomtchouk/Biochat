TITLE
Intermittent and sustained hypoxia effects on lung: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from adult males subjected to intermittent (IH) or sustained hypoxia (SH) for up to 30 days. IH is associated with sleep-disordered breathing, and SH with parenchymal lung disorders. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxic lung response during IH or SH.

ORGANISM
