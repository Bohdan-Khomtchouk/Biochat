TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor 2 effect on embryonic fibroblast: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts after treatment with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) at 4, 13, and 40 ng/ml for 24 hours. FGF2 promotes the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) . Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC self-renewal in response to FGF2.
