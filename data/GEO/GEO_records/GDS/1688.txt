TITLE
Various lung cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a set of 29 lung cancer cell lines consisting of 10 non-small cell adenocarcinoma, 10 small cell cancer, and 9 squamous cell cancer lines.  Gene expression results analyzed in relation to the sensitivity of each cell line to commonly used anti-cancer agents.
