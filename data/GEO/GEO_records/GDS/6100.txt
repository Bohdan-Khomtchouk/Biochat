TITLE
MicroRNA-135b overexpression effect on prostate cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP prostate cancer (PCa) cells overexpressing miRNA-135b for up to 36 hours. LNCaP cells express the androgen receptor (AR). MiRNA-135b overexpression in AR+ PCa cells results in slower growth compared to AR knockdown. Results provide insight into the basis of this slower growth.
