TITLE
Monocyte-derived macrophage response to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in vitro infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived macrophages isolated from Holstein-Friesian females in response to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MPTb) infection in vitro for up to 24hrs. MPTb is the etiological agent of Johne's disease. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the host immune response.
