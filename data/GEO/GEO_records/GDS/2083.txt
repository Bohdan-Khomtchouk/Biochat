TITLE
Limb immobilization effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis muscle after knee immobilization for 48 hours. Limbs immobilized due to injury or illness experience significant muscle atrophy within 1 or 2 weeks. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating the rapid protein degradation in immobilized skeletal muscles.
