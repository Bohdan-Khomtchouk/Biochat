TITLE
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphoid cell lines of Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, and acute leukemia origin. Aberrant NOTCH activity is involved in the pathogenesis of B cell-derived lymphomas. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of deregulated NOTCH activity.
