TITLE
Antitumor agent azinomycin B cellular effect: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells following treatment with 10 or 100 ug/ml of azinomycin B, a naturally occurring antitumor agent that forms interstrand crosslinks within the major groove of DNA. Results indicate that azinomycin B alters the expression of genes associated with DNA damage and repair.
