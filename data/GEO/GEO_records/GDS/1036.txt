TITLE
Microglial cell response to interferon-gamma: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of microglial cells obtained from 4 different samples following treatment with 200 u/ml interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).  Cells examined 1, 6, and 4 hours after treatment.  Results provide insight into the regulation of immune functions in microglia by IFN-gamma.
