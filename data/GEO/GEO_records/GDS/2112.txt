TITLE
Spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) at various time points following withdrawal and replacement of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF-family receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha1). Results provide insight into the mechanisms of GDNF-supported in vitro self-renewal of SSCs.
