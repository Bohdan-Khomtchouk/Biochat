TITLE
Simian Immunodeficiency Virus infection effect on lymph nodes of Sooty mangabeys and Rhesus macaques

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of lymph nodes of SIVsmm infected Sooty mangabeys (SM) and SIVmac239 infected Rhesus macaques (RM). SIVsmm is non-pathogenic to host SM but origin of pathogens (HIV-2/SIVmac) to humans and RM. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the differences in host responses.
