TITLE
Macrophage response to to Staphylococcus aureus infection in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived macrophages that phagocytosed S. aureus in vitro. Monocytes analyzed for up to 48 hours after phagocytosis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms employed by S. aureus to prolong their intracellular survival.
