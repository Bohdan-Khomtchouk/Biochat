TITLE
Nuclear receptor DHR96 ectopic expression effect on larvae

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic larvae overexpressing the nuclear receptor DHR96, an ortholog of the xenobiotic nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor. Results provide insight into the role of DHR96 in regulating xenobiotic responses.

ORGANISM
