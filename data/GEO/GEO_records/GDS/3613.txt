TITLE
Luteolin effect on pro-inflammatory challenged microglial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of lipopolysaccharide-activated microglial BV-2 cells treated with luteolin, a plant derived flavonoid. Luteolin possesses the ability to scavenge oxygen and nitrogen species, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activities. Results provide insight into the immuno-modulatory effects of luteolin.
