TITLE
High fat diet effect on aorta: time course

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in aortas of C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ fed identical high fat diets at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 40 weeks.  C57BL/6 has a greater tendency than C3H/HeJ to develop atherosclerotic aortic lesions when both fed identical high fat diets.
