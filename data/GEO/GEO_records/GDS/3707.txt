TITLE
Acute ethanol exposure: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of heads of animals exposed to ethanol vapor for up to 240 minutes. Increased ethanol intake is facilitated by the development of tolerance to the aversive and pleasurable effects of ethanol. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol tolerance development.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL1322 : [Drosophila_2] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array
