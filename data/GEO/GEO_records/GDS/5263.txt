TITLE
Enforced Grainyhead-like 1 expression effect on BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of BE(2)-C cells up to 72 hrs after transient transfection  with construct pTRex-GRHL1. The three mammalian GRHL genes (GRHL1, -2, and -3) represent a highly conserved family of Î²-scaffold transcription factors. Results provide insight into the role of GRHL1 in neuroblastoma biology.
