TITLE
20-hydroxyecdysone effect on cultured larval organs

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured larval organs treated with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) alone or in combination with cycloheximide to distinguish primary responses to 20E signal. Organs dissected from third instar larvae. Results provide insight into the molecular events triggered by 20E during insect development.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
