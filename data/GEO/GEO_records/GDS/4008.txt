TITLE
Myelomatous bone marrow cultures: contact versus contactless conditions

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured myeloma bone marrow (BM) cells fixed immediately following spread from the bottom well or after maintenance in suspension (delayed fixation for 60, 120 minutes). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in contact versus contactless growth in myeloma.
