TITLE
Transcriptional coactivator PGC-1beta hypomorphic mutation effect on the skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps muscles of animals bearing a hypomorphic PGC-1beta mutation. PGC-1beta is a transcriptional coactivator that stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration of cells. Results provide insight into the function of PGC-1beta in the skeletal muscle.
