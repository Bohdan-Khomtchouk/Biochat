TITLE
Commensal bacteria colonization effect on gnotobiotic model of food allergy: colonic epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from gnotobiotic animals selectively colonized with Bacteroides uniformis or Clostridia. Results provide insight into the role of microbial interactions with IECs in protecting against sensitization to food allergens.
