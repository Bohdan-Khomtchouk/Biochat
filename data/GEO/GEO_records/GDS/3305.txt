TITLE
Long term storage and recovery of kidney HEK293 cells at ambient temperature

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 spheroids and monolayer controls subjected to dry storage for up to 6 weeks, followed by 0hr or 72hr recovery (rehydration). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying long term metabolic arrest and recovery of HEK293 spheroids.
