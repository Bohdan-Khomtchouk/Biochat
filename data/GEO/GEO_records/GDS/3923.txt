TITLE
Soy protein diet effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from Sprague-Dawley males fed 1 of 6 diets: casein, casein+isoflavone (I), soy protein (SP), SP+I, casein+tofu, or tofu. Tofu and soy protein significantly lowered serum lipid levels. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced liver lipogenesis.
