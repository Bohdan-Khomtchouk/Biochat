TITLE
leu3 mutant expression profiles

SUMMARY
Analysis of leu3 mutant grown in either limited ethanol or limited ammonium media. Leu3p regulates a gene involved in nitrogen assimilation and six genes involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism. Results provide insight into the role of Leu3p in gene regulation.
