TITLE
Glucosamine treatment effect on KMH2 malignant lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell line KMH2 treated with glucosamine (GlcN) for 24 hr. GlcN induces the posttranslational modification of proteins with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms activated following GlcN intake.
