TITLE
Radiation therapy toxicity association with abnormal transcriptional response to DNA damage

SUMMARY
Analysis of UV and IR irradiated lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the peripheral blood of patients with acute radiation toxicity.  Samples taken 2 months after the completion of radiation therapy.  Results provide insight into the role of the response to DNA damage in radiation toxicity.
