TITLE
BRG1 maternally depleted embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of two-cell stage embryos maternally depleted for BRG1, a catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes. After fertilization, the embryo shifts from maternal to zygotic genome expression. Results provide insight into the role of Brg1 in this transition.
