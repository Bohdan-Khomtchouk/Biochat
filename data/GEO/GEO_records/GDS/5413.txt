TITLE
Core binding factor β deficiency effect on bone marrow derived-LSK hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of purified Lin-c-kit+Sca1+ LSK cells from Cbfβ- conditional knockout mice. Runx/Cbfb heterodimers play important roles in hematopoietic cell development. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which Cbfβ regulates cell fate decisions in bone marrow progenitors.
