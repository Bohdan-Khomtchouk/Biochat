TITLE
Liver response to simulated high-altitude hypoxic environments

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of C57BL/6 males housed for 32 days in chambers that simulated the hypoxic environment of an altitude of 1400, 3000, or 4500 meters. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying acclimatization to high altitude hypoxia.
