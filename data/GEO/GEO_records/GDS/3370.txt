TITLE
Staufen1 deletion effect on mRNA abundance in HeLa cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells depleted of Staufen1 (Stau1). Stau1 is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that mediates mRNA decay (SMD) and is utilized by mammalian cells to regulate gene expression.  Results provide insight into additional mechanisms by which Stau1 may regulate mRNA abundance.
