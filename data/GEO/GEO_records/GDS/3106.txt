TITLE
Stat3 deficiency effect on pulmonary alveolar type II epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of type II alveolar cells lacking signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). STAT3 mediates gene expression in response to numerous growth factors and cytokines, playing an important role in many cellular processes. Results provide insight into the role of Stat3 in lung.
