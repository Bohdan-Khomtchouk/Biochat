TITLE
Notch1 promoter deletion effect on Ikaros-deficient model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: thymic lymphoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of thymic tumors from Ikaros-deficient (IkL/L) mice with a Notch promoter/exon1 deletion. The deletion of Notch1 promoter results in oncogenic activation of Notch1 and significantly accelerates leukemogenesis. Results provide insight into role of Notch activation in pathogenesis of T-ALL.
