TITLE
slbo mutant migratory cells of the ovary

SUMMARY
Analysis of slbo mutant border and centripetal migratory cells in the ovary. SLBO, a C/EBP family transcriptional activator, is required for the switch from stationary to migratory behavior. Results identify genes involved in cell migration and downstream targets of SLBO.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL72 : [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
