TITLE
Fasting effect on vanin-1 depleted liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from vanin-1 KOs fasted for 24 hrs. Vanin-1 is highly expressed in liver compared to other tissues. In the fasted state, liver switches to fatty acid oxidation and glucose production. Results provide insight into the role of vanin-1 in hepatic lipid metabolism during starvation.
