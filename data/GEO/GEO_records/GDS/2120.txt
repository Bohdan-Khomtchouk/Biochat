TITLE
Dominant negative thyroid hormone receptor overexpression effect on hind limb muscle development

SUMMARY
Analysis of hind limbs of premetamorphic (NF55) and postmetamorphic (NF66) transgenics 2 or 6 weeks following transcriptional induction of a dominant negative thyroid hormone (TH) receptor transgene. Results provide insight into the role of TH in the maintenance of limb muscle during development.
