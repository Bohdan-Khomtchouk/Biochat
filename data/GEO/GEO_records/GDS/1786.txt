TITLE
Microarray-assisted positional cloning of TOM-1 and UNC-43

SUMMARY
Analysis of tom-1 and unc-43 mutants. Many mutations found in screens are nonsense mutations which give rise to rapidly-degraded mRNAs, thus making them detectable by microarray. Results support the use of arrays to facilitate identification of mutations from genetic screens.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

PLATFORM
GPL200 : [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
