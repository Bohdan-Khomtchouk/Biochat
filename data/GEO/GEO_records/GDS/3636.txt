TITLE
Matricellular glycoprotein SPARC deficiency effect on lens epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of lens epithelia from animals lacking SPARC. SPARC is a matricellular glycoprotein involved in regulation of extracellular matrix, growth factors, adhesion, and migration. Results provide insight into the function of SPARC in the lens.
