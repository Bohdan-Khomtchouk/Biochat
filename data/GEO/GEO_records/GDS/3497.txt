TITLE
Interleukin-12 effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with interleukin-12 (IL-12). PBMCs obtained from 7 donors. IL-12 plays a central role in adaptive and innate immunity. Results provide further insight into the effects of IL-12 on the immune response.
