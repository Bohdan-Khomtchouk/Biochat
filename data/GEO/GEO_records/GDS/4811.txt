TITLE
GPR120-deficient white adipose tissue response to a high fat diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissues (WAT) of GPR120 null mutants fed a high fat diet (HFD). GPR120-deficient animals on a HFD develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the metabolic changes in WAT of GPR120-deficient mice.
