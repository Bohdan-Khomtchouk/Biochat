TITLE
Parkinson's disease: substantia nigra (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of medial and lateral substantia nigras (SNs) from post-mortem brain samples obtained from individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). The SN exhibits extensive tissue damage in PD. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD.
