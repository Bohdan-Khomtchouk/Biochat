TITLE
BET inhibitor I-BET726 effect on MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line CHP-212: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of CHP-212 neuroblastoma (NB) cells treated with 0.1 or 1 uM I-BET726, a BET inhibitor. MYCN is amplified in CHP-212. BET inhibitors display anti-proliferative activity in MYC driven hematologic cancer models. Results provide insight into the anti-proliferative activity of I-BET726 in NB.
