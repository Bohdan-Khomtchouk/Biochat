TITLE
Neocortical and cerebellar astrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of neocortical and cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures generated from postnatal day 1, wild-type (ICR) pups. Results provide insight into the molecular heterogeneity of astrocyte populations from different brain regions and its relevance to brain tumor formation.
