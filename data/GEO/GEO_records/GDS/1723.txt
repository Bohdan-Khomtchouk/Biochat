TITLE
Abscisic acid effect on small GTPase rop10-1 mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of small GTPase rop10-1 knockout mutant seedlings following treatment with 1 uM abscisic acid (ABA). ROP10 is involved in the negative regulation of ABA responses. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the ROP10-mediated ABA signaling network.
