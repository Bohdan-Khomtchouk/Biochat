TITLE
Transcription factor MIST1-null and MIST1-induced pancreas

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas from C57BL/6 adults with Mist1-null phenotype rescued by tamoxifen-induced Mist1 expression. Embryonic knockout of Mist1 leads to acinar cell dysfunction, disrupting pancreatic function. Results provide insight into the role of Mist1 in regulating mature acinar properties.
