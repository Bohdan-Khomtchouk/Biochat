TITLE
Galectin-1 maturative effect on monocyte-derived dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells induced to mature with galectin-1, a member of the beta-galactoside-binding lectin family that binds to cell surface glyconjugates. Results provide insight into the role of galectin-1 in the immunobiology of dendritic cells.
