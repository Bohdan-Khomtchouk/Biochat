TITLE
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine effect on oral cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines: OC3, SAS, SCC-15, and HSC3, treated with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (AzC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. Results provide insight into potential tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation in OSCC.
