TITLE
Quercetin effect on hepatic cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase null mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase (POR) null mutants at 24 hours following consumption of anti-carcinogenic flavonoid, quercetin. Results identify a diminished transcriptomic response in KO compared to WT in all tissues examined and provide insight into the bioactive nature of quercetin.
