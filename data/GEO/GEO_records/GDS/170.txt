TITLE
Tumor suppressor protein p53 gene dosage effects

SUMMARY
Analysis of tumor suppressor protein p53 gene dosage effects in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma-derived cell lines p53 -/-, +/- and +/+ at 0 and 12 hours. Cells with different numbers of functional TP53 alleles can be distinguished by gene expression profile.

Yoon H, Liyanarachchi S, Wright FA, Davuluri R et al. Gene expression profiling of isogenic cells with different TP53 gene dosage reveals numerous genes that are affected by TP53 dosage and identifies CSPG2 as a direct target of p53.
