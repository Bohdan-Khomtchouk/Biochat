TITLE
Type 2 diabetes and role of hepatokines

SUMMARY
Analysis of percutaneous needle liver biopsies from 10 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 7 normal subjects. The liver has a central role in glucose homeostasis and is a major site of secretory protein production. Results provide insight into the role of hepatokines in T2D insulin resistance.
