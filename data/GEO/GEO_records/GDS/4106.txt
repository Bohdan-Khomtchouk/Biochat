TITLE
Transforming growth factor beta effect on Panc-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Panc-1 cells treated with TGFβ to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. During EMT, cancer cells lose epithelial specific proteins and gain mesenchymal proteins to acquire migratory/invasive phenotype essential for metastasis. Results provide insight into molecular basis of EMT.
