TITLE
Neonatal stress and morphine effects on right hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of postnatal day 9, C57BL/6 males exposed to mild or severe stress and morphine. Morphine is often prescribed to ameliorate preterm infant pain and stress. Results provide insight into dose-dependent, stress-related changes altered by morphine that may affect neurodevelopment.
