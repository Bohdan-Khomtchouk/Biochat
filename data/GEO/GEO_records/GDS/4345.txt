TITLE
Quadriceps muscle from cancer patients before and after surgery: sequential biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of paired muscle biopsies (i.e., pre-resection baseline and 8 month post-resection follow-up, disease-free/weight-stable for previous 2 months) from upper gastrointestinal cancer patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cancer-associated muscle wasting.
