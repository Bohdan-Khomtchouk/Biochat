TITLE
Sickle cell anemia model: brain response to naloxone

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of NY1DD transgenic animals treated with naloxone. The NY1DD strain is a model for sickle cell anemia. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that possesses potent analgesic activity in NY1DD animals. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of naloxone in this model.
