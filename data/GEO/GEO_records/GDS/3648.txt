TITLE
Cardiomyocyte response to various types of fatty acids in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cardiomyocytes treated with 0.4 mM octanoate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, or linoleate for 24 hours. Studies suggest that distinct fatty acid species are cardiotoxic, while others are cardioprotective. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of these effects on the heart.
