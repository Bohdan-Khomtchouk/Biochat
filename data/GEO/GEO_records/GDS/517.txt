TITLE
YODA MAPKK kinase characterization

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in vegetative rosettes of wild type and yda-2 (YODA MAPKK kinase) plants. YODA promotes extra-embryonic cell fates in basal lineage. Results suggest YODA is involved with a novel developmental signal transduction pathway.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
