TITLE
pH1N1 influenza virus infection of interferon regulatory factor 7-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs isolated from an IRF7-deficient patient and infected with influenza A/CA/4/2009 for up to 16 hrs. Transcription factor IRF7 amplifies type I and III interferon response to viruses. Results provide insight into the role of IRF7 in antiviral immunity.
