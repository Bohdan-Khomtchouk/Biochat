TITLE
Pneumococcal polysaccharide serotype 3-lipopolysaccharide co-immunization effect on pneumonia infection: lung

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of lung from Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (ST 3)-infected BALB/c females with prior co-immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide ST 3 and lipopolysaccharide. Results provide sight into molecular basis of attenuation of pneumonia severity by PPS3+LPS co-immunization.
