TITLE
Polyubiquitin knockout effect on testis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of testes from Ubb knockouts at 7 to 28 days postpartum (dpp). Loss of Ubb leads to infertility, with germ cells arrested at meiotic prophase I. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian fertility.
