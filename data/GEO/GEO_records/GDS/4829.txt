TITLE
VprBP depletion effect on prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of DU145 prostate cancer cells depleted for Vpr binding protein (VPRBP). VPRBP knockdown decreases histone H2A threonine 120 (H2AT120) phosphorylation and impairs the viability of DU145 cells. Results provide insight into the role of VprBP in regulating gene transcription.
