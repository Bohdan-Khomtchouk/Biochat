TITLE
Wilson's disease model: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B null animals. Genetic inactivation of ATP7B causes Wilson’s Disease (WD), a severe metabolic disorder associated with intracellular copper overload. Results provide insight into the initial events of copper-dependent liver pathology in WD.
