TITLE
Huntington's disease transgenic model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of R6/1 transgenic animals at 18 to 27 weeks of age. The R6/1 transgenic animal expresses exon 1 of the mutant human huntingtin gene that contains 115 CAG trinucleotide repeats. Results provide insight into the early pathogenesis of HD.
