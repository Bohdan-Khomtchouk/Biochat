TITLE
Androgen effect on runt-related transcription factor 1-deficient prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer (PC) LNCaP cells depleted for runt-related transcription factor (RUNX1) by siRUNX1 transfection then treated with 10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Results provide insight into the role of RUNX1 in AR-dependent PC.
