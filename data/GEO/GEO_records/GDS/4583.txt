TITLE
Leukemia inhibitory factor neutralization effect on E. coli pneumonia lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from C57BL/6 animals during E. coli pneumonia in the presence of neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) antibody. Anti-LIF exacerbates lung injury. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of pneumonia.
