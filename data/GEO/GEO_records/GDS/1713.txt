TITLE
Ewing family tumor and neuroblastoma comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ewing family tumor (EFT) and neuroblastoma (NB) samples. Distinguishing EFTs from other small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs), such as NBs, by histologic methods is often difficult. Results identify EF-associated genes that enable molecular discrimination between EFTs and other SRBCTs.
