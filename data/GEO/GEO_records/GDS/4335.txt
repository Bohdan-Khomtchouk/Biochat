TITLE
Sox9+ pancreatic cells: developmental time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of GFP positive cells from Sox9-EGFP pancreas isolated by FACS at various developmental stages: e10.5, e15.5, p23. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying differentiatiation of Sox9+ embryonic pancreatic progenitors into adult ductal cells or the endocrine lineage.
