TITLE
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 α knockdown in acute myeloid leukemia  cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of AML cell lines infected with shRNAs against glycogen synthase kinase 3 α and β isoforms (GSK-3α, GSK-3β). GSK-3 is a multifunctional serine threonine kinase; specific loss of GSK-3α induces differentiation in AML. Results provide insight into the role of GSK-3α in AML.
