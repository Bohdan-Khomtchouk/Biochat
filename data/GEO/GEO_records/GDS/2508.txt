TITLE
DNA damage effect

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells exposed to the radiomimetic enediyne antibiotics calicheamicin, esperamicin A1, and neocarzinostatin. These enediynes bind specifically to DNA and generate single- and double-strand DNA breaks. Results provide insight into the response to DNA damage.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

PLATFORM
