TITLE
Endotoxin effect on leukocytes: time course (U133 2.0)

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukocytes from 6 healthy subjects intravenously administered bacterial endotoxin. Leukocytes examined at various time points up to 6 hours post-infusion. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the propagation and resolution of the inflammatory response.
