TITLE
Vincristine-sensitive and resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of the vincristine-sensitive SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cell line and its vincristine-resistant derivative. Vincristine is a chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of cancer. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of multidrug resistance.
