TITLE
Adenovirus vector effect on complement system deficient mutant livers

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from complement-deficient C3 knockout mutants injected with a first generation LacZ adenovirus (Ad) vector. Ad vectors are used in gene delivery. Results provide insight into the role of the complement system in elaborating multiple Ad-associated acute inflammatory responses.
