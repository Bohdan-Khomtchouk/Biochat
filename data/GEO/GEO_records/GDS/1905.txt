TITLE
Ovarian germ line stem cells expanded by Dpp overexpression and bam mutation

SUMMARY
Analysis of purified ovarian germ line stem cells (GSCs) expanded by overexpression of the bone morphogenetic protein Dpp or by mutating the bam gene. Kc tissue culture cells also examined. Dpp represses bam transcription. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of GSC maintenance and function.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
