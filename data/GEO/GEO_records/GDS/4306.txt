TITLE
DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 knockout effect on leukemia stem cells and bulk leukemia cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Dnmt1 haploinsufficient leukemia stem cells (leukemic granulocytemacrophage progenitors; L-GMPs) and bulk leukemia cells from a model of MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dnmt1 haploinsufficiency delays progression of AML. Results provide insight into role of Dnmt1 in AML.
