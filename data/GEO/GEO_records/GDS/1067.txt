TITLE
Plasma cell dyscrasias

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of plasma cells from patients with plasma cell dyscrasias:  7 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, 39 with multiple myeloma (MM), and 6 with plasma cell leukemia.  Results provide insight into the neoplastic transformation of plasma cells in MM.
