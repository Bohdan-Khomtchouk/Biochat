TITLE
Post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of right lung medial lobe, right lung cardiac lobe, and whole right lung following left pneumonectomy. Surgical resection of pulmonary tissue triggers a proregenerative stretch stimulus in the remaining lung. Results provide insight into molecular basis of stretch-induced lung regeneration.
