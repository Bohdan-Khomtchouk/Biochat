TITLE
Wing imaginal disc spatial gene expression

SUMMARY
Discovery of genes with restricted expression patterns in wing disc and potential roles in wing disc development. Wing imaginal discs dissected to generate body wall and wing/hinge fragments. Three biological replicates of each examined.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL72 : [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
