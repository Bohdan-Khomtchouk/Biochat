TITLE
Cell cycle of T98G glioblastoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of T98G cells in asynchronously growing state, after 72 hr of serum starvation to induce G0, or after serum restimulation to enter cell cycle. Results provide insight into mammalian cell-cycle gene regulation and mechanisms underlying repression of cell cycle dependent genes in quiescence.
