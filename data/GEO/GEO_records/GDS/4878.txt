TITLE
c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 deletion effect on bile duct ligation model of liver fibrosis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 null (Jnk1-/-) and hepatocyte-specific, JNK1 null (Jnk1Δhepa) males subjected to BDL for up to 28 days to induce liver fibrosis. Liver injury activates Jnk members of the MAPK family. Results provide insight into the role of Jnk1 in liver fibrosis.
