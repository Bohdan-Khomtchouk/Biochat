TITLE
Gonadal somatic cells during the critical period of sex determination: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonadal somatic cells from male and female embryos at 10.5 and 11.5 days post coitum (dpc), which span the critical period of male sex determination. Results provide insight into sex determination and gonad differentiation, and identify candidate genes for sexual dysgenesis syndromes.
