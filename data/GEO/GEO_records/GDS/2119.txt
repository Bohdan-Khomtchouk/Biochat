TITLE
Adjudin effect on the testis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of testis from Sprague-Dawleys 8 hours or 4 days after Adjudin treatment. Adjudin targets the Sertoli-germ cell adherens junction and causes germ cell depletion from the seminiferous epithelium. Results provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate junction restructuring in the testis.
