TITLE
High fat diet effect on liver depleted of promyelocytic leukemia gene

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from promyelocytic leukemia (Pml)-knockouts fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 20 wks. The increased predisposition of Pml-KOs to HFD-induced obesity is associated with aspects of metabolic syndrome. Results provide insight into molecular basis of a metabolic prosurvival role for PML.
