TITLE
Embryonic development of male reproductive tract tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of efferent ducts, epididymis, and vas deferens of CD1 males from embryonic day 14 to postnatal day 1. Proper development of these tissues is essential for fertility. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific regulation in organ morphogenesis.
