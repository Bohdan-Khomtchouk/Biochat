TITLE
Dendritic cell development in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cell (DC) development from Flt3(+)CD11b(+) DC progenitors. DC progenitors treated with GM-CSF for 7 and 10 days to induce differentiation. DCs differentiated for 10 days were subsequently treated with TNFalpha to induce maturation.
