TITLE
Phf19 depletion effect on embryonic carcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of F9 embryonic carcinoma cells depleted for Phf19, a PRC2 associated protein. PRC2 regulates pluripotency, differentiation, and tumorigenesis by catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Results provide insight into the role of Phf19 in regulating PRC2 function.
