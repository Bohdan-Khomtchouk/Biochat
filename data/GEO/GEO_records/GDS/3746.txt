TITLE
Cigarette smoke effect on tracheal explants

SUMMARY
Analysis of tracheal explants at 2hrs and 24hrs following brief exposure to whole smoke. Some of the explants were pretreated with dexamethasone prior to smoke exposure. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced small airway remodeling.
