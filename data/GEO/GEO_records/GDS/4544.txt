TITLE
G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 inhibition effect on HEK cells in vitro and in vivo

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK cells expressing dominant-negative GRK2-K220R. HEK cells were cultured, or expanded in NOD.Scid mice, or re-cultured after NOD.Scid expansion. GRK2-K220R enhances growth of NOD.Scid HEK cells but not cultured HEK cells. Results provide insight into basis of growth control by GRK2.
