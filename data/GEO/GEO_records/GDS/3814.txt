TITLE
Fetal and adult reticulocytes

SUMMARY
Comparison of reticulocytes from adult peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood. Hemoglobin (Hb) composition switches around the time of birth from fetal Hb to adult Hb. Together with microRNA profiling, results provide insight into the role of microRNAs in fetal-to-adult Hb switching.
