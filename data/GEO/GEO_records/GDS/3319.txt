SUMMARY
Analysis of 2, 6, and 10 month old transgenic (Tg) thyroids expressing RET/PTC3 fusion gene or E7 human papillomavirus 16 oncoprotein. The two Tg populations with different initiating mutations both develop thyroid carcinoma. Results provide insight into the different steps leading to carcinoma.
