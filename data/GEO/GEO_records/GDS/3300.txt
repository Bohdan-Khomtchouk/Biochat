TITLE
SOX transcription factor overexpression in embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CA1 and CA2 embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines over-expressing transcription factor SOX7 or SOX17, producing extraembryonic endoderm and definitive endoderm progenitors, respectively. Results provide insight into the roles of SOX7 and SOX17 as regulators of endoderm differentiation in ESCs.
