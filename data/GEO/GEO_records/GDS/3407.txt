TITLE
Perfluorooctanoic acid effect on livers lacking PPAR-alpha

SUMMARY
Analysis of PPAR-alpha null livers from animals treated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a member of a class of industrial chemicals called peroxisome proliferator chemicals. PFOA exposure is linked to cancer. Results provide insight into the role of PPAR-alpha in mediating the effects of PFOA.
