TITLE
MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line  transfected with miR-221/222 mimic

SUMMARY
Analysis MCF10A cells transfected with synthetic oligo mimics for microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-221 and miR-222. Both miRNAs are abundant in the basal-like subtype of breast cancer but not in the luminal subtype. Results provide insight in to the role of miR-221/222 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.
