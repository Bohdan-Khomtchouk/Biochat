TITLE
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscle from 12 patients with various forms of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations: 8 patients with a A3243G mutation, and 4 patients with a 4977 base pair deletion. Results identify possible expression signature for mitochondrial disorders.
