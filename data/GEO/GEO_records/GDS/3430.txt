TITLE
Dicer deficient embryonic stem cell response to miR-290 transfection

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated Dicer deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells transfected with the siRNA-like form of miRNAs of the miR-290 cluster. Loss of miRNA pathway components negatively affects ES cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of miR-290 in ES cell differentiation.
