TITLE
Hair follicle development: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of back skin excised from CB6F1 animals at various ages up to 1 year.  Difference between synchronously and asynchronously growing hair used to identify hair cycle genes.  Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating hair follicle morphogenesis.
