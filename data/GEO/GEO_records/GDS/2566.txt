TITLE
Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane effect on hearts: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts exposed to the heart toxin bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane (CEM) for 2 or 5 days. Toxicity occurs at day 2 of CEM dosing, and recovery at day 5 despite continued dosing. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of heart toxicity and recovery during the exposure to CEM.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL890 : Agilent-011868 Rat Oligo Microarray G4130A (Feature Number version)
