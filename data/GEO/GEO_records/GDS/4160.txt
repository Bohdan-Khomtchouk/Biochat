TITLE
Hepatitis C Virus infection effect on Huh7 hepatoma cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Huh7 hepatoma cells infected with JFH-1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours post-infection. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms that contribute to HCV-associated liver pathogenesis.
