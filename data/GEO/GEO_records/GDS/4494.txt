TITLE
Segmental monosomy

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult females representing segmental deficiencies (Df), both as single Df/+ genotypes and in pairwise Df combinations. Aneuploidies such as segmental monosomy are associated with developmental abnormalities. Results provide insight into the effects of aneuploidies on the transcriptome.
