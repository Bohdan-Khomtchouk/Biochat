TITLE
Nephrogenesis: embryonic kidney segments

SUMMARY
Spatial and temporal analysis of laser capture microdissected wild-type, CD1 embryonic kidney sections across 3 developmental time points (E11.5, E12.5, E15.5) representing early stages of nephron formation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the stages of nephrogenesis.
