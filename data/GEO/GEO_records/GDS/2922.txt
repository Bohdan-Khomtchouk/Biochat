TITLE
Ascending aortic aneurysms

SUMMARY
Analysis of aneurysmal tissue from ascending aortas of patients with normal tricuspid aortic valves or abnormal bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). BAV is a congenital anomaly associated with an increased risk for ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAAs). Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of AscAA.
