TITLE
Effect of lifestyle on Moroccan Amazighs: peripheral blood leukocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukocytes from regionally distinct groups of Moroccan Amazighs leading diverse lifestyles: nomadic, rural, and urban. The Amazighs represent a genetically relatively homogeneous population. Results provide insight into effect of environment on immune function and disease susceptibility.
