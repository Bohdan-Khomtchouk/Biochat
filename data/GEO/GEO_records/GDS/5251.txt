TITLE
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin stimulation effect on hepatic stellate cells: time course (experiment 2)

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) cultured with LPS for 1 and 24 hr. During exposure to toxins such as LPS, the liver suffers inflammatory injury. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic inflammatory and immune responses.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
