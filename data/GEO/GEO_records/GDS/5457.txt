TITLE
Onecut2 deficiency effect on adult retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult retinas from onecut2 (OC2) knockouts and wild type littermates. OC2 is a member of the Onecut family of transcription factors characterized by a cut domain and an atypical homeodomain. Results provide insight into the role of OC2 in the retina.
