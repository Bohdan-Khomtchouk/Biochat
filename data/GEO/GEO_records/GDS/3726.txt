TITLE
Oxidative stress-vulnerable and -resistant neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of neurons from 4 brain regions: hippocampal CA1 and CA3, cerebellar CbG, and cerebral cortex. CA1 and CbG neurons are vulnerable to oxidative stress (OS), CA3 and cerebral cortex neurons resistant. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for selective neuronal vulnerability to OS.
