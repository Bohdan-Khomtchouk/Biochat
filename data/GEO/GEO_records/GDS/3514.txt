TITLE
Liposarcoma response to doxorubicin in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of various types of liposarcomas treated with doxorubicin in vitro. While doxorubicin is an established chemotherapeutic for treating liposarcomas, the response to this drug is low. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the resistance of liposarcomas to doxorubicin.
