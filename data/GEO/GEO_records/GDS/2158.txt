TITLE
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy model: regenerating skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of regenerating gastrocnemius muscles of emerin and lamin A/C knockout mutants at various time points up to 4 days following treatment with cardiotoxin to induce muscle injury. Mutations in emerin and lamin A/C cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
