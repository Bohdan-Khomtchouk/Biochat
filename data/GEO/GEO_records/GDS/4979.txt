TITLE
Lapatinib effect on lapatinib-resistant ErbB2-positive cell line: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of lapatinib-resistant ErbB2-positive cells treated with 0.1 or 1 uM lapatinib. Lapatinib is an EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor used to treat ErbB2‐positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of resistance to lapatinib.
