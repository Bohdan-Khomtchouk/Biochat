TITLE
Dilated cardiomyopathy: septum

SUMMARY
Comparison of septal myocardial tissue samples from 13 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) to those from 15 patients with non-failing (NF) hearts. DCM is a common cause of heart failure. Results contribute to the identification of a gene expression signature for DCM.
