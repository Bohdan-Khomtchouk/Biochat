TITLE
Brassinazole effect on arf2 mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of etiolated, auxin response factor 2 (arf2) mutant seedlings grown on brassinazole, a type of brassinosteroid hormone (BR). ARF2 is required for normal BR response. Results provide insight into the convergence of the brassinosteroid and auxin signalling pathways at the molecular level.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
