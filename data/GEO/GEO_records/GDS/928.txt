TITLE
Osteoblasts and microgravity-induced bone loss

SUMMARY
Identification of gravisensitive gene expression in 2T3 pre-osteoblast cells exposed to 3 days of simulated microgravity. Microgravity causes bone loss possibly due to decreased bone formation by osteoblasts. Results provide insight into similar pathologic conditions such as osteoporosis.
