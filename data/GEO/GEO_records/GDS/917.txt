TITLE
Whole blood RNA isolation and leukocyte RNA purification: comparison of methods

SUMMARY
Comparison of RNA isolation from whole blood using the PAXgene system to that from leukocytes using the buffy coat procedure.  Blood of healthy subjects and trauma patients examined.  Results indicate that RNA isolated from whole blood produced more noise than that from leukocytes.
