TITLE
Mammary epithelial cell response to genistein and soy proteins

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary epithelial cells of females fed a diet containing the soy isoflavone genistein or soy protein isolate. Soy consumption is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the beneficial effect of soy-rich diets.
