TITLE
Dopaminergic transcription factors Ascl1, Lmx1a, Nurr1 combined  effect on embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons generated from  E14.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) reprogrammed by infection with lentiviruses expressing dopaminergic transcription factors Ascl1, Lmx1a and Nurr1. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of MEF to iDA reprogramming.
