TITLE
LIM homeobox Lhx8 deficiency effect on newborn ovaries

SUMMARY
Wild type newborn ovary RNA was compared to newborn ovary RNA from Lhx8 deficient (-/-) or Nobox deficient (-/-) mice. Results indicate that Lxh8 is a critical factor for maintenance and differentiation of ooyctes during early embryogenesis and it acts in part by down-regulating the Nobox pathway.
