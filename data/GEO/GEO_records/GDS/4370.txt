TITLE
Effect of macrophage-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma deficiency on induced inflammatory bowel disease

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon from macrophage PPARγ-deficient C57BL/6 mice and control littermates following dextran sulfate sodium challenge to induce colitis. Deficiency of PPARγ in macrophages worsens colitis severity. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the effects of macrophage PPARγ in IBD.
