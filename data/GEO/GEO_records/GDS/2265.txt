TITLE
Pyruvate effect on muscle cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 myoblasts treated with supraphysiological levels of sodium pyruvate for 72 hours. Pyruvate increases mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle myoblasts. Results provide insight into the impact of altering energy provision on mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
