TITLE
Primary hepatocyte response to interferon-α or interleukin 28B: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary hepatocytes up to 24 hrs after treatment with cytokines: interferon (IFN)-α or interleukin 28B (IL28B, a type III IFN). Members of type III IFN system possess antiviral activities against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Results provide insight into role of III IFNs in HCV infection.
