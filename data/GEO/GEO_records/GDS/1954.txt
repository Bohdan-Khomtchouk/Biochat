TITLE
Various T7 RNA polymerase-based RNA amplification/labeling methods

SUMMARY
Comparison of expression profiles generated using various T7 RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription (IVT) RNA labeling methods. The length of the IVT reactions ranged from 4 to 16 hours. Results provide evidence for amplification method-dependent biases in gene expression data.
