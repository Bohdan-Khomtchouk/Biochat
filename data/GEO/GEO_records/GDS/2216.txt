TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide antagonist effect on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated dendritic cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells treated with cyanobacterial product (CyP) for 1 or 3 hours, or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of CyP for 3 hours. Results provide insight into the extent of the antagonistic activity of CyP on LPS-induced responses.
