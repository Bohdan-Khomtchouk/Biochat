TITLE
Torcetrapib effect on adrenal carcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of H295 adrenal carcinoma cells treated with torcetrapib, an anti-cholesterol drug. Adverse side effects of torcetrapib treatment include changes in blood pressure, potassium, sodium, and aldosterone. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the off-target side effects.
