TITLE
Breast cancer cells reexpressing estrogen receptor alpha response to 17beta-estradiol

SUMMARY
Analysis of the response of estrogen receptor (ER) negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells infected with full-length ER alpha adenoviral constructs to treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2). Results provide insight into the anti-proliferative effect of E2 on breast cancer cells reexpressing ER.
