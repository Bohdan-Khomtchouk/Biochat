TITLE
First-time acute myocardial infarction patients with or without recurrent event: peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood from first-time acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, clinically indistinguishable at baseline, with or without recurrent cardiovascular events at 18 months. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms distinguishing AMI patients with or without recurrent events.
