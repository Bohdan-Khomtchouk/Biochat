TITLE
Estrogen effect on estrogen receptors alpha and beta single knockouts: aorta

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor alpha or beta null aortas of ovariectomized animals treated with estrogen. Estrogen is important in vascular tone regulation and in cardiovascular disease pathophysiology. Results provide insight into the mechanisms mediating the effects of estrogen in blood vessels.
