TITLE
Male germ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of four spermatic subpopulations: type A and type B spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. The X and Y chromosomes are subject to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in the mammalian male germline. Results provide insight into the extent of postmeiotic X silencing.
