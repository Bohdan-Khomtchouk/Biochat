TITLE
T cell leukemia cell response to human herpesvirus 6 infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of an adult T cell leukemia cell line (TaY) following infection with human herpesvirus type 6B strain OK. Cells examined up to 5 days post-infection. Chronically-infected TaY cells were also examined. Results identify candidate genes that regulate the immune response during viral infection.
