TITLE
Organized and growth-arrested mammary acini: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of two nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) grown in a laminin-rich extracellular matrix. Both HMECs transit from a disorganized to an organized state to form polarized acini. Results identify gene signatures with potential value for breast cancer prognosis prediction.
