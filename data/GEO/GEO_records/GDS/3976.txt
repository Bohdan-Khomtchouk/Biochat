TITLE
Premature Hematopoietic Aging model: bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from mid-aged mutator females that express a proofreading-defective form of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying multiple aspects of aging accelerated in the mutator model.
