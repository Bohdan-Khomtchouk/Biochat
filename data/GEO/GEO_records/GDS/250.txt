TITLE
Alveoli septation inhibition and protection

SUMMARY
Analysis of how dexamethasone (DEX) inhibits normal lung septation and alveoli formation, and mechanism by which retinoic acid (ATRA) protects against DEX. Three day old mice treated with ATRA or control. On day 4, half of each group administered DEX.
