TITLE
Estrogen receptor alpha-silenced MCF7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 breast cancer cells after siRNA-mediated silencing of the estrogen receptor α (ERα). The induced ERα silencing resulted in estrogen/tamoxifen resistant cells (pII). Results provide insight into molecular events underlying the endocrine drug resistant phenotype in breast cancer.
