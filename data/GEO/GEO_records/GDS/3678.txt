TITLE
Saturated fatty acid rich diet effect on risk of metabolic syndrome: adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose tissue from moderately overweight subjects who consumed a saturated fat (SFA)-rich diet for 2 weeks, followed by SFA or monounsaturated (MUFA)-rich intervention diets for 8 weeks. Results provide insight into role of dietary fat on the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.
