TITLE
DSS-induced colitis model response to enhanced siRNA targeting of Tumor necrosis factor α

SUMMARY
Analysis of distal colon from dextran sulfate sodium-treated C57BL/6 females after administration of chemically modified siRNA against TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results provide insight into functionally enhanced siRNA targeting of TNFα in IBD.
