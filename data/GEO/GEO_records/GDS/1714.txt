TITLE
Bleomycin effect on mutagen-sensitive lymphoblastoid cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutagen-sensitive lymphoblastoid cell lines after exposure to bleomycin. Mutagen-sensitive cells exhibit a high number of bleomycin-induced chromatid breaks. Mutagen sensitivity (MS) reflects an individual's susceptibility to sporadic cancers. Results identify genes involved in MS.
