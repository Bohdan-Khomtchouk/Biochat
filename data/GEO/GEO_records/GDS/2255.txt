TITLE
Transmigrated neutrophils in the alveolar space of endotoxin-exposed lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of neutrophils that transmigrate to the alveolar space. Transmigration induced by bronchoscopic instillation of volunteers with endotoxin (LPS). Results identify differences between pulmonary and circulating neutrophils that occur early in endotoxin-induced lung inflammation.
