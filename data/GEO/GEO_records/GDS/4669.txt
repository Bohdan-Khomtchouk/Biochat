TITLE
Central nervous system cell types derived from UNC-93B-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of neurons and astrocytes derived from UNC-93B-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells (UNC93B-/- iPS) and from hESCs (H9). UNC-93B-/- neurons are highly susceptible to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Results provide insight into role of neurons in anti-HSV-1 immunity in the CNS.
