TITLE
Type 2 diabetes susceptibility: role of hepatic lipogenic capacity

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic islets from non-diabetic (C57BL/6J (B6)) and severely diabetic (BTBR) strains of obese (ob/ob), 14 week old males.  Results correlate increased hepatic lipogenic gene expression in B6-ob/ob with type 2 diabetes resistance.
