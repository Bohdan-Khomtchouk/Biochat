TITLE
Interleukin-10 deficiency model of inflammatory bowel disease

SUMMARY
Analysis of colons of C3H/HeJBir and C57BL/6J strains following interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene disruption. IL-10 disruption leads to colitis in C3H/HeJBir strain but not in C57BL/6J. Results used to reduce the number of candidate genes associated with colitogenic quantitative trait loci regions.
