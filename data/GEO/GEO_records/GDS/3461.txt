TITLE
microRNA-140 overexpression effect on fibroblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells following microRNA-140 overexpression. MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of mRNAs. Results identify gene targets of microRNA-140.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
