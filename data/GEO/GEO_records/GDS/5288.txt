TITLE
PTPN1 depletion effect on Hodgkin lymphoma derived cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of KM-H2 Hodgkin lymphoma derived cells depleted for PTPN1. PTPN1 encodes PTP1B, a non-receptor-type member of the superfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Results provide insight into the role of PTPN1 mutations in lymphomagenesis.
