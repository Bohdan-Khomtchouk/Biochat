TITLE
Monoclonal gammopathies: bone marrow plasma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of plasma cells from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (MM), or MM. MM is consistently preceded by MGUS/SMM. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the transformation from precursor disease to MM.
