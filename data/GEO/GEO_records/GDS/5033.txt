TITLE
Diencephalon response to short-term dietary zinc deficiency followed by zinc recovery

SUMMARY
Analysis of diencephalon from Sprague-Dawley males fed a zinc-deficient diet for 10 days then a control diet for 6 days. The zinc recovery restored food intake behaviors and salt preferences. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of short-term zinc deficiency and recovery on the brain.
