TITLE
Arsenic effect on lung epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells treated with 2.5 uM arsenic trioxide for 6 months. Chronic arsenic exposure increases lung cancer risk. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung carcinogenesis associated with arsenic exposure.
