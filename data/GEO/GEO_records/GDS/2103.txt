TITLE
Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer model

SUMMARY
Analysis of cancerous stomach tissues of human gastrin overexpressing transgenic animals 6 months following infection with Helicobacter felis. Gastrin overexpression and H. felis infection synergistically accelerate gastric cancer in this model. Results identify gastric cancer-specific genes.
