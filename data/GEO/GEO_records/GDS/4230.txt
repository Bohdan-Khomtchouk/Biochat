TITLE
Pathogenic Simian Immunodeficiency Virus infection in Rhesus macaques: colorectal tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of colorectal biopsies from SIV-infected Rhesus macaques (RM) and Sooty mangabeys (SM). Unlike AIDS-susceptible RMs, natural hosts such as SMs do not progress to AIDS. Results provide insight into molecular basis of immune activation following pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infections.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta
