TITLE
E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 depletion effect on SF539 glioma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of SF539 glioma cells depleted for PARK2.  PARK2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Results provide insight into the role of PARK2 in the coordinate control of cyclins in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression.
