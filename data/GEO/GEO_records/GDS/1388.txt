TITLE
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary lymphocytes from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. Lymphocytes from patients with indolent B-CLL compared to those with progressive B-CLL. Results identify putative gene markers of B-CLL progression from a stable to an aggressive state.
