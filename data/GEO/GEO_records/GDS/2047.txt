TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide effect on macrophages pretreated with carbon monoxide: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) for 3 hours and subsequently treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for up to 4 hours. CO suppresses proinflammatory responses elicited by LPS. Results indicate that PPARgamma mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of CO.
