TITLE
Psoriasis: in vitro activated T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of in vitro activated T cells of psoriasis patients which were obtained by treating PBMCs with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Psoriasis is a T cell-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation of skin. Results provide insights into the molecular basis of T cell activation in psoriasis.
