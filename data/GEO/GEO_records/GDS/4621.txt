TITLE
Mutated anaplastic lymphoma kinase-driven neuroblastoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuroblastomas (NB) induced by mutated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALKF1174L), MYCN, or both oncogenes. ALK is a gene normally expressed in the developing nervous system. Results provide insight into the role of mutated ALK in tumorigenesis.
