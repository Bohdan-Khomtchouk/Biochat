TITLE
Transgenic model of selective ATF6 activation: heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart left ventricle from ATF6-MER transgenic (TG) males, treated with tamoxifen to confer activation to ATF6-MER. Activating ATF6 protects the heart of TG animals from endoplasmic reticulum stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this protective effect.
