TITLE
RB1-depleted osteoblast response to ionizing radiation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of RB1-depleted primary osteoblasts exposed to 4 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) for up to 24 hours. IR exposure and germline mutations in RB1 are risk factors for developing osteosarcoma. Results provide insight into the role of RB1 in the response of osteoblasts to IR.
