TITLE
Chloroprene effect on rat lung: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of F344 females exposed to 0 to 200 ppm chloroprene (CR) for 5 or 15 days. CR, a monomer used in the production of neoprene elastomers, generates multiorgan tumors in mouse and rat cancer bioassays. Compared to mice (GDS4847), F344 rats are insensitive to CR-induced lung tumors.
