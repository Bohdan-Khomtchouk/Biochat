TITLE
Histone H2B N-terminal domain mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of histone H2B mutants that have a substitution of all acetylated N-terminal lysine (K) residues with glycine, or a deletion in the N-terminal domain. Results provide insight into the role of the histone NTD and histone lysine acetylation in transcriptional regulation.

ORGANISM
