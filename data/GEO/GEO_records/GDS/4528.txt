TITLE
KrasG12D pancreatic ductal epithelial cells deficient in PTEN

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) established from 6-week-old Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D L/+;Pten L/+ animals. Oncogenic KrasG12D and Pten deficiency cooperate to induce pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Results provide insight into molecular basis of PDAC development.
