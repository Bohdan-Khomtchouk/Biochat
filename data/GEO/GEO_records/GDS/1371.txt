TITLE
Peripheral myelin protein 22 gene dosage and point mutation effect on sciatic nerve

SUMMARY
Analysis of sciatic nerve from postnatal day 4 and 60 mutants overexpressing peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), lacking PMP22, or expressing the Trembler PMP22 point mutation. Results provide insight into normal function of PMP22, myelination, and neuropathies caused by PMP22 misexpression.
