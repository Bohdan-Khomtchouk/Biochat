TITLE
Ultrafine particles effect on ovalbumin-sensitized lungs

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from ovalbumin-sensitized BALB/cJ animals exposed to ultrafine carbon particles (UCP). Ovalbumin-sensitized animals are models for allergic asthma. Results provide insight into the effect of ultrafine particle inhalation on development and progression of allergic asthma.
