TITLE
Mast cell activation via the Fc(epsilon)RI

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells 2 hours post stimulation by high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI). Cells incubated with myeloma IgE and IL-4 prior to stimulation. Cells activated via FcεRI with anti-IgE antibody to induce release of antihistamines and other inflammation mediators.
