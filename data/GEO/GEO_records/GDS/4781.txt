TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv-infected macrophages response to vitamin D

SUMMARY
Analysis of Mtb H37Rv-infected THP-1 macrophages treated with the hormonal form of vitamin D (1,25D). Macrophages are the primary site of Mtb infection and are sites of 1,25D signaling. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the 1,25D-enhanced macrophage response to Mtb infection.
