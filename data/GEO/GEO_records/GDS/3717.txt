TITLE
NOTCH antagonist SAHM1 effect on T-ALL cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of HPB-ALL and KOPT-K1 cells treated with SAHM1, an antagonist of the NOTCH transcription factor. SAHM1 is an alpha-helical hydrocarbon stapled peptide derived from MAML1. Results provide insight into the specificity of the antagonistic effect of SAHM1 on gene expression driven by NOTCH.
