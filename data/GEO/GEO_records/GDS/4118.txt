TITLE
Tumor suppressor PTEN re-expression effect on PTEN-null embryonic fibroblasts: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Pten-null (PtenΔloxp/Δloxp) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying a tet-inducible PTEN transgene, up to 48 hrs after PTEN induction. Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with PTEN loss. Results provide insight into molecular basis of PTEN regulation of CRPC.
