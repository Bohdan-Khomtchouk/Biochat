TITLE
Distal convoluted tubular epithelial cell line response to mineralocorticoid receptor overexpression and aldosterone

SUMMARY
Analysis of distal convoluted tubular epithelial cells overexpressing the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) after treatment with aldosterone alone or together with spironolactone, an MR blocker. MR is a member of the nuclear receptor family and binds aldosterone. Results identify MR gene targets.
