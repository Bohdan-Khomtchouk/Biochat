TITLE
Septic neutrophil response to lipopolysaccharide and high mobility group box 1 protein

SUMMARY
Analysis of septic neutrophils treated with lipopolysaccharide or high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein. Neutrophils isolated from patients with sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). HMGB1 is a late mediator of endotoxin lethality, and neutrophils play a role in endotoxemia-associated ALI.
