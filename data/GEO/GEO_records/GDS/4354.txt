TITLE
Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome bone biopsies: pre- and post-surgery

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone biopsies from Cushing’s syndrome (CS) patients, before and mean 3 months after surgical treatment. Excess GC-induced bone loss is a serious complication in patients with endogenous CS. Results provide insight molecular mechanisms by which excess GCs influence bone metabolism.
