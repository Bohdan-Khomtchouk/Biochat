TITLE
Foxp3 ablation effect on mature regulatory T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mature regulatory T cells (Treg) ablated for the transcription factor Foxp3. Foxp3 is required for the development of Treg cells. Results provide insight into the role of Foxp3 in maintaining the transcriptional and functional program established during Treg cell development.
