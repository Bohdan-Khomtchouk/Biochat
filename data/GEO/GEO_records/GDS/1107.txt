TITLE
Blastocyst response to various MAPK pathway inhibitors  (MOE430A)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of blastocysts following inhibition of JNK, p38 MAPK, or ERK signaling. JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK signaling inhibited by SP600125, SB203580, and U0126 respectively. Results provide insight into the role of MAPK pathways in preimplantation development.
