TITLE
Thymocyte selection by agonist

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD8 alpha beta cells in reaggregation thymic organ culture (RTOC) selected by natural ligands, CD8 alpha beta RTOC cells selected by low-dose agonist (100 nM Smcy), and CD8 alpha alpha RTOC cells selected by high-dose agonist (10 mM Smcy).

ORGANISM
