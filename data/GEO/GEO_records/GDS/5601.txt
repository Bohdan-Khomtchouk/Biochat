TITLE
Nanoemulsion adjuvant W805EC effect on JAWS II dendritic cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of JAWS II DCs incubated with nanoemulsion (NE) adjuvant W805EC for up to 24 hrs. W805EC is an oil-in-water emulsion with nanodroplets similar in size to many viruses infecting the nasal mucosa. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the adjuvant activity of W805EC NE in DCs.
