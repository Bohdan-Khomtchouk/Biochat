TITLE
IFN-gamma primed macrophage response to IFN-gamma restimulation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD14+ monocytes primed with 3 U/ml (subactivating dose) IFN-gamma for 48 hours and restimulated with 100 U/ml (saturating dose) IFN-gamma for various time point up to 24 hours. Results provide insight into the influence of IFN-gamma priming on IFN-gamma induced transcriptional responses.
