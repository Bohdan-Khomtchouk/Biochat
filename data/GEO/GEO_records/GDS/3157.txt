TITLE
Inherited cryptorchidism model: fetal testis

SUMMARY
Analysis of testis of cryptorchid (orl) fetuses at at various gestational days up to GD19. The orl strain is at high risk for cryptorchidism, or undescended testis, one of the most common congenital anomalies in humans. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cryptorchidism.
