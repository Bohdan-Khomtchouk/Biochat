TITLE
Ewing family tumor cells: effect of transfection

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ewing family tumor (EFT) cell line A673 response to interleukin-2 (IL-2) transfection to assess possible undesirable effects (e.g. tumor stimulation) of in vitro manipulation. Results impact the potential use of IL-2 transfection as an in vivo immunotherapy for EFT patients.
