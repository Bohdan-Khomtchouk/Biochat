TITLE
Embryonic motor neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic motor neurons marked with an unc-4::GFP reporter transgene. UNC-4 is a homoedomain transcription factor expressed in 13 embryonic motor neurons. Results contribute to a comprehensive picture of gene expression in a subset of motor neurons.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans
