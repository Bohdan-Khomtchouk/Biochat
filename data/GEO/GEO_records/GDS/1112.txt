TITLE
Glaucomatous astrocytes from the optic nerve head

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of astrocytes taken from the optic nerve head (ONH) of patients with glaucoma. The ONH is the site of damage in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Studies suggest that damage in glaucoma is mediated by reactive astrocytes.
