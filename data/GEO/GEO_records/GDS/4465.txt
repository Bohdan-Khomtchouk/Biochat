TITLE
High grade astrocytoma patient survival: brain tumor

SUMMARY
Analysis of surgical brain tumors from high grade astrocytoma (HGA) patients with known clinical outcomes. Increased expression of immune function-related genes was positively correlated with longer survival. Results provide insight into molecular profiles associated with long-term survival in HGA.
