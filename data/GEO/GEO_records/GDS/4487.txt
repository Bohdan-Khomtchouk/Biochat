TITLE
Ras/MEK inhibition effect on IFN-alpha treated cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HT1080 cells treated with IFN-alpha, the Ras/MEK inhibitor U0126, or both for 6 or 12 hours. SKOV3 cells treated with IFN-alpha for 6 hours examined. HT1080 is moderately resistant to the anti-viral effects of IFN-alpha. MEK inhibition increases the sensitivity of HT1080 to IFN-alpha.
