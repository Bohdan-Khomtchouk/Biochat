TITLE
Phagocytic receptor Eater depleted hemocyte-derived cell line response to phagocytosed bacteria: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of phagocytic receptor Eater depleted hemocyte-derived S2 cells after phagocytosing bacteria for up to 180 minutes. Results provide insight into the role of Eater in the transcriptional regulation of genes that are induced after bacterial binding and phagocytosis.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
