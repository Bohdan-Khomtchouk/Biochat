TITLE
Listeria monocytogenes infection effect on transcriptional repressor BLIMP1-deficient macrophage

SUMMARY
Analysis of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) conditional knockout macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes for 2 hr. Results provide insight into BLIMP1-mediated regulatory mechanisms in macrophages in early host defense against intracellular bacteria.
