TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) activation effect on cultured myotubes

SUMMARY
Analysis of musculus obliquus internus myotubes treated with PPARδ agonist GW501516 for 96hrs. PPARs regulate lipid utilization and storage. PPARδ is the most abundant PPAR subtype in skeletal muscle. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of PPARδ activation on myotubes.
