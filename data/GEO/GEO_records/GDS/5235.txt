TITLE
Lamin A exon 9 deletion effect on fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts from mutants deleted for exon 9 of Lamin A (LMNA). Mutant deleted for exon 9 of LMNA is a model for the segmental premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria (HGPS). Results provide insight into the molecular etiology and pathology of HGPS.
