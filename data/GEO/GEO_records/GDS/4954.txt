TITLE
Cobalt effect on liver cell line MH1C1: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of MH1C1 liver cells exposed to 160 or 310 uM cobalt chloride. Cobalt (Co) is a heavy metal found naturally in low concentrations and used in military and industrial applications. Co exposure can result in adverse health effects. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of Co toxicity.
