TITLE
Transcription factor paired box 3 knockin embryos: palate

SUMMARY
Analysis of E14.5 palatal shelves of knockin mutants expressing developmentally-regulated transcription factor Pax3 beyond the time at which it is normally shut off. Cleft palate observed in newborns persistently expressing Pax3. Results provide insight into the role of Pax3 in palate development.
