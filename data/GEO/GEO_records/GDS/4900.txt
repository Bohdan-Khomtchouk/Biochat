TITLE
Ultrasonic incision effect on abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of fat from abdominal surgical incisions made using two different methods: electrosurgery (ES) and ultrasonic Harmonic blade (HB). Ultrasonic devices offer better coagulation with less tissue damage. Results provide insight into the differences between ES and HB at a molecular level.
