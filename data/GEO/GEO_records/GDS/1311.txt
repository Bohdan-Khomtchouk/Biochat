TITLE
Age effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior

SUMMARY
Analysis of aged brain after activation of the peripheral innate immune system by intraperitoneal injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  Results provide insight into molecular events underlying severe behavioral deficits (delirium) common in older adults with systemic infections.
