TITLE
Long-term octreotide treatment of neuroendocrine tumor cell line CNDT2.5

SUMMARY
Analysis of ileum neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell line CNDT2.5 treated with octreotide for up to 16 months. Somatostain analog octreotide is used to treat NET patients. Results provided insight into molecular basis of successful octreotide therapy or the development of drug resistance in NETs.
