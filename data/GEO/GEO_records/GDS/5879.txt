TITLE
Pulmonary CDC11c+ cells from young and middle-age animals

SUMMARY
Analysis of pulmonary CDC11c+ cells from 6-8 week and 10-13 month old C57BL/6 animals. CDC11c+ cells are key modulators of the immune response in the lung. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the decline in immune function associated with aging.
