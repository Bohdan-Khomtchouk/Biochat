TITLE
Acute myeloid leukemia with CEBPA mutations [AMLSG cohort]: mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mononuclear cells from bone marrow of untreated AML patients with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha double mutation (CEBPAdm) or single mutation (CEBPAsm). Favorable outcome is observed in AML patients with CEBPAdm. Results provide insight into molecular basis of AML classification.
