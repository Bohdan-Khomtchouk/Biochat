TITLE
Notch1 signaling inhibition effect on aortic valve interstitial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of aortic valve interstitial cells treated with the Notch1 signaling inhibitor DAPT. NOTCH1 mutations are associated with aortic valve malformations and adult-onset calcification. Results provide insight into the role of Notch in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease.
