TITLE
MOZ-TIF2 fusion oncogene-associated leukemic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), with granulocyte monocyte precursor (GMP) surface phenotype, from a MOZ-TIF2 model of leukemia (L-GMPs) and their normal GMP counterparts. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution and maintenance of LSCs in leukemogenesis.
