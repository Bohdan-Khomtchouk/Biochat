TITLE
Beta-4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit deficiency effect on the brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains of beta-4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit null mutants. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the beta-4 subunit's role in the bradycardic response to vagal stimulation, nicotine-induced seizure, and anxiety.
