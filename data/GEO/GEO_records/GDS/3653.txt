TITLE
ob/ob liver response to low doses of leptin

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from ob/ob animals treated with 12.5 or 25 ng/hour of leptin. Treatment of ob/ob animals with 12.5 ng/hour of leptin lowers blood glucose and that with 25 ng/hour normalizes plasma glucose and insulin without reducing body weight.
