TITLE
Lymphotoxin-β receptor agonist antibody effect on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of MEFs treated for 24hrs with ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lymphotoxin-β receptor agonist antibody (LTβR), and LPS+ LTβR.  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying a potentially synergistic effect of LTβR signaling on LPS-TLR4 signaling.
