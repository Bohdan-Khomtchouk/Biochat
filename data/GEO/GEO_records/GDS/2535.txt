TITLE
Vanadium pentoxide effect on lung fibroblasts: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung fibroblasts for up to 24 hours following exposure to vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Exposure to V2O5 is a cause of occupational bronchitis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to airway remodeling associated with V2O5-induced bronchitis.
