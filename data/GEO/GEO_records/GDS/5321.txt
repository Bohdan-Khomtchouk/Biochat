TITLE
Normal ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells immortalized with hTERT

SUMMARY
Analysis of paired normal hTERT-immortalized ovarian (OCE) and fallopian tube (FNE) epithelial cell lines derived from two cancer-free donors. Results provide insight into gene signatures distinguishing the two cell types that could potentially identify the cell-of-origin of ovarian tumors.
