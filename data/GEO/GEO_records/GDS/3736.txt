TITLE
Reversible pressure overload of left ventricle model

SUMMARY
Analysis of left ventricle from C57BL/6  subjected to banding and debanding of the ascending aorta to mimic aortic stenosis (AS) and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR) in humans. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the early phase of AVR-induced reverse remodeling.
