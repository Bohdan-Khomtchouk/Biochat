SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebella from symptomatic, postnatal day 30 cystatin B (CSTB)-deficient mice. Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the CSTB gene. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of EPM1 pathogenesis.
