TITLE
A 3-D ex vivo model of oral wound healing: primary gingival fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of gingival fibroblasts populating sponge-type or gel-type collagen scaffolds loaded with platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Collagen scaffolds augment oral soft tissue to support wound repair. Results provide insight into molecular basis of cell population dynamics of collagen scaffolds.
