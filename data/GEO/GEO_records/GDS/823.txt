TITLE
Breast cancer cell expression profiles (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines HCC 1954 and MDA-MB-436 in reference to mammary epithelial cells. Results used to validate a method of comparing data generated from Affymetrix arrays to that from cDNA arrays. The method uses DNA sequence to match probes between platforms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL97 : [HG-U133B] Affymetrix Human Genome U133B Array
