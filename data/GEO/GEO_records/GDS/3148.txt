TITLE
Hepatocyte growth factor effect on Met receptor-knockout primary hepatocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Met-deficient hepatocytes treated with HGF for up to 24 hours. HGF/Met signaling controls invasive growth and metastasis in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Results identify a Met-dependent gene expression signature that may help elucidate the oncogenic process.
