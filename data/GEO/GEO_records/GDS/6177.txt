TITLE
Acute alcohol consumption effect on whole blood (control group): time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood from subjects administered orange juice w/o alcohol. Blood collected at time points corresponding to collection times for the alcohol group in GDS4938. These results, together with those from GDS4938, provide insight into molecular response of blood during acute ethanol exposure.
