TITLE
Smooth muscle cell cord morphogenesis (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of HITC6 vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) before and after serum withdrawal-induced formation of cords showing end-to-end and side-to-side SMC assemblies that approximate the association of SMCs in the arterial media. Results provide insight into molecular basis of SMC cord morphogenesis.
