TITLE
TGFβ1 effect on HMEC-TR mammary epithelial cell line deficient in Smad4 or TIF1γ

SUMMARY
Analysis of HMEC-TR cells silenced for TIF1γ or Smad4 and treated with TGFβ. A strong EMT increase was observed in TIF1γ-silenced cells after TGFβ1 treatment;  Smad4 inactivation completely blocked this process. Results show the relationship between TIF1γ and Smad4 in TGF-β signaling and EMT.
