TITLE
Stem cell factor SOX2-deficient stomach carcinoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastric cancer (GC) cell line AZ-521 induced to express dominant-negative SOX2 (dnSOX2), a C-terminally truncated version of SOX2, for up to 24hr. Aberrant expression of specific gastric differentiation marker SOX2 has been observed in GC. Results provide insight into role of SOX2 in GC.
