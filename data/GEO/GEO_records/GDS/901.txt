TITLE
Estrogen receptor alpha L540Q mutation effect on gene induction by estradiol: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer cell line 231/ERalpha expressing L540Q mutant estrogen receptor after 1 or 2 hour estradiol treatment. Mutant receptor is defective in binding steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) proteins. Results identify estrogen-regulated genes that require SRCs for expression.
