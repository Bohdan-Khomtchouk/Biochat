TITLE
ER-positive/HER2-negative and ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer biopsies (USO-02103 cohort)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pre-treatment biopsies from 62 HER2-normal breast cancer patients (ER-positive and ER-negative subtypes) from US Oncology clinical trial 02103. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms associated with chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer subtypes.
