TITLE
HIV envelope protein gp120 effect on activated B cells from healthy donors: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of B cells isolated from healthy donors in response to activation in the presence of HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 with high (gp120++) or low (gp120-) affinity for integrin α4β7. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which α4β7-gp120 interaction negatively affects B cells.
