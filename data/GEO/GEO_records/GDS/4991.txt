TITLE
Glyoxalase 1 overexpression effect on the brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains from C57BL/6J transgenics overexpressing glyoxalase 1 (Glo1). Glo1 is a cytosolic enzyme that catabolizes acyclic alpha-oxoaldehydes, particularly methylglyoxal. Results provide insight into the effect of Glo1 on anxiety-like behavior.
