TITLE
Comparison of Rho kinase inhibitor and atorvastatin effects on primary cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of three primary cell lines treated with Rho kinase (ROCK) 2 inhibitor SLx-2119 or with atorvastatin. Effects of ROCK inhibitors overlap to some extent with the pleiotropic (nonlipid lowering) effects of statins. Results suggest possible synergistic effects between the two classes of drugs.
