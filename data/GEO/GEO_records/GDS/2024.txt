TITLE
Lung immune response to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of SCID animals at various time points up to 12 days post infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. SCID animals have no functional B or T cells but a fully functional innate immune system. Results provide insight into the immune response to helminth infection in the lung.
