TITLE
HNF4A deficiency effect on embryonic stem cell model of hepatocyte differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of H9 (WAO9) embryonic stem (ES) cells subjected to hepatic differentiation protocol. ES-derived hepatocytes depleted of nuclear hormone receptor HNF4A also examined. Results provide insight into the role of HNF4A during the formation of hepatocytes from pluripotent stem cells.
