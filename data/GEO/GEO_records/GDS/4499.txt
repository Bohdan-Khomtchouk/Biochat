TITLE
Larval brains and imaginal discs with centrosome loss or amplification

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3rd instar larval brains and imaginal discs that lack centrosomes (DSas-4 and DSas-6) or have too many centrosomes (SakOE). Centrosome defects are common to many cancers. Results provide insight into the effects of centrosome loss or amplification on cell physiology.
