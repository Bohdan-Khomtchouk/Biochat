TITLE
Neonatal and adult pancreatic beta cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of β-cells from neonatal (postnatal day 2-3) and adult (10 wk old) Wistar rats. Neonatal β-cells are developmentally immature and, therefore, less glucose responsive. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of mature glucose responsiveness.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
