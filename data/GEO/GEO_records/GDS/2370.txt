TITLE
Staphylococcus aureus virulent clinical isolate and isogenic mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus UAMS-1 virulent clinical isolate and its isogenic agr and sarA mutants. agr and sarA genes encode global regulators important in virulence factor production and biofilm formation. Results provide insight into the differences between clinical and laboratory strains.
