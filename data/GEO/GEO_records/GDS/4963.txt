TITLE
Transcription factor FOXO1 silencing effect on Ewing Sarcoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ewing sarcoma cell line A673sh (a doxycycline-inducible, EWS-FLI1-shRNA expressing derivative of A673) transfected with pRS-sh-FOXO1 plasmid targeting FOXO1wt, in the presence or absence of Dox. Results provide insight into FOXO1's contribution to the EWS-FLI1 transcriptional signature.
