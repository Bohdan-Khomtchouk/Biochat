TITLE
TELOMERASE ACTIVATOR 1 overexpression effect on the leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves overexpressing TELOMERASE ACTIVATOR 1 (TAC1). TAC1 is a zinc finger protein that potentiates many of the responses to auxin, including the induction of telomerase. Results provide insight into the function of TAC1.
