TITLE
Steady-state culture response to transient perturbations in carbon source: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of steady state cultures growing on galactose following a pulse of 0.2 or 2 grams of glucose per liter. Gene expression examined at various time points up to 4 hours after glucose addition. Results provide insight into the dynamics of the transcriptional response to changing environments.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
