TITLE
Keratinocyte differentiation promoted by Notch1 signaling

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in keratinocytes from embryos at 15.5 days of gestation to that from 2 day newborns infected with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively activate Notch1. Results indicate that Notch1 promotes differentiation in part through caspase 3.
