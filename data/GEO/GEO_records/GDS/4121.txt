TITLE
Hepatocyte growth factor treatment of prostate cancer DU145 cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of DU145 prostate cancer cells treated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for up to 24 hrs. HGF receptor c-MET is specifically expressed in immature prostate cells. Results provide insight into the role of immature cells in prostate cancer by analysis of the HGF/c-MET pathway.
