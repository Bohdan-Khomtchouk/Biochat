TITLE
Prostate cancer cell line response to overexpression of Twist1 and Twist1 mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of Myc-Cap prostate cancer (PC) cells overexpressing Twist1 and mutants F191G, AQA, and DQD. Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a master regulator of EMT that promotes cancer metastasis. Results provide insight into molecular basis of Twist1-induced PC metastasis.
