TITLE
CXC chemokine ligand 4 effect on monocyte-derived macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood monocytes differentiated to macrophages (MP) with CXC Chemokine Ligand 4 (CXCL4) and macrophage colony-stimulation factor (M-CSF). In atherosclerotic arteries, monocytes differentiate to MPs in the presence of growth factors, such as M-CSF, and chemokines, such as CXCL4.
