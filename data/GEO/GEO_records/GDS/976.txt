TITLE
Flagellar export apparatus component FlhA inactivation effect on virulence

SUMMARY
Comparison of the V26 attenuated strain to the V1 strain with a component of the flagellar export apparatus FlhA inactivated.  FlhA inactivation decreases virulence.  Results show that the expression profile of V1 with FlhA inactivated is similar to that of V26.
