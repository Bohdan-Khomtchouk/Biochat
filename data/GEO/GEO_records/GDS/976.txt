TITLE
Flagellar export apparatus component FlhA inactivation effect on virulence

SUMMARY
Comparison of the V26 attenuated strain to the V1 strain with a component of the flagellar export apparatus FlhA inactivated.  FlhA inactivation decreases virulence.  Results show that the expression profile of V1 with FlhA inactivated is similar to that of V26.

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni
