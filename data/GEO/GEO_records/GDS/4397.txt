TITLE
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine effect on colorectal cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines treated with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). 5-aza-dC, a DNA methylation inhibitor, was used to reactivate silenced genes in the CRC cell lines. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic alterations in CRC.
