SUMMARY
Analysis of superficial (SZ) and intermediate/deep (IDZ) zones microdissected from articular cartilage and resting (RZ) zone from growth plate cartilage of proximal tibial epiphyses of 10-day old rats. Results provide insight into molecular basis of articular and growth plate cartilage divergence.
