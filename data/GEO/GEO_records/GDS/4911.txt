TITLE
Traumatic brain injury model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lateral cortices of brains from Wistar males for up to 48 hours following traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI induced by lateral moderate fluid percussion. Results provide insight into the nature of temporal events that occur at the molecular level following TBI.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
