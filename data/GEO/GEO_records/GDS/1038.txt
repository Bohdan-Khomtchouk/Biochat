TITLE
Adenylate cyclase activator forskolin effect on pheochromocytoma cell line (RAE230A)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells treated with 10 uM forskolin for 1 hour. Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase.  Effect of 1,9 dideoxy forskolin, an inactive analog of forskolin, also examined. Results identify genes whose expression responds to changes in cAMP levels.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
