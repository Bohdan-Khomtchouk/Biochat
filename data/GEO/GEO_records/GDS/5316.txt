TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast response to ectopic expression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with retroviruses encoding four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) and sampled at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of MEFs into induced pluripotent stem cells.
