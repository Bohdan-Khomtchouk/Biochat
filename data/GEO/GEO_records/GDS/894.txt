TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to exercise and circadian rhythms

SUMMARY
Analysis of effects of resistance exercise (RE) and time of day in skeletal muscle. Biopsies of male vastus lateralis muscle obtained 6 and 18 hours after acute RE, or no RE. Results suggest that RE may directly modulate circadian rhythms in skeletal muscle.
