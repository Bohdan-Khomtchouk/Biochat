TITLE
Carbon source quality effect on gene expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of MG1655 cells grown aerobically in several media each with a different carbon source.  Carbon sources used in decreasing order of quality were glucose, glycerol, succinate, L-alanine, acetate, and L-proline. Results provide insight into the response of cells to carbon source quality.
