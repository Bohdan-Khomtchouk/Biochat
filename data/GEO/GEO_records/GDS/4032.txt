TITLE
CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells from spleen of NOD model of type 1 diabetes

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted, splenic CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) and conventional CD4+CD25- T cells (Tconv) from 6 to 7-week-old, nonobese diabetic NOD mice. FoxP3+Tregs protect against autoimmune T1D. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the immune dysregulation in this T1D model.
