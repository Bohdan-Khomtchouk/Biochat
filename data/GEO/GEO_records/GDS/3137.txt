TITLE
Antifungal compound sampangine effect on Saccharomyces cerevisiea

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with the antifungal compound sampangine. Sampangine exhibits strong inhibitory activity against opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans. Using S. cerevisiae as a model, results provide insight into sampangine's mechanism of action.
