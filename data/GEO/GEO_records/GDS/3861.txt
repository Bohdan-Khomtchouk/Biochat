TITLE
Synthetic androgen R1881 effect on transcription factor SRF-deficient prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP androgen-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma cells, SRF (serum response factor)-silenced and treated with synthetic androgen R1881.  Effects of androgens on prostate cancer (PCa) cells can be mediated by SRF. Results provide insight into targets for androgen action in PCa cells.
