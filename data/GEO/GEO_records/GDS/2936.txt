TITLE
Neural retina leucine zipper deficiency effect on retinas: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas of mutants lacking the rod photoreceptor-specific neural retina leucine zipper protein (Nrl), at up to 2 months of age. In the absence of Nrl, rods are missing and cones increase in number. Results provide insight into the differences between the two photoreceptor subtypes.
