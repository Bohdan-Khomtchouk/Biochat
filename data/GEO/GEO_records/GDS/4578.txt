TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated, NFκB ζ inhibitor (IκBζ) deficient-peritoneal macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of IκBζ-deficient peritoneal macrophages (PMψ) stimulated with LPS. These PMψ exhibit impaired secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) which is critical for directing monocyte migration to inflammation sites. Results provide insight into role of IκBζ in Mψ physiology.
