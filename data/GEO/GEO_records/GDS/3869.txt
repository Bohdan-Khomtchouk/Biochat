TITLE
Indolent B-cell lymphoma and very early chronic lymphocytic leukemia: peripheral blood CD4+ Tcells

SUMMARY
Analysis of in vitro-stimulated CD4+ Tcells from patients with indolent B-cell malignancies (follicular lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Results provide insight into molecular basis of lymphoma-associated aberrant stimulation response of T helper cells.
