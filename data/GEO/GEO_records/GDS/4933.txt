TITLE
Gain-of-function model for conditional activation of IKK2/NF-κB in pancreatic beta-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of islets from 11-week-old Inhibitor of κB kinase 2/pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 transgenics. The IKK2/Pdx-1 model allows activation of proinflammatory IKK2/NF-κB signaling, specific to β-cells. Results provide insight into molecular consequences of NF-κB activation in β-cells.
