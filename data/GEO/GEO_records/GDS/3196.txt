TITLE
Non-thermal low intensity pulsed ultrasound effect on leukemia cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukemia U937 cells exposed to non-thermal low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) for 6 hours to induce apoptosis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic response to nonthermal LIPUS.
