TITLE
UV-B radiation effect on UV resistance locus 8 and transcription factor HY5 mutant leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves of UV resistance locus 8 uvr8-1 and transcription factor hy5-1 mutants following exposure to a physiological dose of UV-B. Results provide insight into the role of UVR8 and HY5 in the response to UV-B radiation and into the mechanisms of UV-B perception and signal transduction.

ORGANISM
