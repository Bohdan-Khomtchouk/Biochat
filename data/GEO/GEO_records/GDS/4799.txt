TITLE
Cigarette smoke and second-hand smoke effects on obese male hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 males exposed to mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke. Smoking and obesity are risk factors for heart disease. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac responses of smoke-exposed DIO animals.
