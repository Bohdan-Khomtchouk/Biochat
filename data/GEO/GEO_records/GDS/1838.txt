TITLE
Skeletal muscle synaptic region

SUMMARY
Analysis of synaptic regions of diaphragm muscles from 16-day-old animals. Results identify genes preferentially expressed in the synaptic region of muscles. Such genes are candidates for muscle-derived retrograde signals that regulate the differentiation of motor axon terminals.
