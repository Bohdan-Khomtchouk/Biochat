TITLE
Helicobacter pylori infection effect on a gastric epithelial progenitor cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of a gastric epithelial progenitor (mGEP) cell line infected with two Helicobacter pylori strains: chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG)-associated Kx1 and gastric cancer-associated Kx2. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the ChAG-to-cancer transition induced by H. pylori.
