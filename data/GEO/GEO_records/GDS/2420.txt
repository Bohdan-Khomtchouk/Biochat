TITLE
Myoblast differentiation and p53 family members

SUMMARY
Analysis of mock and deltaNp73alpha-expressing C2C12 myoblasts 6 and 24 hours after shifting the cells to a differentiation medium. DeltaNp73alpha, a p73alpha isoform, functions as a transdominant inhibitor of other p53 family members, interfering with multiple developmental programs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
