TITLE
Transcription factor CHOP null mutation effect on fibroblasts subjected to ER stress: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryonic fibroblasts deleted for the transcription factor CHOP.  Fibroblast treated with 2 ug/ml tunicamycin for 4 or 8 hours to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms regulating the response to ER stress.
