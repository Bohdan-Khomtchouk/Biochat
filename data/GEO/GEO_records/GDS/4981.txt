TITLE
Airway epithelial cell response to IL-13 in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured airway epithelial cells (AECs) treated with IL-13 for 21 days. IL-13 induces mucous production. Excess airway mucous secretion is a feature of chronic lung diseases. Results provide insight into the molecular processes responsible for mucous production driven by IL-13 in AECs.
