TITLE
Modeled microgravity effect on activated T lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of activated T-cells subjected to modeled microgravity. The study seeks to identify microgravity sensitive genes involved in apoptosis and the immune response. Microgravity is an environment of little net gravitational force that is experienced in spaceflight and by free-falling objects.
