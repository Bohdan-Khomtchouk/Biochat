TITLE
STN7 and STN8 protein kinase mutations effect on chloroplast gene expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of protein kinase STN7 and STN8 mutants acclimated to fluctuating light using an array of nuclear chloroplast genes. The kinases regulate the distribution of absorbed solar energy between photosystems I and II. Results provide insight into the role of each in photosynthetic acclimation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
