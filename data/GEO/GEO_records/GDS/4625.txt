TITLE
Dorsal root ganglion in three peripheral neuropathic pain models: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRGs) up to 40 days post-injury in three distinct peripheral neuropathic pain models: spared nerve injury (SNI), chronic constriction injury (CCI), and spinal nerve ligation injury (SNL). Results provide insight into putative pain modulating genes.
