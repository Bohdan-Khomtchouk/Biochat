TITLE
Protein tyrosine kinase Src R388A mutant rescue by imidazole in living cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of protein tyrosine kinase Src R388A mutant protein in living cells at 1 and 12 hours after chemical rescue with imidazole. Rapid and reversible activity stimulation is an advantage chemical rescue has over inducible transcriptional systems and temperature-sensitive mutants.
