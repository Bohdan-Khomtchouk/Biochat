TITLE
Nrf2 deficiency effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from animals lacking Nrf2, a transcription factor involved in the defense against oxidative stress. The liver is often exposed to oxidative stresses, such as those induced by viruses, toxins, and surgery. Results provide insight into the role of Nrf2 in liver regeneration.
