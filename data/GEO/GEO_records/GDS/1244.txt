SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs exposed to the toxic industrial compound carbonyl chloride (phosgene). Phosgene exposure results in pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. Lungs examined at several time points up to 72 hours after exposure. Provides insight into molecular events affected in phosgene-injured lungs.
