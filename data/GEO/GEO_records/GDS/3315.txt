TITLE
Estradiol effect on breast cancer cell line in the absence of protein synthesis

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2) and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (PS). Primary E2 targets are regulated by E2 in the absence of de novo PS. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying primary and secondary E2 target gene regulation.
