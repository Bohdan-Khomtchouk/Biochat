TITLE
Ionizing radiation effect on lymphoid tissue of ATM protein kinase deficient mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph nodes from ATM-deficient males exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). ATM regulates the cellular network induced by DNA double-strand breaks and is often mutated in lymphoid tumors. Results identify parallel induction of ATM-dependent pro- and antiapoptotic signals in response to IR.
