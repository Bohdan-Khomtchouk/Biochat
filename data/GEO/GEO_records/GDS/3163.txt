TITLE
Preovulatory ovaries: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of fish preovulatory ovaries collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. In fish, the post-vitellogenic period is critical for completion of the oogenetic process. Results provide insight into molecular events occurring during the preovulatory period.
