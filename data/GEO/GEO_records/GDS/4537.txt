TITLE
CD11c+ dendritic cell depletion effect on Herpes simplex virus-1 infection of cornea

SUMMARY
Analysis of corneas from BALB/cJ hosts injected with diphtheria toxin to deplete CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) then subjected to HSV-1 ocular infection. DCs regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Results provide insight into the role of CD11c+ DCs in corneal response to HSV-1 infection.
