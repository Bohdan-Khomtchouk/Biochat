TITLE
Transcription factor ZNF395 effect on RTS3b skin cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin cancer cell line RTS3b-TR-ZNF395 following doxycycline-induced expression of FLAG-tagged ZNF395. Transcription factor ZNF395 is overexpressed in various human cancers, often in response to hypoxia. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of ZNF395 in skin cancer cells.
