TITLE
Macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide and CstF-64 overexpression

SUMMARY
Analysis of RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 hours, or overexpressing polyadenylation factor CstF-64. LPS treatment increases CstF-64 expression. Results provide insight into post-transcriptional mechanisms affected by LPS in macrophages.
