TITLE
Transcriptional regulators Bmi-1 and Mel-18 depletion effect on medulloblastoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of DAOY medulloblastoma cells following RNAi knockdown of Bmi-1, Mel-18, or both. Bmi-1 and Mel-18 belong to the Polycomb group (PcG) of transcriptional regulators. Results provide insight into the role of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.
