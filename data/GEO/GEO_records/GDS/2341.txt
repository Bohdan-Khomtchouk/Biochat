TITLE
Type I and Type II interferons effect on lung epithelial cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung epithelial A549 cells 6 and 24 hours following treatment with type I interferon (IFN), type II IFN, or both. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the synergistic antiviral and antiproliferative effects observed when type I and type II IFNs are combined.
