TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide effect on scavenger receptor MARCO deficient-dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO)-knockout animals and cultured in media containing TLR agonist LPS. MARCO is part of the innate antimicrobial immune system. Results provide insight into the role of MARCO in activated DCs.
