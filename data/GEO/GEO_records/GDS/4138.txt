TITLE
Proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin effect on cortical neurons in vitro: time course (MG_U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured cortical neurons treated with 1uM lactacystin for up to 48 hr. Lactacystin induces neuronal apoptosis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying proteasomal inhibition-induced neuronal death.
