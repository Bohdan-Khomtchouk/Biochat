TITLE
Neural tube defect: amniotic fluid

SUMMARY
Analysis of amniotic fluid samples from pregnant women carrying fetuses with neural tube defects (NTDs) diagnosed during ultrasound examination. Results provide insight into the feasibility of using amniotic fluid samples to characterize polygenic disorders, such as NTD, at the molecular level.
