TITLE
Embryonic lung side population CD45+ and CD45- cell comparison

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of CD45+ and CD45- side population (SP) cells from embryonic 17.5-day lungs.  CD45+ and CD45- main population cells also examined.  Results provide insight into the role of CD45+ and CD45- SP cells in lung development.
