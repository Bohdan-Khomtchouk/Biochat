TITLE
Rheumatoid arthritic synovium response to tocilizumab

SUMMARY
Analysis of synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis patients before and 12 weeks after the start of tocilizumab (TCZ) therapy. Results compared to those obtained from methotrexate (MTX) therapy (GDS5069) and provide insight into the differences in the mechanisms of action between TCZ and MTX.
