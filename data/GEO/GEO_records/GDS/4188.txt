TITLE
CD3+ T cell response to stimulation with CD3/CD28 or nitric oxide

SUMMARY
Analysis of healthy T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 (a Ca2+ fluxing inducer) or NO (a key trigger of mitochondrial hyperpolarization (MHP)). Enhanced Ca2+ fluxing and MHP underlie aberrant T-cell activation in SLE. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of T cell dysfunction in lupus.
