TITLE
p38-alpha deficient keratinocyte response to ultraviolet-B in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of p38-alpha deficient keratinocytes exposed to ultraviolet-B (UVB) for 4 hours in vitro. p38-alpha is a mitogen-activated protein kinase. Inflammation underlies UVB's various detrimental effects. Results provide insight into the role of p38-alpha in UVB-induced inflammation.
