TITLE
Squamous lung cancer

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of squamous lung cancer biopsy specimens and paired normal specimens from 5 patients. Differentially expressed genes integrated with protein interaction maps. Results suggest that differentially expressed genes are highly connected through protein interactions.
