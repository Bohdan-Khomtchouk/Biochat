TITLE
Embryonic J1 stem cell differentiation in vitro (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of J1 embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies in vitro. Cells examined at various time points up to 14 days after inducing differentiation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that drive embryonic stem cell differentiation.
