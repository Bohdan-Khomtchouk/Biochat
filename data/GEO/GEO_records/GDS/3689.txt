TITLE
Diesel exhaust particle effect on healthy animals: heart left ventricle

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart left ventricle from healthy animals exposed to diesel exhaust (DE) particles. Spontaneously hypertensive animals also examined. DE is linked to cardiovascular impairment. Results suggest DE exposure produces a hypertensive-like cardiac gene expression pattern in healthy animals.
