TITLE
Cystic fibrosis patients with mild and severe lung disease: nasal respiratory epithelium (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of the nasal respiratory epithelium of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with mild or severe lung disease. CF patients have identical homozygous deltaF508 CFTR genotypes but exhibit variability in pulmonary disease severity. Results provide insight into the basis of the phenotypic difference.
