TITLE
Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: tumors and histologically normal surgical margins

SUMMARY
Analysis of oral carcinoma, histologically normal margins, and adjacent normal tissues from patients with squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the tongue (training set). Results provide insight into molecular signature in histologically normal margins that is predictive of oral carcinoma recurrence.
