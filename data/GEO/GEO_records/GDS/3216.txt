TITLE
Whole seedling roots response to salinity stress: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole roots from 5-day-old Columbia seedlings subjected to 140 mM NaCl for up to 32 hours. High salinity is an important agricultural contaminant with complex effects on root physiology. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the salt stress response in whole root.

ORGANISM
