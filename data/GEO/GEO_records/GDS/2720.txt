TITLE
Forkhead O deficiency effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of lineage-negative Sca-1+, c-Kit+ (LSK) cells lacking the Forkhead O transcription factors FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4. The LSK cell population is enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Results provide insight into the role of FoxO family members in hematopoiesis.
