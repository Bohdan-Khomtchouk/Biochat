TITLE
Nonhuman primate model of Lassa fever: liver

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of liver from macaques infected with virulent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-WE or with non-virulent LCMV-Armstrong. LCMV-WE-infected macaques develop viral hemorrhagic fever similar to human Lassa fever. Results provide insight into molecular basis of LCMV pathogenesis.
