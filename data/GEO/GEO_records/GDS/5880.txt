TITLE
Nebulin deficiency effect on the quadriceps

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps muscles from 6 week old males with a conditional knockout of nebulin in their striated muscles. Nebulin is a giant filamentous protein that is coextensive with actin filaments of the skeletal muscle sarcomere. Results provide insight into the role of nebulin in adult muscles.
