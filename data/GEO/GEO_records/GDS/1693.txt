TITLE
Transcription factor Nrl deficiency effect on photoreceptor development

SUMMARY
Analysis of photoreceptors (PRs) from wild type and Nrl deficient retinas at various developmental stages. PRs isolated based on transgene GFP expression from an Nrl promoter. Nrl ablation leads to cones at the expense of rods. Results provide insight into the regulation of PR development.
