TITLE
Follicular lymphoma and higher grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients: lymph node tumor biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph node tumor from follicular lymphoma (FL) and higher grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. Transformation of FL to a more aggressive disease is often followed by rapid progression and death. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of FL transformation.
