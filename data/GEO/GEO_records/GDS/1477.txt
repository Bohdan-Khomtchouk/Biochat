TITLE
Transcription factor FoxM1 inactivation effect on breast cancer cell

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of BT-20 breast cancer cells 48 hours after transfection with FoxM1 siRNA. Elevated expression of FoxM1 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of FoxM1 in cancer cell growth.
