Progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis

SUMMARY
Comparison of lungs from patients with nodular self-limiting pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) to those with progressive fibrotic PS. About 60-70% of patients with PS have disease that resolves spontaneously, the rest follow a chronic course. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of progressive PS.
