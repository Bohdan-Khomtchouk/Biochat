TITLE
Xenograft tumors generated from iKras p53 null pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of xenograft tumors generated from independent iKras p53L/+ PDAC cell lines. Cultured parental lines also examined. Doxycycline treatment induced expression of oncogenic KrasG12D. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying KrasG12D-mediated PDAC tumor maintenance.
