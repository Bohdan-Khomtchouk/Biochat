TITLE
Inhibition of Notch signaling in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-ALL cell lines treated with γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to block Notch signaling. Cell lines include parental cells and cells transduced with ICN (a GSI-independent form of activated Notch1) or with c-Myc (a downstream Notch1 target). Results provide insight into Notch1 role in T-ALL.
