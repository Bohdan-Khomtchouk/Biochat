TITLE
Brain trauma model: time course  (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain at various time points up to 72 hours following lateral controlled cortical impact injury. Delayed cell death following trauma results in brain damage. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying brain damage after traumatic injury.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
