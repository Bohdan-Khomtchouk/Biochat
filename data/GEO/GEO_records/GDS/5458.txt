TITLE
Onecut1 deficiency effect on embryonic E14.5 retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic retinas from onecut1 (OC1) knockouts at E14.5 and from wild type littermates. OC1 is a member of the Onecut family of transcription factors characterized by a cut domain and an atypical homeodomain. Results provide insight into the role of OC1 in the retina.
