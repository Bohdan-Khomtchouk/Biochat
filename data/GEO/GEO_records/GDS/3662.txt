TITLE
A2B adenosine receptor deficient heart response to ischemic preconditioning and subsequent reperfusion

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart of A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) deficient animals subjected to ischemic preconditioning (IP) and subsequent reperfusion. IP induces cardioprotection to prolonged ischemia. A2BAR deficient animals do not respond to IP and have increased susceptibility to acute myocardial ischemia.
