TITLE
Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria model

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutant larvae defective for uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) at 56 to 96 hours post-fertilization (hpf). UROD is the fifth enzyme in heme biosynthesis. The UROD mutant is a model for hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of HEP.
