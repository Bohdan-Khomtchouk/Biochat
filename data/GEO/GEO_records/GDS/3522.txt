TITLE
Lung response to aerosolized non-typeable Haemophilus influenza lysate: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs exposed to aerosolized non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi) lysate for 2 or 4 hours. Aerosolized NTHi treatment induces lung inflammation but protects against fatal bacterial pneumonia in animal models. Results provide insight into molecular basis of NTHi's protective effect.
