TITLE
Lupus susceptibility locus Sle1a.1 in murine model of lupus: CD4+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ T cells from B6.Sle1a.1 females. Sle1a.1 results in the production of activated and autoreactive CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are actively involved in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Sle1a.1 alters CD4+ T cell functions.
