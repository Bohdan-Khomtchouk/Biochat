TITLE
Sry-related high mobility group box 4 knockdown effect on adenoid cystic carcinoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) derived cells (ACC3) following RNAi knockdown of Sry-related high mobility group box 4 (Sox4). Sox4 is one of the most upregulated genes in ACC. Results provide insight into the role of Sox4 in the pathogenesis of ACC.
