TITLE
Cyanobacterium Synechocystis culture response to various stressors

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to various stressful growth conditions: CO2 depletion, dark, and high light. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms, including antisense (as)RNAs and non-coding (nc)RNAs, underlying cyanobacteria adaptation to various stresses.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

PLATFORM
GPL8567 : Agilent-021974 Syn_PCC6803_transcriptome
