TITLE
Claudin-1 overexpression effect on lung adenocarcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cells overexpressing Claudin-1 (CLDN1), a component of tight junction complexes. Low CLDN1 expression in lung adenocarcinomas is associated with shorter overall survival. Results provide insight into the role of CLDN1 in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma.
