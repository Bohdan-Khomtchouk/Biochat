TITLE
E-cadherin and TGFβ-receptor type II knockdown effect on esophageal organotypic cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of esophageal keratinocytes depleted for E-cadherin and TGFb receptor type II and grown on a collagen/Matrigel matrix with embedded fibroblasts. Loss of E-cadherin and TGFb receptor type II is common in esophageal cancer. Results provide insight into molecular basis of esophageal cancer.
