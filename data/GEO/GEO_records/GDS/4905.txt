TITLE
Sparsely or densely ionizing radiation effect on mammary gland: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary gland from females irradiated at 10 wks of age with varying doses of sparsely or densely ionizing radiation (IR). Mammary tissue collected up to 12 wks post-IR. Results provide insight into molecular response of mammary tissue exposed to different radiation qualities and doses.
