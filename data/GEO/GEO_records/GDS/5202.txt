TITLE
Type 1 interferon effect on primary neurons and fibroblasts from E14.5 embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary mixed cortical/hippocampal neurons and primary fibroblasts, derived from the same E14.5 embryos and treated with interferon (IFN)-β. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the IFN-stimulated response in the primary neuron cell population.
