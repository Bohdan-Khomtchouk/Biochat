TITLE
17β-estradiol effect on uterus of uterine epithelial ERα conditional knockout model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri from ovariectomized adult females with uterine epithelial cell-specific ERα deletion following treatment with 17β-estradiol for 2 or 24 hrs. Results provide insight into cell specific actions of ERα in the female reproductive tract.
