TITLE
Bone morphogenic protein effect on cultured sympathetic neurons: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of superior cervical ganglia (SCG) cultured neurons treated with bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) for 6 or 24h. Addition of BMPs triggers these neurons to extend multiple dendrites. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying initial formation of primary dendrites.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
