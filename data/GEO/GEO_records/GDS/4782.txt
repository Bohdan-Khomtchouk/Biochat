TITLE
Cardiomyocyte-specific Gata-4 or Gata-6 knockout effect on adult heart during pressure overload

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts with cardiac-specific deletion of Gata-4 or Gata-6 during pressure overload. Deletion of each gene results in reduced response to pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. Results provide insight into overlapping and unique transcriptional programs of Gata-4 and Gata-6 in the heart.
