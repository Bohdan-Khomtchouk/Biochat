TITLE
Carboplatin effect on epithelial ovarian cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of 36M2 epithelial ovarian cancer cells (EOC) treated with 100 uM carboplatin for up to 36 hours. Gene expression profile compared to those from ovarian cells of patients with unfavorable and favorable outcomes. Results provide insight into the mechanism of drug resistance in EOC.
