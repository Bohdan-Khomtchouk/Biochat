TITLE
Escherichia coli O157:H7 response  to cinnamaldehyde: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of E. coli O157:H7 exposed to cinnamaldehyde (CIN) for up to 4 hours. CIN is a natural antimicrobial effective against many foodborne pathogens including Escherichia coli O157:H7. Results provide insight into molecular processes underlying CIN-induced transient inhibition of E. coli.
