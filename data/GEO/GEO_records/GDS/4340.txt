TITLE
Non-obese diabetic (NOD) and disease-resistant NOD.NOR-Chr4 models: splenic B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of anti-IgM-F(abâ€™)2 fragment-stimulated, splenic B cells from non-obese diabetic (NOD) or NR4 (NOD background with Chromosome 4, type 1 diabetes (T1D)-resistance alleles) females. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying NOD and NR4 diabetogenic activity.
