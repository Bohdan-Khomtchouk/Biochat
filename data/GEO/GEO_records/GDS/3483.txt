TITLE
Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell response to hypoxia in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells subjected to hypoxia for up to 48 hours. Pulmonary hypoxia is a common complication of chronic lung diseases leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.
