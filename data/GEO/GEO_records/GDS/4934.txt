TITLE
Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 deficiency effect on islet β-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1)-depleted pancreatic islet β-cells, normal islet β-cells and α-cells. Expression of Pdx1 transcription factor becomes limited to β-cells over the course of pancreas development. Results provide insight into the role of Pdx1 in β-cells.
