TITLE
Forebrain neuronal subtypes

SUMMARY
Analysis of 12 distinct neuronal subpopulations from 5 regions of the adult forebrain. Results identify highly heterogeneous expression profiles that likely underlie the fundamental differences observed between neuronal classes and between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons within a given class.
