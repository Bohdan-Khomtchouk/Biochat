TITLE
Abscisic acid and gibberellin effect on calluses

SUMMARY
Analysis of calluses treated for 3 days with 50 uM of abscisic acid (ABA) or gibberellin (GA).  ABA promotes seed dormancy, while GA promotes seed germination.  Results provide insight into the crosstalk between ABA and GA regulated signaling pathways.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

PLATFORM
GPL477 : RICE oligo microarray ver1
