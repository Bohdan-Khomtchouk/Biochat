TITLE
Transcription factor gcr1 null mutant response to various carbon sources

SUMMARY
Analysis of gcr1 null mutant grown in glucose, galactose, or raffinose. Gcr1 is a transcription factor required for the normal glucose induction of G1 cyclin genes. Results provide insight into role of Gcr1 in coordinating cell cycle progression as extracellular conditions change.
