TITLE
Regulatory, pathogenic and control CD4+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of regulatory, pathogenic, and functionally neutral control T cells. Autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) play important roles in regulating immune responses and enhancing inhibition of type 1 diabetes. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms modulating Treg function.
