TITLE
Inflamed vascular epithelial cells response to apple extract enriched for procyanidins

SUMMARY
Analysis of inflamed vascular endothelial cells treated with an apple extract enriched for procyanidins of low molecular weight. Results provide insight into possible protective effects induced by the plant derived procyanidins on the endothelial cells.
