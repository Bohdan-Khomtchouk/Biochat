TITLE
Coronary artery disease response to exercise: CD133+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells of coronary artey disease (CAD) patients after 3 months of exercise. Bone marrow derived progenitor cells with endothelial differentiation potential are fewer in CAD. Results provide insight into the impact of exercise on CD133+ cells of CAD patients.
