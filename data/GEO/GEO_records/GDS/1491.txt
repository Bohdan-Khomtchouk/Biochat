TITLE
Calcineurin overexpression effect on astrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary hippocampal culture cells overexpressing an activated form of calcineurin that lacks part of its C terminus and an autoinhibitory domain. The hippocampal cultures contain neurons and astroglia. Results provide insight into the role of calcineurin in astrocyte activation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
