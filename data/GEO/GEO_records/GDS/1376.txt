TITLE
Essential thrombocythemia

SUMMARY
Analysis of platelets from patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a myeloproliferative disorder resulting in an abnormal increase in the number of blood platelets. Results indicate that distinct expression patterns of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases are associated with ET.
