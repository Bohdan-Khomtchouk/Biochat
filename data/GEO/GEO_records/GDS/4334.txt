TITLE
B7x effect on CD8 T cell-mediated diabetes model AI4αβ: pancreatic CD8 T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic AI4αβ CD8 T cells isolated from Rip-B7xAI4αβ (overexpressing B7x in the β cells) and AI4αβ (lacking B7x) mice. B7x inhibits CD8 T cell-induced diabetes. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for abrogation of diabetes by B7x overexpression in β cells.
