TITLE
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 null mutation effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver of 6 week old stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) knockout females. SCD1 is a lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monosaturated fatty acids. SCD1 null mutants have reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and are resistant to diet-induced weight gain.
