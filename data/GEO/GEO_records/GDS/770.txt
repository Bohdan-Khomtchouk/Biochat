TITLE
Long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutant expression profiling

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in long-lived daf-2 mutants for the insulin/IGF-1 receptor.  daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(m577) alleles each examined as single and as double mutations with the daf-16(df50) allele.  DAF-2 regulates DAF-16, a transcription factor.  Results provide insight into longevity.
