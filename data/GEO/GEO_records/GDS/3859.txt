TITLE
Dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon from C57BL/6J 12-14wk-olds treated with DSS for up to 6 days. DSS model emulates clinical and histopathological features of ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying development of DSS colitis.
