TITLE
Kupffer cell depletion effect on steatosis in the context of high-fat-diet-induced obesity

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from C57BL/6 males fed high fat diets (HFD) for 20 wks to induce obesity and hepatic steatosis, and injected with clodronate during the last week of HFD to deplete Kupffer cells (KCs) in liver. Results provide insight into role of KCs in regulation of hepatic triglyceride storage.
