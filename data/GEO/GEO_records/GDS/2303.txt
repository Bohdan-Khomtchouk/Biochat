TITLE
ATP binding cassette transporter A1 overexpression effect on LDL receptor-deficient livers

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of LDL receptor (LDLr) knockout (KO) mutants overexpressing ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), responsible for cellular lipid efflux. LDLr KO is a model of hypercholesterolemia. Results provide insight into the role of ABCA1 in cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis.
