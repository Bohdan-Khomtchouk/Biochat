TITLE
Multiple normal tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of 42 normal tissues. Housekeeping genes (HKG) are constitutively expressed in all tissues; tissue-enriched genes (TEG) are more highly expressed in a single tissue type than in others. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which cells maintain basic and tissue-specific functions.
