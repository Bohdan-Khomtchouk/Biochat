TITLE
Fibroblast response to cytomegalovirus infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV) AD169 strain or a derivative lacking the CMV chemokine receptor US28. Cells examined at 50, 72, and 98 hours post-infection. Results identify pathways affected by CMV and provide insight into the role of US28 in the late phase of infection.
