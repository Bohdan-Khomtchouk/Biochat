TITLE
Breast cancer cell expression profiles (HG-U95A)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines HCC 1954 and MDA-MB-436 in reference to mammary epithelial cells.  Results used to validate a method of comparing data generated from Affymetrix arrays to that from cDNA arrays.  The method uses DNA sequence to match probes between platforms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL8300 : [HG_U95Av2] Affymetrix Human Genome U95 Version 2 Array
