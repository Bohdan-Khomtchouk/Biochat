TITLE
Embryonic pituitary gland

SUMMARY
Analysis of pituitary glands from day 17 embryos and post-hatch day 3 animals using a neuroendocrine system specific cDNA microarray. Major cell types in the anterior pituitary gland have differentiated at embryonic day 17. Results used to validate the method of amplifying RNA from pituitary glands.
