TITLE
Uroplakin II promoter-SV40Tag transgenic model for invasive bladder cancer: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of urothelium from UPII-SV40Tag transgenics at 3, 6, 20, 30 weeks of age, corresponding to premalignant, carcinoma in situ, early and later stage invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC), respectively. Results provide insight into molecular basis of early TCC development.
