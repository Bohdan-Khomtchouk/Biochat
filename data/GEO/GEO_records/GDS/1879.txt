TITLE
Myotube response to PGC-1alpha induced mitochondrial biogenesis: time course (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 myoblast-derived myotubes transduced with transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha to induce mitochondrial proliferation in the muscle cells. Cells examined up to 3 days post-transduction. Results combined with other genome-scale datasets to identify mitochondrial proteins.
