TITLE
Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand effect on bone marrow-derived macrophage cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) collected from 6-8 week old C57BL/6 animals and treated with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) for up to 3 days. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying RANKL-mediated induction of osteoclastogenesis.
