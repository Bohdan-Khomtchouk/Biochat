TITLE
Skeletal myoblast cell line KM109 differentiation: time course (I)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of primary myoblast cell line KM109 obtained from muscle biopsy of a healthy individual and induced to differentiate by serum deprivation.  Cells examined at various time points up to 14 days following serum deprivation.  Results provide insight into late myogenesis.
