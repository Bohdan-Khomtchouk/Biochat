TITLE
Bacterial cell wall component MDP effect on HEK293 cells expressing Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 variant L1007fsinsC receptor: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of HEK293 cells stably-expressing wildtype NOD2 receptor or variant NOD2L1007fsinsC and treated with muramyl dipeptide (MDP). MDP-induced NOD2 activation induces inflammatory and antibacterial factors. Results provide insight into molecular basis of NOD2-mediated immune response.
