TITLE
Conjugated linoleic acid delipidative effect on obese line: time course (dye-swap)

SUMMARY
Analysis of epididymal adipose tissue from M16 polygenic obese animals fed diet containing 1% trans-10 cis-12-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Body weight was 12% lower by day 14 on CLA diet. Adipose examined at 5 and 14 days. Results provide insight to mechanisms underlying CLA delipidative effect.
