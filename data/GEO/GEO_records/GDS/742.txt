TITLE
Compensated and decompensated hypertrophies induced by monocrotaline

SUMMARY
Analysis of compensated and decompensated hypertrophies induced by monocrotaline in Wistar.   Left and right heart ventricles examined 14 days after monocrotaline injection.  Decompensated hypertrophy is a prelude to chronic heart failure.
