TITLE
Primary keratinocyte response to in vitro cytokine exposure

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured keratinocytes treated with various cytokines: interleukin-4, -13, -17A, interferon-α, -γ, or TNF. Marked proliferation of keratinocytes characterizes the chronic inflammatory skin disease psoriasis. Results provide insight into cytokine activity signatures in keratinocytes.
