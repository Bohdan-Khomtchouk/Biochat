TITLE
Mutant transcription factor ThPOK effect on memory P14 T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD8 P14 memory cells from helper-deficient (hd/hd) animals harboring a mutation in the gene encoding ThPOK. Clonal expansion is significantly reduced in CD8 T cells lacking functional ThPOK. Results provide insight into the role of ThPOK in CD8 T cell response to acute viral infection.
