TITLE
Mmi1 RNA-binding protein mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of mmi1 mutant cells. Mmi1 binds to meiosis-specific mRNAs that contain the DSR region. DSR is a cis-acting element that allows selective removal of the meiosis-specific mRNAs during vegetative growth. Results provide insight into the molecular regulation of meiosis.
