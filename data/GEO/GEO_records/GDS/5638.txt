TITLE
Epithelial stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived epithelial stem cells (hiPSC-EpSCs). The hiPSCs, which were derived from adult dermal fibroblasts, and hEpSCs directly isolated from hair follicles also examined. Results provide insight into molecular similarities between hiPSC-EpSCs and hEpSCs.
