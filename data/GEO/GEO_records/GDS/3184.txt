TITLE
Methoxyacetic acid effect on testis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of testes of males exposed to methoxyacetic acid (MAA) for up to 24 hours. MAA is an in vivo metabolite of ethylene glycol monomethoxy ether, a solvent in industrial and household applications. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the disruption of spermatogenesis by MAA.
