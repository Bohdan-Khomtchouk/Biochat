TITLE
Model for inflammatory signaling in prostate epithelium based on expression of a constitutively active version of IκB kinase 2 (IKK2ca)

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate epithelium (PE)-PTEN+/-IKK2ca/ca and PE-PTEN+/- lateral prostates. PE-PTEN+/-IKK2ca prostates exhibit loss of smooth muscle but fail to induce invasiveness. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of inflammation and tumor development in the transgenic prostates.
