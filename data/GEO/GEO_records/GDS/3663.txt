TITLE
Zinc finger transcription factor Gata4 inactivation effect on endothelial-derived cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of atrioventricular canals (AVC) from E9.5 hearts with endocardial-restricted Gata4 inactivation. The mutant endothelium failed to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in hypocellular AV cushions. Results provide insight into the role of Gata4 in endocardial cell EMT.
