TITLE
Mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone effect on primary cortical neurons: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cortical neurons treated with 10nM rotenone for 8, 15, and 24hrs. Rotenone is a classical, high affinity inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. Results provide insight into temporal molecular events underlying rotenone-mediated cortical neuronal death.
