TITLE
Prostaglandin J2 effect on neuroblastoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells at various time points up to 24 hours following treatment with prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), a neurotoxic product of inflammation. Results provide insight into mechanisms of PGJ2-induced accumulation/aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins and to neuronal cell death.
