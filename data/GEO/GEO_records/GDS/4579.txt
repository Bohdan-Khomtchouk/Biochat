TITLE
Subchronic silicosis model: whole lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung at 28 wk following subchronic silica inhalation exposure to occupationally relevant doses and particle sizes of aerosolized silica. Results provide insight into molecular events associated with chronic silicosis.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL1355 : [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
