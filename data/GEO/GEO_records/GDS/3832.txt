TITLE
Complement protein C1q effect on immature neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary cortical neurons stimulated with C1q. In vitro, C1q, in the absence of other complement proteins, improves neuronal viability, neurite outgrowth and prevents Î²-amyloid-induced neuronal death. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the neuroprotective role of C1q.
