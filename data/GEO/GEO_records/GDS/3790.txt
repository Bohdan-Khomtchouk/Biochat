TITLE
Erk5 activation effect on endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) transfected with MEK5D, a constitutively active mutant kinase, to activate Erk5.  The MEK5/Erk5 MAPK pathway is activated by laminar shear stress in ECs. Results provide insight into the role of the MEK5/Erk5 pathway in endothelial function.
