TITLE
Clock mutant cecum response to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection at different circadian times

SUMMARY
Analysis of cecum from master circadian regulator Clock mutants infected with S. Typhimurium at two circadian times (10am and 10pm). Clock mutants infected at night exhibited higher inflammation. Results provide insight into the role of the circadian clock in the host immune response to infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
