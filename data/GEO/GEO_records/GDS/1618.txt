TITLE
Lymph node and tonsil comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph node (sinuses) and tonsil (no sinuses), highly similar secondary lymphoid organs. Metastatic tumor cells are preferentially arrested in the lymph node sinuses. Results identify signature genes that are prime candidates for mediating adhesion of tumor cells to sinusoidal cells.
