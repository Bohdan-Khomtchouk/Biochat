TITLE
Diabetic pregnancy effect on embryonic heart development

SUMMARY
Analysis of pooled E13.5 or E15.5 embryonic heart tissues from diabetic dams. Congenital heart defects (CHD) are one of the most common defects in offspring of diabetic mothers. Results provide insight into molecular changes in embryonic heart contributing to CHD offspring of diabetic pregnancies.
