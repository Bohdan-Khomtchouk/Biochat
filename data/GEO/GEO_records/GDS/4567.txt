TITLE
Filarial nematode asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase effect on immature dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of iDCs stimulated with rBmAsnRS, a recombinant nematode protein. Dysregulation of DCs has been implicated in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. rBmAsnRS attenuates colonic inflammation in a murine model of IBD. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of IBD.
