TITLE
Primary mesodermal cells from various mutants perturbed for muscle development

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary mesodermal cells from mutant embryos perturbed for the development of founder cells, fusion-competent myoblasts, or both myoblast types. 12 mutant genotypes examined. Results identify candidate myoblast subpopulation-specific genes and provide insight into embryonic myogenesis.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL72 : [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
