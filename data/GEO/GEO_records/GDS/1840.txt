TITLE
Denervation effect on somatosensory cortex: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the adult somatosensory cortex at the forepaw/lower jaw border at various time points up to 28 days after partial paw denervation. The adult somatosensory cortex undergoes reorganization in response to changes in peripheral input, such as limb usage patterns or denervation.

ORGANISM
