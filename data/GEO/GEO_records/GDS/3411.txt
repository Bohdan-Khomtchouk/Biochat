SUMMARY
Analysis of livers or lungs of fetuses dosed during gestation with up to 3 mg/(kg day) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an industrial chemical that induces growth deficits and mortality in murine neonates. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PFOA-induced developmental toxicity.
