TITLE
Olfactory bulbectomy effect on olfactory eptithelium: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the olfactory epithelium at various time points up to 5 days following olfactory bulbectomy. Olfactory bulbectomy performed to force the replacement of olfactory sensory neurons. Results provide insight into the cellular events involved in olfactory neurogenesis.
