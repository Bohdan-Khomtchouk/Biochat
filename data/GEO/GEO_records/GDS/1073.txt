TITLE
Heat shock transcription factor 1 mutant response to heat stress

SUMMARY
Analysis of a heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) temperature sensitive mutant strain subjected to heat stress at 33 degrees C. HSF1 mutant contains an arginine to serine and a phenylalanine to serine substitution at residues 206 and 256 respectively. Results identify novel targets of HSF1.
