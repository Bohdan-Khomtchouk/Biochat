TITLE
RNA helicase p68/p72 knockdown effect on skeletal muscle cells (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells following shRNA knockdown of the RNA helicases p68 and p72. C2C12 myoblasts cultured in differentiation medium to induce differentiation into skeletal muscle cells. Results provide insight into the role of p68/p72 in skeletal muscle cell differentiation.
