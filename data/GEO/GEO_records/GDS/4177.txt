TITLE
Imatinib treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines: KU-812, KCL-22 and JURL-MK1

SUMMARY
Analysis of CML cell lines (KU-812, KCL-22, and JURL-MK1) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Imatinib inhibits oncogenic BCR-ABL1, a tyrosine kinase present in most CML patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying imatinib inhibition of CML.
