TITLE
Umbilical vein endothelial cell response to shear stress and intraluminal pressure

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial cells (HUVEC) isolated from umbilical veins subjected to high shear stress or high intraluminal pressure. Umbilical veins exposed to each stimuli using a vascular ex vivo perfusion system. Results suggests that response to shear stress differs from response to pressure.
