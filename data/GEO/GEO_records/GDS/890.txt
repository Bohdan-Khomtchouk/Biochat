TITLE
Schwann cell development: neural crest stem cells to mature Schwann cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of neural crest stem cells at embryonic day (E) 9.5 and developing Schwann cells (SC) at E12, E14, E16, E18, and mature SCs at birth. Cells isolated by FACS from proteolipid-GFP transgenics. Results provide insight into stem cell regulation and Schwann cell development.
