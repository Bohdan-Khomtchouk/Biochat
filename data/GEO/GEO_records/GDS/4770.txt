TITLE
Cmah knockout effect on mdx model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): cardiac muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscle from mdx males with a human-specific deletion in the Cmah (cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid hydroxylase) gene. Cmah-/-mdx mice show increased disease severity that better approximates DMD in humans. Results provide insight into the contributions of glycosylation defects to DMD.
