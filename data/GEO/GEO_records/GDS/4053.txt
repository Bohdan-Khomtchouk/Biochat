TITLE
Postmenopausal estrogen receptor α-positive breast tumor with PIK3CA mutation

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor α-positive (ERα+) breast tumors with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) mutation. PIK3CA mutations have been observed in 30% to 40% of ERα-positive breast tumors. Results provide insight into the role of PIK3CA mutations in breast tumorigenesis.
