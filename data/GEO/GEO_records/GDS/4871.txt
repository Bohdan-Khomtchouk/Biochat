TITLE
Donor lymphocyte infusion effect on bone marrow-infiltrating CD3+ T cells of patients with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia

SUMMARY
Analysis of marrow-infiltrating CD3+ T cells isolated from relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients following donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) therapy. Four patients were DLI-responsive, two were DLI-nonresponsive. Results provide mechanistic insights into DLI response in relapsed CML.
