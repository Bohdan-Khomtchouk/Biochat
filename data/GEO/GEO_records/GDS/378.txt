TITLE
Germination and gibberellin inhibitor

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of uniconazole-P, a gibberellin biosynthetic inhibitor, on wild type and pickle (pkl) germinating seeds. pkl mutants are defective in repressing embryonic differentiation characteristics. Gibberellins promote germination of seeds.
