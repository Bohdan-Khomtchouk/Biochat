TITLE
Obese liver response to a short-term low-fat hypocaloric diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from middle-aged obese women on a low-fat hypocaloric diet for 8 weeks. The diet resulted in a mean weight loss of 5% of body weight. Results provide insight into the effect of a hypocaloric diet on the liver at the molecular level.
