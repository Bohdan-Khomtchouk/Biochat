TITLE
Iron excess effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to iron excess (17 mM) for up to 6 hrs. Although an essential metal, Fe at excess levels can disturb metal homeostasis leading to oxidative stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria stress response to Fe toxicity.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
