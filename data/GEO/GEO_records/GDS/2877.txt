TITLE
Chlamydia psittaci infection and host genetic background

SUMMARY
Analysis of peritoneal lavage from inbred C57BL/6J and DBA/2J animals 3 days after intraperitoneal injection with Chlamydia psittaci. C57BL/6J are more resistant to C. psittaci infection than DBA/2J. Results provide insight into the genetic basis of this difference.

ORGANISM
