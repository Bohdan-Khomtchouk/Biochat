TITLE
Endogenous miRNA transfection effect on cultured fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of AG01522 fibroblasts transfected with the small RNA fraction from an identical culture, essentially doubling cellular miRNA content to enhance downregulation of the normally targeted transcripts. Results provide insight into the scope of miRNA regulation in a particular cellular context.
