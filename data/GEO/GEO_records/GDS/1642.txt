TITLE
Kainate-induced status epilepticus effect on immature hippocampus: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the hippocampus of immature animals up to 240 hours following kainite (KA) induced status epilepticus (SE). Unlike adults, KA-induced SE in immature animals causes neither cell death nor recurrent spontaneous seizures. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of these responses.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
