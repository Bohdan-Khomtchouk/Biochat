TITLE
Age-related hearing loss model: cochlea

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochlea from old CBA females and males with mild or severe age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). The CBA strain it loses its hearing progressively over its lifetime. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying presbycusis.
