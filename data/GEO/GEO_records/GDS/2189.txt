TITLE
BRCA1/CtIP/ZBRK1 repressor complex depletion effect on mammary epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in 3D culture following depletion of the BRCA1/CtIP/ZBRK1 repressor complex using BRCA1 or CtIP RNAi. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the accelerated mammary tumor growth correlated with impaired BRCA1 function.
