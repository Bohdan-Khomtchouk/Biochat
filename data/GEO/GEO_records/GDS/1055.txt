TITLE
Iron deficiency effect on duodenum: time course (RAE230B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of dietary iron deprivation on duodenum. Sprague Dawleys examined at various post-natal ages up to 36 weeks. Results identify iron-responsive genes, which include those involved in intestinal iron transport, during the course of post-natal development.
