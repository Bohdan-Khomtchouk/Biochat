TITLE
Particulate matter effect on dilated cardiomyopathy model: lung and heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung and heart left ventricle from CD-1 animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) exposed to ambient particulate matter (PM). Results provide insight into potential mechanistic links between PM exposure and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in people with CHF.
