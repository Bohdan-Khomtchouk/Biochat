TITLE
Hydrostatic pressure-responsive genes in optic nerve head astrocytes

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of how astrocytes in the optic nerve head (ONH) respond to changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). ONH astrocytes exposed to 60 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure for 6, 24, and 48 hours. Lends understanding to pathogenesis of glaucoma.
