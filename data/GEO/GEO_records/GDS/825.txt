TITLE
Breast cancer cell expression profiles (G4100A)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines HCC 1954 and MDA-MB-436 in reference to mammary epithelial cells.  Results used to validate a method of comparing data generated from cDNA arrays to that from Affymetrix arrays.  The method uses DNA sequence to match probes between platforms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL875 : Agilent Human 1 cDNA Microarray (G4100A) [layout A]
