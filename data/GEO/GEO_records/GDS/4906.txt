TITLE
Exercise training effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: vastus lateralis muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscle from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients before and after 8 weeks of exercise training. Skeletal muscle dysfunction and muscle wasting are hallmark systemic effects of COPD. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying COPD muscle degeneration.
