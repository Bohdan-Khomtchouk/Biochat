TITLE
Retinoblastoma ∆G/∆G mutant allele effect on quiescent embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinoblastoma (RB) ∆G/∆G mutant MEFs deprived of serum to induce quiescence. The mutant allele disrupts RB protein (pRB) interactions with the transactivation domain of E2F transcription factors. Results provide insight into pRB functions in cell cycle control independent of E2F.
