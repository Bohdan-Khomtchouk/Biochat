TITLE
Pediatric age-specific host response to septic shock: whole blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole blood from children (up to 10 years old) within 24hrs of PICU admission for septic shock. Sepsis therapies useful in adults and older children may have little effect in immunologically immature younger patients. Results provide insight into age-specific host response to sepsis.
