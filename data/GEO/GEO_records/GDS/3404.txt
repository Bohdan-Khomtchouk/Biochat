TITLE
Dicer deficiency effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells homozygous or heterozygous null for Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease required for processing microRNAs. Loss of microRNA pathway components negatively affects ES cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of microRNAs in ES cell development.
