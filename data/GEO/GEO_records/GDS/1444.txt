TITLE
Obesity and type 2 diabetes: role of adipogenic gene expression (Mu11K-A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of lean (C57BL/6J (B6), BTBR, F1 (B6xBTBR)), obese (B6-ob/ob), and obese-diabetic (F2 (B6xBTBR)-ob/ob [increasingly hyperglycemic], BTBR-ob/ob [severely diabetic]) strains. Results identify decreased adipogenic gene expression in obesity and further changes in the progression to diabetes.
