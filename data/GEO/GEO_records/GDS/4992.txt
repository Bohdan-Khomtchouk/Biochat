TITLE
Cholestatic intestinal injury model: jejunum

SUMMARY
Analysis of jejunum from AJ and C57BL6J males with common bile duct ligation (CBDL). The two strains demonstrate different rates of cholestasis-related bacterial translocation and mortality. Results provide insight into molecular pathways underlying intestinal injury following cholestasis.
