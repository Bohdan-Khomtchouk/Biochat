TITLE
GB virus C effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver biopsies from HCV/HIV co-infected patients who are positive for GB virus C (GBV-C) infection. GBV-C infection reduces HCV-related liver disease in HCV/HIV co-infection. Results provide insight into underlying molecular mechanisms that may be involved in the reduced liver disease.
