TITLE
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: fibroblast  (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of three fibroblast cell lines derived from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) patients. Identified changes in gene expression may provide clues to potential risk factors or factors influencing disease progression.
