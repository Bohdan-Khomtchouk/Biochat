TITLE
Chronic myelogenous leukemia CD34+CD38- cells response to histone deacetylase inhibitor analog and imatinib mesylate

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) CD34+CD38- cells cultured with histone deacetylase inhibitor analog LBH589 (LBH) and/or BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying treatment of CML with LBH and IM.
