TITLE
Metastatic prostate cancer (HG-U95C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of metastatic prostate tumors and primary prostate tumors.  Normal tissue adjacent to the tumor and normal donor tissue also examined. Metastasis reflects the most adverse clinical outcome. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic process.
