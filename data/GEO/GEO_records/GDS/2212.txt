TITLE
Flagellin effect on toll-like receptor 5 deficient intestinal lamina propria cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD11c positive intestinal lamina propria cells (LPC) from toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) null animals stimulated with flagellin. TLR5 mediates the immune response to flagellin. Results provide insight into the role of CD11c positive LPCs in the innate immune response mediated by TLR5.
