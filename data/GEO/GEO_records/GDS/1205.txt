TITLE
Ssl1 mutant for a subunit of TFIIH response to methyl methanesulfonate

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ssl1 mutant for a subunit of TFIIH treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Ssl1 mutant contains C406A substitution and is sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as MMS. Results provide insight into the relationship between transcription and DNA repair.
