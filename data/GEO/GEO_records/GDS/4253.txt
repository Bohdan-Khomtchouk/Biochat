TITLE
Lung epithelial cells response to lipopolysaccharide exposure

SUMMARY
Analysis of laser-microdissected airway epithelial cells from snap-frozen lung 0 and 2 days after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Inhalation of LPS can lead to chronic lung diseases like cystic fibrosis and asthma. Results provide insight into inflammatory mediators modulated by LPS exposure.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
