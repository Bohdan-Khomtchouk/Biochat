TITLE
Lung epithelial cells response to lipopolysaccharide exposure

SUMMARY
Analysis of laser-microdissected airway epithelial cells from snap-frozen lung 0 and 2 days after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. Inhalation of LPS can lead to chronic lung diseases like cystic fibrosis and asthma. Results provide insight into inflammatory mediators modulated by LPS exposure.
