TITLE
Interleukin-20 subfamily cytokines effect on epidermal keratinocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured epidermal keratinocytes treated with various cytokines of the interleukin-20 (IL-20) subfamily. IL-20 cytokines are up-regulated in psoriatic skin. Results provide insight into the role of IL-20 cytokines in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
