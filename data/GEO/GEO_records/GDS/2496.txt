TITLE
Lung response to carcinogens that test positive in two-year rodent bioassays

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of B6C3F1 females 13 weeks following treatment with chemicals that test positive in two-year rodent cancer bioassays. Results provide insight into the feasibility of using expression signatures, as alternatives to standard two-year bioassays, to identify chemical carcinogens.
