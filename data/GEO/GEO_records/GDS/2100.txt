TITLE
Intestinal lymphoid tissues infected with Yersinia enterocolitica: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Peyer's patches (PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) infected with enteric pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. PP and MLN removed from animals at various time points up to 7 days post oral infection. Results provide insight into the host response to pathogens within the PPs and MLNs.
