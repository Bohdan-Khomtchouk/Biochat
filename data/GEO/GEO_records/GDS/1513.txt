TITLE
Neonatal brains from X-monosomic females

SUMMARY
Analysis of neonatal brains of X-monosomic females that inherited either a maternal or a paternal X chromosome. X-monosomy is the basis of Turner's syndrome (TS). Expressivity of TS phenotypes depends partly on the parental origin of the single X. This expressivity may be due to imprinted X genes.
