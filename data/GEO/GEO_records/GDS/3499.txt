TITLE
TREM-1 activation effect on monocytes in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured monocytes following TREM-1 activation by treatment with an antibody against TREM-1. TREM-1 is an immunoreceptor expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Results provide insight into the cellular consequences of TREM-1 activation.
