TITLE
Budding yeast response to heme deficiency

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant cells lacking aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase. ALA synthase catalyzes the first step of heme biosynthesis. Heme uptake is induced by heme starvation in S. cerevisiae. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating heme uptake.

ORGANISM
