TITLE
Targretin, 9-cis retinoic acid, and 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide effect on various organs

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal livers, lungs, and mammary glands from Sprague Dawleys treated with targretin (TGR), 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA), or 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4HPR).  Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the varying chemopreventive anti-cancer effects of these agents.
