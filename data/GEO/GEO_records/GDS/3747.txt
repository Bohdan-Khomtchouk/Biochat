TITLE
Transcription factor ETS-4 deletion effect on larvae

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage L4 larvae with two distinct deletion alleles of ets-4: ets-4(ok165) and ets-4(uz1). Adults with ets-4 mutations have a significant extension of mean life span. Results provide insight into the transcriptional control of aging effectors by the ETS-4 transcription factor.
