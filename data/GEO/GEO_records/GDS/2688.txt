TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to chronic corticosteroid exposure: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles of adrenalectomized animals given methylprednisolone (MPL) at a constant rate of infusion for up to 7 days. Results compared to a time series experiment using a single dose of MPL. Results provide insight into the identity of genes regulated by MPL in both regimens.

ORGANISM
