TITLE
H6 family homoebox 1 deficiency effect on the retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas of C57BL/6J animals deficient for H6 family homeobox 1 (HMX1). Loss of Hmx1 function in humans results in an oculoauricular defect leading to eye and auricular developmental abnormalities as well as early retinal degeneration. Results provide insight into role of Hmx1 in retina.
