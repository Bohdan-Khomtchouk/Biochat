TITLE
Trim24 deficient hepatocellular carcinoma tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors from animals lacking Trim24 (Tif1alpha). Trim24 is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor transcriptional co-regulator. Animals lacking Trim24 develop HCC. Results provide insight into the potential role of Trim24 as a liver-specific tumor suppressor.
