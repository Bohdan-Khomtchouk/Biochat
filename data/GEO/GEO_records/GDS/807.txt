TITLE
Estrogen positive breast cancer recurrence during tamoxifen therapy: microdissected tumor

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of microdissected estrogen positive primary breast cancer tumors from 60 patients.  Patients later treated with tamoxifen for 5 years, and tumors grouped according to whether cancer recurred.  Results identify markers of disease-free survival that include HOXB13 and IL17BR.
