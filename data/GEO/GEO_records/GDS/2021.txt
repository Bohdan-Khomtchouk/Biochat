TITLE
Coronary smooth muscle cell response to beta-1 receptor blockers metoprolol and nebivolol

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of coronary smooth muscle cells treated with metoprolol or nebivolol. Metoprolol and nebivolol are beta 1-receptor blockers. In a study of 155 patients with hypertension, adverse effects of metoprolol were higher than nebivolol (Uhlir et al. 1991).
