TITLE
Mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu model

SUMMARY
Analysis of cancer progression by profiling of preneoplastic mammary glands and tumors of MMTV-neu animals. Activated neu allele placed under the control of mammary tumor virus promoter to enable mammary specific expression. Results provide insight into the early events of Neu induced tumorigenesis.
