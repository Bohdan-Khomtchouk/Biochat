TITLE
Atorvastatin treatment of familial combined hyperlipidemia: peripheral blood monocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes from male, familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) patients following 4 wks of treatment with atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that slows the production of cholesterol. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of FCH.
