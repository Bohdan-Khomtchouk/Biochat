TITLE
Hoxa11/Hoxd11 null mutation effect on embryonic kidney development (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys from Hoxa11/Hoxd11 double null mutants at various embryonic ages up to E16.5. Hox11 genes play critical roles in kidney development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of Hox11 function in kidney development.
