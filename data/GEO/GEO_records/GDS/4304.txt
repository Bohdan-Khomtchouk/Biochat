TITLE
ATP effect on acute myeloid leukemia lymphoblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphoblasts from 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients cultured for 24hrs with ATP. Extracellular nucleotide ATP inhibits proliferation and accumulation of AML cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory activity of ATP on leukemic cells.
