TITLE
MicroRNA miR-122 antisense inhibition effect on livers

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from C57BL/6 adult males treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting liver-specific microRNA (miRNA) miR-122. miR-122 is expressed at high levels in the adult liver, making up 70% of all miRNA. Results provide insight into the role of miR-122 in the adult liver.
