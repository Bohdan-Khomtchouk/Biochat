TITLE
Phenobarbital effect on nuclear receptor DHR96 null mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of DHR96 null mutant exposed to phenobarbital, a xenobiotic compound. DHR96 is an ortholog of the xenobiotic nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor. Results provide insight into the role of DHR96 in mediating xenobiotic responses.
