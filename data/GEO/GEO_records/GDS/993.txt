TITLE
Naive CD8+ T cells proliferative response to lymphopenia: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of OT-I CD8+ T cells from lymphopenic C57BL/6s. OT-I CD8+ T cells transferred into C57BL/6s, irradiated to induce lymphopenia.  OT-I CD8+ T cells examined at various time points up to 115 days after transfer. Results provide insight into mechanisms regulating homeostatic proliferation.
