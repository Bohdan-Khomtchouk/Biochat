TITLE
Growth hormone effect on bone: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of femurs and tibias of growth hormone (GH) deficient animals at 6 and 24 hours following treatment with 4 mg/kg body weight GH. Results provide insight into the insulin-like growth factor-I dependent and independent pathways that mediate the action of GH in bone.
