TITLE
Ozone effect on Toll-like receptor 4-deficient C3H/HeJ lung: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4)-deficient, C3H/HeJ males exposed to 0.3 ppm ozone (O3) for up to 48hr. Tlr4 is involved in O3-induced pulmonary hyperpermeability and inflammation. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Tlr4 modulation of O3-induced pulmonary responses.
