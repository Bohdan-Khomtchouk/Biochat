TITLE
Mutant-p53 and Pin1 depleted MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 depleted of prolyl isomerase Pin1 or mutant-p53. Pin1 overexpression and p53 mutation associate with poor outcome in breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of a Pin1/mutant p53 axis in the acquisition of aggressive features by tumor cells.
