TITLE
Aging brain: frontal cortex expression profiles at various ages

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles obtained from the postmortem frontal cortex of 18 normal males and 12 normal females at 26 to 106 years of age.  Results provide insight into molecular events underlying the onset of brain aging.
