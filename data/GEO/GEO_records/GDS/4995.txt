TITLE
Scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease patients: pulmonary fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung fibroblasts isolated from biopsies, taken at the time of diagnosis, from patients with well-defined pulmonary fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the fibrotic fibroblast phenotype in SSc-ILD.
