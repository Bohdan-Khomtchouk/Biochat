TITLE
Monocyte-derived dendritic cell response to VAF347

SUMMARY
Analysis of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells following activation with anti-CD40 antibodies for 8 hours in the presence of VAF347. VAF347 is a low molecular weight compound that inhibits allergic lung inflammation in vivo. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of VAF347.
