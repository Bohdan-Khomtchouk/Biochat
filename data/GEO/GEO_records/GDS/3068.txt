TITLE
Primary hepatocytes and HepG2 liver cells response to various fluoroquinolones

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary hepatocytes (PHs) and HepG2 liver cells treated with various fluoroquinolones. PHs are used in drug metabolism research, and HepG2 cells are surrogates for PHs. Results provide insight into the differences in the response of PHs and HepG2 cells to xenobiotics.
