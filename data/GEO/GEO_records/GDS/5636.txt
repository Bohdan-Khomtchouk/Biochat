TITLE
Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Bhlhe40-deficient differentiated T helper cell subsets in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of naive CD4+ T cells purified from the spleen of bHLH transcription factor Bhlhe40 knockouts, cultured in TH1, TH2 or TH17 conditions for 4 days, and stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 hrs. Results provide insight into the role of Bhlhe40 in the polarized TH cell lineages.
