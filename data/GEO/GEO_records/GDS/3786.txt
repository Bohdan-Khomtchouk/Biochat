TITLE
Snord116del mutant hypothalamus response to neonatal starvation

SUMMARY
Analysis of P5 and P13 hypothalami from Snord116del animals, a model for Prader-Willi syndrome, a disease that involves infantile feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. P5 neonates subjected to 6h starvation. Results provide insight into the role of Snord116 in feeding regulation in neonates.
