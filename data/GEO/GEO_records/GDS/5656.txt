TITLE
Forkhead box O 1,3,4 muscle-specific knockout effect on fasted gastrocnemius muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastrocnemius muscle from starved males with muscle-specific deletion of Forkhead Box O transcription factors 1, 3 and 4 (FoxO1,3,4-/-). Results provide insight into the collective roles of FoxOs during muscle atrophy.
