TITLE
Hypertension-related calcium-regulated gene overexpression effect on kidney cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 kidney cells overexpressing the hypertension-related calcium-regulated gene (HCaRG). HCaRG is involved in the control of renal cell proliferation and differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of HCaRG in kidney repair after injury.
