TITLE
Hyperhomocysteinemia model: heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of animals given drinking water containing 10 g/L of L-methionine to induce chronic hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). HHcy is characterized by an elevation in plasma homocysteine, and is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Results provide insight into the impact of HHcy on the heart.
