TITLE
First, second and third trimester pregnancy: maternal cell-free plasma

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell-free plasma from pregnant women during the first, second, third trimesters and immediately post-partum. Results provide insight into a noninvasive means to monitor the expression status of many tissues and measure temporal expression of genes longitudinally during development.
