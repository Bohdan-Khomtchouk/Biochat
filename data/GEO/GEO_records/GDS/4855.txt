TITLE
Pandemic and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus infections of bronchial epithelial cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of well-differentiated primary lung bronchial epithelial cells 36 hs after infection with various H1N1 influenza isolates: seasonal H1N1 BN/59, pandemic H1N1 KY/136 and KY/180. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of host responses to different H1N1 Influenza isolates.
