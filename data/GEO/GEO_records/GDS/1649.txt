TITLE
Urethane-induced lung tumor model of pulmonary adenocarcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung tumors that develop following treatment with urethane. Urethane-induced lung tumors exhibit similar histological appearance and molecular changes to human pulmonary adenocarcinoma (AC). Results compared with those from human AC (GDS1650).
