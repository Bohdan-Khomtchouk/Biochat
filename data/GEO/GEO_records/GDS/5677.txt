TITLE
Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 effect on hepatoblasts grown on uncoated plates

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutant IDH1 (R132C)-expressing hepatoblasts that were grown on uncoated plates to induce hepatocyte differentiation. IDH genes are frequently mutated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). Results provide insight into the role of IDH1 in hepatocyte differentiation.
