TITLE
CD4/CD8 double positive thymocyte response to glucocorticoid

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) thymocytes treated with the glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone for 3 hours. GC treatment induces the apoptosis of CD4/CD8 DP thymocytes. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this apoptotic effect.
