TITLE
Drosophila development: parental species and interspecific hybrids

SUMMARY
Analysis of males of 3 species (melanogaster, sechellia, simulans) and D. sechellia x D. simulans F1 hybrids during 4 developmental stages. Results within and between pure species and hybrids provide insight into both the evolution of gene regulation in the context of development and speciation.
