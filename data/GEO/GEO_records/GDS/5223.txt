TITLE
Nuclear hormone receptor NR4A1 deficiency effect on FHH model of hypertension-associated renal disease: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney from 8-24 week-old, Nr4a1-deficient (Nr4a1−/−) animals developed on the genetic background of the Fawn-Hooded Hypertensive (FHH) rat. The FHH model is susceptible to kidney injury. Results provide insight into the role of Nr4a1 in the pathogenesis of kidney disease.
