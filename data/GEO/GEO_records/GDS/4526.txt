TITLE
Wfs1 deficiency model of Wolfram syndrome: hypothalamus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypothalami from Wfs1-knockout, 129SV animals. Wfs1 deletion models Wolfram syndrome (WS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple endocrine failure. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying WS.
