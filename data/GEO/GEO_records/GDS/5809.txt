TITLE
Anti-leukemia drug etoposide effect on ecotropic viral integration site 1-overexpressing myeloid cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of myeloid cell line U937 overexpressing ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) and cultured in the presence of antileukemic drug etoposide. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms through which EVI1 confers resistance to drugs used in myeloid leukemia therapy.
