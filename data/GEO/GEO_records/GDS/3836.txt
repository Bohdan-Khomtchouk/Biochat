TITLE
Multistep pancreatic carcinogenesis: epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial neoplastic cells at 3 stages of tumor development and normal cells from the main pancreatic duct.  Anti-tumor immunity changes over the course of tumor progression. Results provide insight into how and when effective immune surveillance is overcome during cancer progression.
