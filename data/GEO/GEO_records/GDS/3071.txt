TITLE
Keloid fibroblast response to hydrocortisone in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of keloid fibroblasts (FBs) treated with 1.5uM hydrocortisone (HC). Keloids are benign dermal tumors that form during protracted wound healing. HC at 1.5uM inhibits collagen and elastin synthesis in normal scar FBs but not in keloid FBs. Results provide insight into keloid pathogenesis.
