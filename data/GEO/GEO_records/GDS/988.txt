TITLE
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus LANA overexpression in B lymphoid cells: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of B lymphoid cell lines overexpressing the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. B cells made to express LANA from a tetracycline inducible promoter.  Expression examined at various time points up to 48 hours after induction.
