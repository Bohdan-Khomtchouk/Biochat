TITLE
Multiple myeloma bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) from untreated multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In MM, BM-MSCs support myeloma cell growth. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying constitutive abnormalities in MM BM-MSCs relative to healthy donorsâ€™ BM-MSCs.
