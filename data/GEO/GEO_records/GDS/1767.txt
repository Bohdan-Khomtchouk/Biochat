TITLE
Zucker diabetic fatty model of type 2 diabetes: various insulin-sensitive tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues of Zucker diabetic fatty animals at pre-diabetic and diabetic stages. ZDF animals have a mutated leptin receptor. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL1002 : Rat 5K cDNA microarray
