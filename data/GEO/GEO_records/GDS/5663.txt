TITLE
Pulmonary dendritic cell subsets

SUMMARY
Analysis of four dendritic cell (DC) subsets purified from the lungs of C57BL/6 males following inhalation of LPS/OVA. The four subsets represent conventional DCs (cDCs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Results provide insight into molecular profiles that would discriminate between cDCs and moDCs.
