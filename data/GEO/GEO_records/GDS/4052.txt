TITLE
Estradiol effect on ERK1/ERK2-deficient MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells depleted of ERK1 or ERK2 and treated with estradiol for up to 24hrs. ERK1 and ERK2 are downstream effectors in the MAP kinase pathway; estrogen receptor α (ERα) and MAPKs play key roles in hormone-dependent cancers. Results provide insight into ERα and MAPK interactions.
