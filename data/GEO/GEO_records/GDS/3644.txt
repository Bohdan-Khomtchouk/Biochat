TITLE
Cerebral palsy: wrist muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of wrist muscle extensors and flexors of cerebral palsy (CP) patients. CP is an upper motor neuron disease that results in a progressive movement disorder. Muscles of CP patients often become spastic. Results provide insight into the molecular alterations in spastic muscles of CP patients.
