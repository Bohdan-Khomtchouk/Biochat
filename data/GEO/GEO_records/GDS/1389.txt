TITLE
1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 suppressive effect on IFN-gamma activated macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild type and vitamin D receptor (Vdr) knockout primary bone marrow-derived macrophages following treatment with IFN-gamma and/or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3). Results indicate that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 suppresses effector functions of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages.
