TITLE
Maternal western-style high fat diet effect on liver of two-week-old offspring

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from PD14 offspring of C57BL/6 dams fed a Western-style high fat/high cholesterol diet (WSD). Maternal diet is associated with the development of metabolism-related diseases in offspring. Results provide insight into molecular impact of maternal WSD on male and female offspring.
