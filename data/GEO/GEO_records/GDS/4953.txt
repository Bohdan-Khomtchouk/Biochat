TITLE
Cobalt effect on liver cell line H4IIEC3: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of H4IIEC3 liver cells exposed to 29 or 62 uM cobalt chloride. Cobalt (Co) is a heavy metal found naturally in low concentrations and used in military and industrial applications. Co exposure can result in adverse health effects. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of Co toxicity.
