TITLE
White adipose tissue remodeling: response to β3-adrenergic receptor activation

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of epididymal white adipose tissue of 3-4 month old males treated with β3-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3) agonist CL-316,243 for 0 to 6 days. Adrb3 agonists exert anti-diabetes and anti-obesity properties.
