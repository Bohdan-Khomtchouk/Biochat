TITLE
Brain, heart, and lung expression profiles of individuals from different natural populations

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains, hearts, and lungs of 9 individuals, 3 each collected from Maine, New Jersey, and Georgia. 192 metabolic genes examined. Results provide insight into the variation in tissue-specific gene expression among outbred individuals and among different natural populations of a species.
