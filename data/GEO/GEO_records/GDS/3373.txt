TITLE
Iron enriched and deficient diets effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 animals fed an iron enriched or deficient diet. Iron induces the production of hepcidin, a hepatic peptide hormone that regulates systemic iron homeostasis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating hepcidin expression.
