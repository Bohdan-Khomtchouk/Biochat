TITLE
Wing disc response to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signaling perturbations

SUMMARY
Analysis of third instar wing disc from EGFR dominant negative (71B-Gal4; UAS EgfrDN) and EGFR activated (71B-GAL4; UAS EgfrACT) larvae. Aberrant signaling of highly conserved EGFR pathway is implicated in a number of diseases. Results provide insight into the identity of new EGFR-responsive genes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
