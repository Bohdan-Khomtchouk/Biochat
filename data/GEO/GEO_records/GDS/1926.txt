TITLE
Leukotriene D4 and thrombin effect on endothelial cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and/or thrombin. LTD4 activates the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor cysLT2-R. Thrombin activates the protease-activated receptor PAR-1. cysLT2-R and PAR-1 may cooperate to augment vascular injury.
