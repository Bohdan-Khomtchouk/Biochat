TITLE
Effect of mitochondrial and oxidative stress on neuroendocrine CRI-G1 cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of insulinoma cell line CRI-G1-RR and subclonal line CRI-G1-RS. CRI-G1-RS is more susceptible to cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins such as rotenone and more vulnerable to direct oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for this vulnerability.
