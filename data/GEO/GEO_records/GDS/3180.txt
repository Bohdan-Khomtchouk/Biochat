TITLE
Estrogen effect on myometrium of ovariectomized females: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of myometria of ovariectomized animals following treatment with estradiol for 6 or 24 hours. Estrogen reduces the increased uterine sympathetic nerve density induced by ovariectomy. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen-modulated sympathetic innervation.
