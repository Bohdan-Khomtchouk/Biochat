TITLE
Erythroid differentiation: G1E model

SUMMARY
Analysis of erythroid differentiation using G1E ER4 clone cells. Estradiol addition induces Gata-1 triggering synchronous differentiation. 30 hour time course corresponds to late burst-forming unit-erythroid stage through orthochromatic erythroblast stage.
