TITLE
Staphylococcus aureus response to oxidative stress: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Staphylococcus aureus cells exposed for 10 or 20 minutes to hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress. Macrophages and other lymphocytes use reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 to destroy the bacteria. Results provide insight into mechanisms involved in S. aureus-host interactions.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus
