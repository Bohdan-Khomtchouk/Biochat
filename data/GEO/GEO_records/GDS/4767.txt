TITLE
Pancreatic cancer model: saliva supernatant

SUMMARY
Analysis of saliva from the Panc02/C57BL/6 orthotopic, syngeneic mouse pancreatic cancer model. The model was generated by implanting pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02 into the pancreas of syngeneic host C57BL/6. Results provide insight into salivary biomarkers for detection of pancreatic cancer.
