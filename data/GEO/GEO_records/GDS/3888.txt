TITLE
Non-symbiotic hemoglobin AtHb1 overexpression effect on seeds under moderate hypoxia

SUMMARY
Analysis of siliques from transgenic plants overexpressing AtHb1 and exposed to control (normoxic) and moderate hypoxic conditions. AtHb1 overexpression mediates a pre-adaptation to hypoxic stress. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AtHb1 function.
