TITLE
U2OS osteosarcoma cell line response to strigolactone analogs ST362 and MEB55: 6 hours

SUMMARY
Analysis of U2OS cells treated with strigolactone (SL) analog ST362 or MEB55 for 6hr. SL is a plant hormone. SL analogs potently inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenic effects of SL analogs towards cancer cells.
