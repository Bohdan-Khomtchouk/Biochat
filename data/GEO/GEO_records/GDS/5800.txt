TITLE
Interstitial fluid flow effect on noninvasive and invasive ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-invasive NeuN cells and invasive NeuT cells (i.e., MCF10A cells overexpressing wild-type ERBB2 or a constitutively active mutant of ERBB2, respectively) treated with IFF. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways activated by IFF in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells.
