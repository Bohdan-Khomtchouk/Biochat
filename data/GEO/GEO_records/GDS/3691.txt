TITLE
Sustained olive oil consumption effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from healthy males after 3 weeks of virgin olive oil (VOO) consumption at doses common in the Mediterranean diet.  The Mediterranean diet protects against cardiovascular diseases. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial action of VOO.
