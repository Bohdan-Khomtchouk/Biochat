TITLE
Retinoschisis model

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas from postnatal day 7 mutants lacking retinoschisin (RS1h), an animal model for retinoschisis (RS). RS is a recessive retinal dystrophy accompanied by macular disease often resulting in early-onset vision loss. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of RS.
