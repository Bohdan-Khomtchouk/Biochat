TITLE
Homeobox transcription factor Dlx5 overexpression effect on otic vesicle derived-cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of otic vesicle derived 2B1 cells overexpressing Dlx5. Dlx5 is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a key role in the development of many organ systems. Results provide insight into the role of Dlx5 in the regulation of early inner ear development.
