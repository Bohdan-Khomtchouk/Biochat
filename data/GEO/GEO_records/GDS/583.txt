TITLE
Aging time course, normal adult

SUMMARY
Examination of normal adult aging using synchronized populations at 0 - 144 hours. Employed CF512 fer-15(b26) II; fem-1 (hc17) IV mutant strain, which has defective spermatids thus eliminating contributions from embryonic transcripts.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

PLATFORM
GPL576 : UCSF elegans2b 20K array
