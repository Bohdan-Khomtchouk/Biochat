TITLE
Mechanical stimulation effect on fibroblasts from various fetal tissues (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of fetal fibroblasts from tendon, skin, and cornea following mechanical stimulation by fluid flow. Fibroblasts isolated from embryos at 19 days post conception. Results provide insight into differences among fibroblasts from different tissues and response to linear shear stress.
