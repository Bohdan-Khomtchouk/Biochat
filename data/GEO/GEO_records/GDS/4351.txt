TITLE
Inbred lines with different prion disease incubation times: whole brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain from uninfected inbred lines with previously characterized, different prion incubation times. Prion diseases exhibit a long, clinically-silent incubation period, determined in part by genetic background. Results provide insight into molecular basis of different incubation times.
