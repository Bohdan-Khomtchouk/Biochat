TITLE
Interleukin-33 effect on dual-specificity phosphatase 5-deficient bone marrow derived eosinophils

SUMMARY
Analysis of BM-derived eosinophils isolated from dual-specificity phosphatase 5-deficient mice and stimulated with IL-33. DUSP5 is a growth factor‐inducible phosphatase preferentially expressed in immune cells. Results provide insight into the role of DUSP5 in IL-33 signaling in eosinophils.
