TITLE
Asparaginyl Hydroxylase Factor inhibiting HIF-1Î± (FIH) deficiency effect on immortalized embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of FIH-null large T antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grown under normoxic conditions. von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL)-null and VHL/FIH-null mutants were also examined. Results provide insight into the role of FIH as an essential regulator of metabolism.
