TITLE
Endothelial progenitor cells from cord blood and adult peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of outgrown endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) isolated from 2 different sources: cord blood or adult peripheral blood. EPC from these different anatomic locations possess unique biological properties. Results provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of these properties.
