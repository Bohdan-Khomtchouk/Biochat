TITLE
Ionizing radiation effect on monocytic leukemia cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of leukemia THP-1 moncytes exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). IR exposure is associated with thrombotic vascular occlusion. Thrombosis in cancer is associated with poor prognosis. Results provide insight into the effect of IR on the expression of tissue factor, an activator of coagulation.
