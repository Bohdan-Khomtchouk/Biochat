TITLE
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment effect on serous ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines HEY, OVCAR5 and UCI-101 treated 24h with NSAIDs diclofenac or indomethacin (300mM). NSAID drugs associated with a reduced risk of various cancers. Results provide insight into molecular pathways mediating effects of NSAID treatment in ovarian cancer.
