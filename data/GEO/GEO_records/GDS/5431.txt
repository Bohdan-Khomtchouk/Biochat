TITLE
Rho kinase inhibition effect on epidermal keratinocyte in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary epidermal keratinocytes treated with the Rho kinase inihibitor Y-27632. The lifespan of keratinocytes is extended indefinitely by culture in the presence of Y-27632. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this lifespan extension.
