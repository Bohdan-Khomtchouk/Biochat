TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 deficiency effect on dexamethasone-treated osteosarcoma cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of U2OS-GR osteosarcoma cells (which stably express glucocorticoid receptor α) depleted for hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5) then treated with the GR ligand dexamethasone for up to 24hrs. Results provide insight into the role of LIM domain coregulator Hic-5 in GR signaling.
