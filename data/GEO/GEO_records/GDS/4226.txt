TITLE
Programmed Death-1-expressing CD8 T cells in healthy adult peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of PD-1hi, PD-1lo, and naive CD8+CD3+ T cells FACS-sorted from peripheral blood of healthy adults. PD-1, a member of the CD28 family of immune modulators, is highly expressed on chronic virus-specific CD8 T cells. Results provide insight into PD-1-expressing CD8 T cells in healthy adults.
