TITLE
Pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy effect on ventricular myocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventricular myocytes cultured 48 hours in 1 uM of pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy (PAMH) or 20 uM phenylephrine (PE). PAMH activates a modulator of calcineurin, and is as effective as phenylephrine in promoting hypertrophy. PAMH and PE treated cells exhibit similar expression.

ORGANISM
