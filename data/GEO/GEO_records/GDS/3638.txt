TITLE
Actein effect on breast cancer cell line: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDB-MB-453 breast cancer cells treated with 20 or 40 ug/ml actein for 6 or 24 hours. Actein is a triterpene glycoside from the herb black cohosh and inhibits the growth of cancer cells in vitro. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this inhibitory effect.
