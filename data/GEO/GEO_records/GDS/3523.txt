TITLE
Non-migratory villous cytotrophoblasts and invasive extra-villous trophoblasts

SUMMARY
Comparison of non-migratory villous cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and invasive extra-villous trophoblasts.  Invasion of CTBs into uterine tissues is essential for placental development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating trophoblast invasion.
