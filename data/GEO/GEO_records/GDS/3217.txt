TITLE
Estradiol effect on breast cancer cell line expressing estrogen receptor: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells up to 48 hours following treatment with estradiol (E2). ERs facilitate the transcriptional effects of hormones. These results, together with ChIP-PET results, suggest potential correlations between ER binding and gene regulation.
