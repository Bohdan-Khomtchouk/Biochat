TITLE
Dendritic cell response to measles virus infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) for up to 24 hours after infection with measles virus (MV). MV induces immunosuppression followed by lasting immunity. DCs appear to play a role in this effect. Results provide insight into MV-DC interactions and suggest mechanisms for MV-modulated immune response.
