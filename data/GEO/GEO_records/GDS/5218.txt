TITLE
Resistance exercise effect on skeletal muscles of young and old adults

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples from young (about 24 years old) and old (about 84 years old) adults before and after 12 weeks of progressive resistance training. Results provide insight into the molecular adaptation of the young and old skeletal muscle to resistance training.
