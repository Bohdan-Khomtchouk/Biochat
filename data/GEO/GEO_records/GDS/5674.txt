TITLE
ErbB4 isoforms CYT-1 and CYT-2 overexpression effect on MCF10A mammary epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A cells expressing ERBB4 intracellular domain (ICD) isoforms, CYT-1 or CYT-2. ERBB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. MCF10A cells lack endogenous ERBB4 expression. Results provide insight into the diverse transcriptional activities of ERBB4 isoforms.
