TITLE
Oncogenic BRAF harboring melanoma cell line response to BRAF inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of A375 melanoma cells harboring the BRAF V600E oncogenic mutation following treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Results provide insight into the role of the BRAF V600E oncogene in the pathogenesis of melanoma.
