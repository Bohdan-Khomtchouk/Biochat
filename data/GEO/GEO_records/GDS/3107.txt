TITLE
Suprachiasmatic nucleus response to a light pulse

SUMMARY
Analysis of suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCNs) of animals exposed to a 30 minute light pulse 1 hour after lights off. Circadian rhythms in mammals are driven by a clock located in the SCN. Results provide insight into the molecular events governing the response of the SCN to photic input.
