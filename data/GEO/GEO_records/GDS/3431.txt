SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from males fed a high polyunsaturated diet containing 70% corn oil to induce the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NASH, steatosis is accompanied by inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of NASH.
