TITLE
Myogenic differentiation timecourse (MG-U74C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of early stages of myogenesis. C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate and examined during cell proliferation (days -2 to -1), at cell cycle withdrawal (day 0) and during myogenic fusion and maturation of multinucleated myotubes (days 2 to 10).

ORGANISM
