TITLE
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 inhibition effect on clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells treated with A939572, a stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) inhibitor. SCD1 is overexpressed in ccRCC.Results provide insight into the role of SCD1 in the pathogenesis of ccRCC.
