TITLE
LIGHT overexpressing T cells and a high fat diet effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of Lck-LIGHT transgenics fed a high fat diet. Lck-LIGHT animals overexpress LIGHT, a tumor necrosis factor cytokine family member, in T cells and develop hyperlipidemia. Results provide insight into the role of T cells and liver in regulating lipid homeostasis mediated by LIGHT.
