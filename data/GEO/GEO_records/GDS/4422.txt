TITLE
Interleukin-25-induced pulmonary inflammation model: Type 2 myeloid cells and other inflammatory subsets

SUMMARY
Analysis of inflammatory cell types from lungs of 4get females that received daily intra-tracheal injections of IL-25 for 4 days to induce antigen-independent type 2 inflammation. Results provide insight into role of IL-25 and its receptor in innate and adaptive pulmonary type 2 immune responses.
