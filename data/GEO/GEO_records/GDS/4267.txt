TITLE
Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and non-systemic JIA subtypes: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) or non-sJIA. sJIA patients have significantly increased expansion of  immature PBMC subpopulations,  including CD34+ cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying sJIA pathogenesis.
