TITLE
Fetal and neonatal ductus arteriosus and aorta: endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the ductus arteriosus (DA) and aorta of fetuses and neonates. The DA, a fetal shunt artery between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, closes immediately after birth. Results provide insight into EC involvement in DA-specific morphology and function.
