TITLE
Interferon signaling in PIAS1 null mutants: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of bone marrow derived macrophages of PIAS1 null mutants treated with 500 U/ml interferon (IFN)-beta or 10 ng/ml IFN-gamma for 2 and 4 hours.  IFN activates the STAT pathway, which is negatively regulated by PIAS1.  Antiviral activity of IFN is enhanced in PIAS1 nulls.
