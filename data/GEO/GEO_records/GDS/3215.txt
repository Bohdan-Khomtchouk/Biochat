TITLE
13-cis retinoic acid effect on SEB-1 sebocyte cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured sebaceous gland cells (SEB-1 sebocytes) treated with 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cis RA, isotretinoin), a potent acne treatment agent that reduces the size and secretion of sebaceous glands. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for 13-cis RA's acne-clearing effect.
