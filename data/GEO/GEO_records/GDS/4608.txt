TITLE
Epidermal injury model

SUMMARY
Analysis of trypsin-disassociated keratinocytes (KCs) isolated from normal skin as a model for epidermal injury.  These sorted keratinocytes (KC sorted) were compared to KCs isolated by LCM (KC LCM) and long-term cultured KCs (KC in vitro). Results provide insight into the KC injury response.
