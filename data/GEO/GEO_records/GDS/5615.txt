TITLE
Oral histone deacetylase inhibitor ST7612AA1 effect on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in vitro models

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphoma cell lines DOHH2 (derived from GCB-DLBCL) and TMD8 (derived from ABC-DLBCL) exposed to ST7612AA1 (300nM) for 8 hrs. ST7612AA1 is an oral thiol-based histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ST7612AA1 action in DLBCL.
