TITLE
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor depletion effect on kidney cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 kidney cells depleted for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF depletion in HEK293 cells result in G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this cell cycle arrest.
