TITLE
Morbidly obese insulin-resistant patients: omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from body mass index (BMI)-matched, obese patients who were insulin-sensitive versus insulin-resistant, thereby eliminating obesity as a variable.  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms mediating obesity-related insulin resistance.
