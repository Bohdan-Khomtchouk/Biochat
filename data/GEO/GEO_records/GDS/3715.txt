TITLE
Insulin effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from insulin-sensitive subjects, insulin-resistant subjects, and  diabetic patients, following insulin treatment. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of insulin action in skeletal muscle and the underlying defects causing insulin resistance.
