TITLE
Alzheimer's disease: neurofibrillary tangles

SUMMARY
Analysis of entorhinal cortex neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) from 10 mid-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Comparison with histopathologically normal neurons from the same patients and brain region. Results provide insight into the formation of NFTs in AD.
