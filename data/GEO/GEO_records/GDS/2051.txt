TITLE
Peritoneal mesotheliomas induced by o-nitrotoluene and bromochloracetic acid: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of peritoneal mesotheliomas induced by various concentrations of o-nitrotoluene (o-NT) or bromochloracetic acid (BCA). o-NT is a high production chemical. BCA is a by-product of drinking water disinfection. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying mesothelioma formation.
