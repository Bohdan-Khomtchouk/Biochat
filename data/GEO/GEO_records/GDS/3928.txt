TITLE
Heavy metal effect on liver derived cell line H4-II-E-C3

SUMMARY
Analysis of H4-II-E-C3 liver-derived cells exposed to toxic heavy metals: nickel II chloride (NiCl2), cadmium chloride (CdCl2), or sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7), at various concentrations (based on viability assays). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Ni, Cd and Cr toxicity.
