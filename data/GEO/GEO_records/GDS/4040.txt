TITLE
Leukemia in Cbfb+/MYH11 embryos: peripheral blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood from Cbfb+/MYH11 and Cbfb-/- E12.5 embryos with that of their wildtype littermates. Cbfb+/MYH11 embryos had defects in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Results provide insight into the mechanisms by which CBFB-MYH11 may contribute to leukemogenesis.
