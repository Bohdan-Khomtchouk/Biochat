TITLE
Bacteriophage T4 infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultures at various time points during the course of bacteriophage T4 infection. T4-encoded transcriptional regulators modify and redirect host RNA polymerase to bind certain viral promoter classes. Results provide insight into the temporal classes of T4 RNA produced during development.

ORGANISM
Enterobacteria phage T4

PLATFORM
GPL3063 : Integrated Genomics Bacteriophage T4 2K Genome Array
