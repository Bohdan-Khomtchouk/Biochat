TITLE
Low and high aerobic exercise capacity strains: skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastrocnemius muscle from strains of low and high inherited aerobic exercise capacity; these strains also differ in their risk for metabolic syndrome. Results provide insight into the link between oxygen metabolism and metabolic disease risk factors.
