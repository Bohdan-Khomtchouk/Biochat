TITLE
Thiol-disulfide status effect on the leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 hour. DTT is a sulfhydryl reagent that serves as a nonphysiological redox donor and substrate for thioredoxins. Results provide insight into the contribution of changes in transcripts levels to the regulation of metabolism by thioredoxin.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
