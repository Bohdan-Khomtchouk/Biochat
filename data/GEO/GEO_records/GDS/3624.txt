TITLE
Neurotrophin-3 effect on ovaries in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 day old ovaries cultured in the presence of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) for 2 days.  Neurotrophins are growth factors involved in promoting cell survival and differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of NT3 in ovarian primordial follicle development.
