TITLE
Staphylococcal superantigen toxins effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with the recombinant staphylococcal superantigen (SAg) toxin SEI or SEB. SEI is located in the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc). Antibodies against non-egc SAgs are common in the healthy population, while those against egc SAgs are rare.
