TITLE
Fibroblast cell line response to two and three dimensional collagen-glycosaminoglycan culture environments

SUMMARY
Analysis of IMR-90 fibroblasts cultured in a two- or a three-dimensional collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) environment. The 3-D presentation of collagen-GAG stimulates increased fibroblast remodeling activity. Results provide insight into molecular changes elicited by the 3-D collagen-GAG interface.
