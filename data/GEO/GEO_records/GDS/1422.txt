TITLE
Parous mammary gland response to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary gland from parous or virgin Lewis animals 3 weeks after treatment with 50 mg/kg of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, a carcinogen. Full-term pregnancy early in life is associated with a reduced chance of developing breast cancer.
