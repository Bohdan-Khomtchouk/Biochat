TITLE
Embryonic kidney: ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme (MOE430 2.0)

SUMMARY
Analysis of ureteric bud (UB) tips and stalks and metanephric mesenchyme (MM) from E12.5 kidneys. UB-secreted factors induce conversion of adjacent MM cells into nephrons. Results identify as potential regulators a set of 20 secreted molecules specific to the UB and conserved between species.
