TITLE
Serum response factor SRF induction in embryonic stem cells: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryonic stem (ES) cells following stimulation with fetal bovine serum at various time points up to 180 minutes.  Expression in wild type ES cells compared to that in Srf homozygous mutants with or without an SRF transgene.  Results identify potential targets of SRF.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
