TITLE
Macrophage response to H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viral infections

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophages at 1, 3, and 6 hours post-infection with H1N1 or H5N1 viruses in vitro. The avian H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic, while the swine H1N1 virus is less so. Alveolar macrophages are targets of H5N1. Results provide insight into the host response to H1N1 and H5N1 infections.
