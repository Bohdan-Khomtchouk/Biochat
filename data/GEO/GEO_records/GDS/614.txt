TITLE
Dystrophin-deficient mdx extraocular muscle development time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of extraocular muscle (EOM) from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model. Postnatal ages 14, 28, 56, and 112 days examined. EOM is unaffected in DMD, so results provide insight into mdx EOM protective mechanisms.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
