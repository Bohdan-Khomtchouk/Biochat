TITLE
Histone H3 and H4 amino terminal deletions

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of H3 and H4 amino terminal deletion mutants grown under conditions of amino acid starvation, which induce Gcn4p activated transcription. Results provide insight into the contribution of histone amino termini modifications to gene expression.
