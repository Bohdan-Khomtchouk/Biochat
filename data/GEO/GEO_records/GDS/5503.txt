TITLE
Small molecule GW8510 effect on pancreatic beta cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic beta cells treated with GW8510, a CDK2 inhibitor. Insulin expression is largely restricted to pancreatic beta cells. These results, together with those of GDS5502, provide insight into potential mechanisms of insulin induction by non-beta pancreatic cell types.
