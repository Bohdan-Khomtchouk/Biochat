TITLE
Age effect on skeletal muscle precursor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS-sorted CD45-Ter119-Sca-1-CD29+Cxcr4+ skeletal muscle precursor (SMP) cells from young, middle-aged, and old C57BL/6 males. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related skeletal muscle and stem cell dysfunction.
