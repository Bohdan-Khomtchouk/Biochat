TITLE
Various weak organic acids effect on anaerobic yeast chemostat cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of anaerobic chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisae exposed to one of several weak organic acids. Weak organic acids are used as preservatives in food and beverages. Yeasts are able to proliferate at the maximum legal dosage of such preservatives.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
