TITLE
Night and day effects on pineal gland (Expt. B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pineal glands from Sprague-Dawley rats at mid-day (ZT7) or midnight (ZT19).  Similar samples from pineal gland-specific DNF2 transgenic rats also examined. The pineal plays a vital role in vertebrate chronobiology. Results provide insight into night/day changes in pineal gene expression.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
