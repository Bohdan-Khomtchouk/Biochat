TITLE
Inflammatory amnion mesenchymal cell model response to interleukin-1β: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of monolayer cultures of amnion mesenchymal cells (AMC) following interleukin-1β challenge for up to 8 hrs. These AMCs represent an in vitro model system by which to study the inflammatory component of labor. Results provide insight into molecular response of AMCs to cytokine challenge.
