TITLE
Air pollutant and oxidized lipid effect on microvascular endothelial cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of microvascular endothelial cells treated at various concentrations of the model air pollutant diesel exhaust particles (DEP), an oxidized phospholipid (ox-PAPC), or both. Results provide insight into the synergistic effect of DEP and ox-PAPC in promoting vascular inflammation.
