TITLE
DNA gyrase inhibition effect on recA, topA, and dnaC mutants: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of recA, topA, and dnaC single mutants at various time points up to 20 minutes following treatment with norfloxacin to inhibit DNA gyrase. recA, topA, and dnaC mutants are deficient DNA repair, DNA relaxation and DNA replication, respectively.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
