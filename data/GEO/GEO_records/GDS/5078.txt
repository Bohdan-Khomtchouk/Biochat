TITLE
Fra-1 deficient lung response to fibrotic agent bleomycin

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from Fra-1 deficient mutants 5 days following intratracheal administration of bleomycin to induce lung fibrosis. Fra-1 is a b-ZIP transcription factor. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Fra-1 protects against bleomycin-induced lung injury.
