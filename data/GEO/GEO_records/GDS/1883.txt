TITLE
Sodium tungstate regenerative effect on diabetic pancreas

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas of diabetic animals after treatment with sodium tungstate, which induces beta cell mass growth. Diabetes induced by streptozotocin. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the regenerative effect of sodium tungstate on the pancreas of models of diabetes.
