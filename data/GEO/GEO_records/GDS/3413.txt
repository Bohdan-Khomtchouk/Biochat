TITLE
Homocysteine effect on aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells grown for 14 days in the presence of 10 or 100 umol/L DL-homocysteine (Hcy). Elevated plasma levels of Hcy are a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. Results provide insight into the role of Hcy in atherosclerosis.
