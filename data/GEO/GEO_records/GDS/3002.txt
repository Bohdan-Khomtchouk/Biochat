TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibitors effect on osteoblast differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid for 18 hours under osteogenic conditions. HDIs accelerate osteoblast maturation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying osteoblast differentiation.
