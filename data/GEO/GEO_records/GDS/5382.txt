TITLE
Transcription factor Tcfap2c deficiency effect on primordial germ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depleted for transcription factor Tcfap2c and PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) derived from the Tcfap2c-deficient ESCs. TFAP2C is a member of the activator protein-2 (AP-2) family.  Results provide insight into the role of TFAP2C in germ cell fate.
