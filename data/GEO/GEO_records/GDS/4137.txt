TITLE
Nasu-Hakola disease model: DAP12 knockdown THP-1 clones

SUMMARY
Analysis of DAP12-deficient acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells that serve as a model of NHD, following treatment with 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).  PMA is a known inducer of morphological differentiation of THP-1 cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying NHD pathology.
