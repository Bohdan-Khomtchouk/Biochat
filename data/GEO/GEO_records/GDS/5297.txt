TITLE
Fezf2 overexpresson effect on cortical neural progenitors in vivo: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cortical neural progenitor cells overexpressing forebrain expressed zinc finger 2 (Fezf2) for 24 and 48 hours. Fezf2 expression vectors delivered to cells in utero. Results provide insight into the role of Fezf2 in the differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons from progenitors.
