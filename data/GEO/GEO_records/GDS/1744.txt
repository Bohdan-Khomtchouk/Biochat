TITLE
COP9 signalosome subunit 4 CSN4 mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 7-day-old light-grown csn4-1 mutant seedlings. CSN4 is subunit 4 of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a multifunctional protein complex of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CSN is essential for development, but little is known about the specific role of its eight subunits.

ORGANISM
