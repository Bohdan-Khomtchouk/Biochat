TITLE
Addictive drugs effect on brain striatum: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain striata of C57BL/6J animals treated for up to 8 hours with cocaine, ethanol, heroin, methamphetamine, morphine, or nicotine. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying addiction to different classes of drugs of abuse.
