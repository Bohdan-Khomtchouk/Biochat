TITLE
E-cadherin/CDH1 intron2 protein isoform overexpression in Mkn28 gastric tubular adenocarcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MKN28 cell line (E-cadherin positive) overexpressing E-cadherin isoform CDH1a. CDH1a overexpression promotes mild MKN28 aggregation and increases invasion. Results provide insight into role of CDH1a as a negative modulator of canonical E-cadherin function in cancer cells.
