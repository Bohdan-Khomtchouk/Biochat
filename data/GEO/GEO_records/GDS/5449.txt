TITLE
Mek1 Mek2 double mutation effect on the embryonic brain dorsal cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain dorsal cortices of E18.5 embryos deleted for Mek1 and Mek2, dual specificity kinases. Mek1 and Mek2 are components of the RAF/MEK/ERK singaling pathway. Results provide insight into the role of Mek1 and Mek2 in gliogenesis.
