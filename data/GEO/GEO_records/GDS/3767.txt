TITLE
Zinc finger transcription factor PLAGL2 effect on primary p53-null neural stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PlagL2-transduced, p53-null neural stem cells (NSCs) following differentiation induction. PLAGL2 strongly suppresses NSC differentiation while promoting self-renewal capacity. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this differentiation-suppressive activity.
