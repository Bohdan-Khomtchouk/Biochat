TITLE
c-Myc transgenic model of lung adenocarcinomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of cancerous lungs of transgenics overexpressing the c-Myc proto-oncogene in their alveolar epithelia. This overexpression results in bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma and papillary adenocarcinoma. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc effects tumorigenesis.
