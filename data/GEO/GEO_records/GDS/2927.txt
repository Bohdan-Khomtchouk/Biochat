TITLE
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin effect on the ovary: dose response (I)

SUMMARY
Analysis of ovaries following exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at concentrations of up to 100 parts per billion (ppb). TCDD is a reproductive toxicant and endocrine disruptor in vertebrates. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying TCDD toxicity.
