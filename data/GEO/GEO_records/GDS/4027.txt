TITLE
In vitro expanded and re-differentiated pancreatic islet cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of fresh pancreatic islets, expanded islet cells, and re-differentiated cells.  Three different protocols were used to expand pancreatic islets, followed by attempts at redifferentiation back to islets. Results provide insight into active pathways in expanded and redifferentiated islets.
