TITLE
MOSE model of ovarian cancer progression: epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells at various stages (early, intermediate, and late) as they transition from a pre-neoplastic/non-malignant state to a malignant/invasive state. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of ovarian cancer.
