TITLE
Insectide chlorpyrifos effect on the brain: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain frontal lobes of animals treated with chlorpyrifos (CPF) at doses up to 30 mg/kg. Subtoxic exposure to CPF, an organophosphorus insecticide, has long-term adverse effects on brain development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.
