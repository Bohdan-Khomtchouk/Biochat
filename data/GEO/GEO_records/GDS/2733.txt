TITLE
Cytosine arabinoside effect on Ewing's sarcoma cell line: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ewing’s sarcoma A673 cells for up to 5 days after treatment with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) at EC50 or twice the EC50. ARA-C identified as a modulator of the Ewing’s sarcoma EWS/FLI fusion protein. Results provide insight into the specificity of the response of A673 cells to ARA-C.
