TITLE
Fear conditioning effect on hybrid mouse diversity panel: hippocampus and striatum

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole hippocampus and striatum from Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) males exposed to a fear conditioning procedure. The HMDP panel 29 classical inbred strains and 71 recombinant inbred strains. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying fear phenotypes.
