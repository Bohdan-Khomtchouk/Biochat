TITLE
Breast cancer metastases from different anatomical sites: fine-needle aspiration biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer (BC) metastases from different anatomical sites collected prior to treatment.  The anatomical location of the metastatic lesion is associated with length of survival post-recurrence. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying BC site-specific metastases.
