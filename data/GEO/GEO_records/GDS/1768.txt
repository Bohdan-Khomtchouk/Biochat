TITLE
Platelet-derived growth factor effect on fibroblasts: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of AG01518 foreskin fibroblasts at various time points up to 24 hours following stimulation with 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts and other cells of mesenchymal origin. Results identify genes regulated by PDGF.
