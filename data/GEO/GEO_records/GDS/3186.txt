TITLE
Photoreceptor degeneration model: retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas from adult protocadherin 21 (prCAD) mutants. The prCAD mutant is a model for inherited photoreceptor degeneration. prCAD is required for the assembly and integrity of the photoreceptor outer segment. Results compared with those from light damaged retinas (GDS3187).
