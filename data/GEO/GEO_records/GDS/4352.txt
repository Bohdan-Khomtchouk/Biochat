TITLE
Cellular prion protein knockout effect on developing hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi from cellular prion protein (PrPC)-deficient, FVB newborns (4.5-day-old) and adults (3-mo-old). PrPc protein is widely expressed throughout the CNS; mice lacking PrP are resistant to prion infection. Results provide insight into the influence of PrPC on the developing CNS.
