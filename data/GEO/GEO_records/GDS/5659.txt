TITLE
Rho-associated kinase deficiency effect on coronary artery smooth muscle cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells following knockdown of Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1). ROCK1 phosphorylates and activates zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK). These results, together with those from GDSxxxx, provide further insight into ROCK1 and ZIPK functions.
