TITLE
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2’deoxycytidine effect on partially-ligated left carotid artery

SUMMARY
Analysis of arteries from C57BL/6 males pretreated with DNMT inhibitor 5Aza for 2 wk, then subjected to partial carotid ligation (PCL) and continued 5Aza treatment for 1 wk after ligation. PCL induces disturbed blood flow. Results provide insight into molecular basis of atherosclerosis development.
