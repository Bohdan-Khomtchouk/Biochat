TITLE
Eset depletion effect on embryonic stem cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells following shRNA knock-down of Eset. Eset is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase critical for development of the inner cell mass (ICM) from which ES cells are derived. Results provide insight into the role of Eset in ES cell differentiation.
