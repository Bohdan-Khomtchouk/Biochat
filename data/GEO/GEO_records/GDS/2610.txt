TITLE
Glycerol kinase deficiency effect on brown adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown adipose tissues from glycerol kinase (GK) knockout mutants. GK is at the interface of fat and carbohydrate metabolism and has been implicated in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results provide insight into the role of GK in insulin resistance.
