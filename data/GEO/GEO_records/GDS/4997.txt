TITLE
Lung epithelium cell line response to Influenza A virus (H3N2) non-structural 1 gene mutations

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 cells infected with H3N2 influenza isolate A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK-wt) or recombinant HK NS1 mutants. NS1 is a multifunctional virulence factor. These results, together with those from GDS4998, provide insight into molecular effects of NS1 mutation on human versus mouse host cells.
