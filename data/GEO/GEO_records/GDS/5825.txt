TITLE
Interleukin-1α deficiency effect on injured spinal cord

SUMMARY
Analysis of spinal cord segment from interleukin (IL)-1α -/- and IL-1β -/- C57BL/6 adults 24 hrs after spinal cord injury (SCI). IL-1α and IL-1β belong to a family of cytokines playing a key role in neurodegeneration. Results provide insight into the role of IL-1α in the neuropathology of SCI.
