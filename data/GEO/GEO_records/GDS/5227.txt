TITLE
3D-culture effect on fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs) cultured in 2D or in 3D on polyHEMA coated plates. FTSECs have been implicated as a cell-of-origin for high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial ovarovarian cancer.
