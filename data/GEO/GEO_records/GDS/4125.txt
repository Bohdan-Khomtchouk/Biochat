TITLE
Pten-null, K-ras-activated prostate cancer model

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate tumors from mutants with prostate-specific Pten loss and K-ras activation. In murine models, PTEN deletion alone fails to mimic end stage of human prostate cancer (PC). Results provide insight into cooperation between PTEN loss and RAS activation to promote EMT and metastasis.
