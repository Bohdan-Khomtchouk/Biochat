TITLE
Prostate cancer cell line response to dihydrotestosterone: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated with the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT binds to androgen receptor (AR), a ligand dependent transcription factor that plays a key role in prostate cancer. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying AR-dependent prostate cancer growth.
