TITLE
Egr-1 deficiency effect on retina during eye development

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas of Egr-1 deficient animals at post-natal days 30 and 42. 42 day-old Egr-1 knockout animals have longer eyes and a more myopic refractive error compared to wild-types. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating axial eye growth.
