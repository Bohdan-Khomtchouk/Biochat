TITLE
Hippocampus response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor soman: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of Sprauge-Dawley males for up to 168 hours following exposure to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor soman. Soman is a potent neurotoxicant. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of soman-induced neurodegeneration.
