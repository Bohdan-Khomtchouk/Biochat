SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from 2 week old animals exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) daily since birth. During infancy, exposure of humans to CS is associated with decreased lung function and increased incidences of respiratory illnesses. Results provide insight into the neonatal pulmonary response to CS.
