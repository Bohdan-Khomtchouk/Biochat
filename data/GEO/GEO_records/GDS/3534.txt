TITLE
Lymphatic endothelial cell response to Prox1 and NR2F2 depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) depleted for Prox1, NR2F2, or both regulators. LECs are derived from venous endothelial cells (VECs). Prox1 and NR2F2 regulate LEC and VEC development, respectively. Results provide insight into the role of NR2F2 and Prox1 in maintaining LEC phenotypes.
