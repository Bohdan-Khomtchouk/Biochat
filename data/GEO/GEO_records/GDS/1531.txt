TITLE
Chito-oligomer effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of 14-day-old Columbia-0 seedlings treated with hydrolyzed crab-shell chitin or chito-octamer. Chitin is a major component of fungal walls and insect exoskeletons. Results provide insight into the signaling pathways involved in activating defense genes in response to chito-oligomers.
