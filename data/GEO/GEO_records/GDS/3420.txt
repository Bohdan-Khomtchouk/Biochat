TITLE
Cadmium exposure: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of animals treated with 100 uM cadmium for 4 or 24 hours. Cadmium is a environmental toxicant. Exposure to cadmium is associated with a variety of human diseases. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the defense against cadmium toxicity.
