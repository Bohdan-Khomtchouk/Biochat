TITLE
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model during chronic and acute infection: splenic effector CD8 T cell types

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary effector (naive) and secondary effector (memory) CD8+ T cells at day 8 post-acute or post-chronic LCMV infection. Results provide insight into the response of memory CD8+ T cells to persistent antigen restimulation, in support of rational vaccine design for chronic infections.
