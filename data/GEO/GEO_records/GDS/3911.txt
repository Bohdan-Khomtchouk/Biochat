TITLE
StemRegenin 1 effect on hematopoietic stem cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) treated with StemRegenin 1 (SR1) and LGC006 (a less potent SR1 analog) at 30nM to 1000nM. The use of HSC transplants depends on the ability to expand these cells ex vivo.  Results provide insight into molecular basis of SR1-induced ex vivo HSC expansion.
