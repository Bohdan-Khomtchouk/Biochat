TITLE
Osteoarthritic acetabular labrum 3-D culture

SUMMARY
Analysis of osteoarthritic labrum cells cultured for 7 days in a 3-dimensional alginate bead system. The acetabular labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure that seals the hip joint. Results provide insight into hip OA-associated molecular changes in acetabular labrum cells.
