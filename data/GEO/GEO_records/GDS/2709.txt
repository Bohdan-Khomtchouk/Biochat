TITLE
Ventilator-associated lung induced injury resistant and sensitive strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from 2 strains exposed to high tidal volume mechanical ventilation. Examined strains consist of one that is resistant to ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) and another that is sensitive. Results provide insight into the genetic basis of susceptibility to VALI.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
