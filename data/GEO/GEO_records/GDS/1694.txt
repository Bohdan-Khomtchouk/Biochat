TITLE
Altered mitochondrial alternative oxidase expression effect on leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of five-week-old leaves under non-stress conditions from wild type gl1 and two transgenic lines that overexpress (S5) or inhibit (A1-1) mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) synthesis. Results provide insight into the role of AOX in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leaves.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
