TITLE
Estrogen effect on bone marrow-derived c-kit+ stem cells and CD44+ stromal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow (BM) c-kit+ stem cells (SCs) and CD44+ stromal cells (StroCs) after exposure to physiological dose of 17b-estradiol. Results provide insight into the role of estrogen in regulating the functional organization of the BM SC niche and into its role in cardiac repair.
