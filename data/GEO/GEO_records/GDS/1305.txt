TITLE
Pax6 mutation effect on brain development

SUMMARY
Analysis of forebrain and hindbrain of Small eye homozygous Pax6 mutants at embryonic day 12.5. Pax6 is a transcription factor important in the development of the brain, where it affects cell fate, cell proliferation, and patterning. Results identify targets of Pax6 in the developing brain.
