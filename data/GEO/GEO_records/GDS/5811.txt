TITLE
TGFβ1 effect on gingival fibroblasts pretreated with TGFβ-associated kinase 1 inhibitor 5Z-7-Oxozeanol

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured gingival fibroblasts pre-treated with TGFβ-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) inhibitor (5Z)-7-Oxozeanol for 45 min prior to treatment with TGFβ1. Results provide insight into the extent to which TAK1 mediates fibroproliferative responses in gingival fibroblasts in response to TGFβ1.
