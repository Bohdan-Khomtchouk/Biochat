TITLE
Transcription factor CREB depletion effect on myeloid leukemic cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of myeloid leukemia K562 cells depleted for cAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB), a transcription factor. CREB is overexpressed in bone marrow samples of patients with acute leukemia. Results provides insight into the molecular mechanisms by which CREB contributes to acute leukemia.
