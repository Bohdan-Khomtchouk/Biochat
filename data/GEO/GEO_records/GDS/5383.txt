TITLE
Interleukin-6 effect on interleukin-6 receptor α-deficient macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of interleukin-6 receptor α-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6). Cytokine IL-6 is linked to obesity, and macrophages are key mediators of obesity-associated inflammation. Results provide insight into the role of IL-6 in macrophages.
