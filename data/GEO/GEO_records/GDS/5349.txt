TITLE
Dendritic cell subsets

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS-sorted dermal macrophage, epidermal Langerhans and CD14+ dendritic cell (DC) subsets. DCs, monocytes and macrophages are leukocytes with critical roles in immunity. Result provide insight into molecular profiles distinguishing dermal DCs from monocyte-derived cells and macrophages.
