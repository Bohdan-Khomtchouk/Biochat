TITLE
Age effect on respiratory epithelium: distal trachea and carina region

SUMMARY
Analysis of distal trachea and carina region of young (2 month) and old (14 month) C57Bl/6 females. Aging lungs are associated with a variety of structural and pathologic changes. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying age-related changes in respiratory epithelium.
