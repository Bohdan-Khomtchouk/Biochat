TITLE
ErbB2/Neu and luteinizing hormone overexpression effect on the mammary gland: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary glands of 5 and 10-week-old bitransgenics overexpressing oncogenic ErbB2/Neu and luteinizing hormone (LH). Results provide insight into the effect of chronic trophic maintenance of the mammary epithelial cells, induced by LH, on ErbB2/Neu-initiated tumorigenesis.
