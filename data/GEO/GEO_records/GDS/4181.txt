TITLE
WHO 2008-classified acute myeloid leukemia subgroups (Analysis I): bone marrow mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of BMMCs from untreated patients diagnosed as AML-MLD-sole (AML with myelodysplasia-related changes solely because of multilineage dysplasia) or AML-NOS (AML-not otherwise specified) according to WHO 2008 guidelines. Results provide insight into the relevance of MLD for AML classification.

CITATIONS
Miesner M, Haferlach C, Bacher U, Weiss T et al. Multilineage dysplasia (MLD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) correlates with MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities and a prior history of MDS or MDS/MPN but has no independent prognostic relevance: a comparison of 408 cases classified as "AML not otherwise specified" (AML-NOS) or "AML with myelodysplasia-related changes" (AML-MRC).
