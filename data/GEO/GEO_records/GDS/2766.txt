TITLE
Dominant negative cJun effect on apolipoprotein E deficient livers

SUMMARY
Analysis of apolipoprotein E deficient livers from animals expressing a dominant negative cJun (dn-c-Jun). Lipoproteins transport cholesterol and other fats through the bloodstream. Results provide insight into the pathways involved in regulating plasma cholesterol that are affected by dn-c-Jun.
