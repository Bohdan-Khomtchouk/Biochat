TITLE
Ketogenic diet effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from animals fed a ketogenic diet (KD). KDs, diets that are high in fat and low in carbohydrates, are used as an approach to weight loss. Results provide insight into the KD-induced molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic state congruous with weight loss.
