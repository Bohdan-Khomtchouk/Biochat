TITLE
Quinazolone RVX-208 effect on liver carcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 liver carcinoma cells treated with the quinazolone RVX-208 or the triazolothienodiazepine JQ1, a BET bromodomain (BD) inhibitor. BET protein dysfunction is linked to cancer. Results provide insight into the difference in affinity of RVX-208 for the 1st and 2nd BDs in BET proteins.
