TITLE
Interferon induction by small hairpin RNA

SUMMARY
Embryonic lung fibroblasts (HLF) infected with control lentivirus, or lentivirus expressing MRG15 and MRGX small hairpin RNAs from the H1 polIII promoter. The MRG15 shRNA induces an interferon response that is unrelated to silencing of MRG15.
