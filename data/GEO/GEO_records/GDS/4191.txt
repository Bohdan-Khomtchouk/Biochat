TITLE
NZM2410-derived lupus susceptibility locus Sle2c1: peritoneal cavity B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peritoneal cavity B cells (B1a) and splenic B (sB) cells from B6.Sle2c1 mice. Sle2 induces expansion of the B1a cell compartment, a B cell defect consistently associated with lupus. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to lupus in the NZM2410 model.
