TITLE
Diabetic children: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from children (2-18 years) with newly diagnosed type 1 or 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D). One and 4 month samples were obtained from 20 of the T1D patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms that distinguish T1D and T2D and those that are common to both forms of diabetes.
