TITLE
Transcription factor Zfx deficiency effect on embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (SCs) lacking the transcription factor Zfx. Zfx is a zinc finger protein of the Zfy family, whose members are highly conserved in vertebrates. Results provide insight into the role of Zfx in embryonic and adult SC self-renewal.
