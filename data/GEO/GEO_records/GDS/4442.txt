TITLE
bHLH transcription factor Mesogenin1 ectopic expression effect on embryoid bodies: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryoid bodies following induction of ectopic Msgn1 expression for up to 48 hours. Msgn1, a bHLH transcription factor, is a target of Wnt3a, a signaling protein that functions in the segmentation clock and the determination front during somitogenesis.
