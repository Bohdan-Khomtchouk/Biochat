TITLE
Chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress imposed by misfolded surfactant protein C (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells that constitutively express misfolded surfactant protein C, which induces chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cytotoxicity. Results provide evidence for an NF-kB-dependent adaptive response to the chronic ER stress imposed by the misfolded protein.
