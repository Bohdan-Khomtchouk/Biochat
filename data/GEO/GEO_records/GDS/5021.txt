TITLE
Placenta response to maternal choline intake throughout the third trimester of pregnancy: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of placenta retrieved at delivery from healthy women who consumed up to 930mg choline/day throughout their third trimester of pregnancy. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the benefits of maternal choline supplementation on placental function.
