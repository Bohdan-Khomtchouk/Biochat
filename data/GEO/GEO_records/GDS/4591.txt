TITLE
Microchimeric fetal cells isolated from maternal lung during late pregnancy

SUMMARY
Analysis of fetal cells collected from C57BL/6J maternal lung in late stages of pregnancy. During pregnancy, fetal cells enter maternal circulation and organs leading to microchimerism. Results provide insight into the microchimeric cell types and the mechanisms by which they affect maternal health.
