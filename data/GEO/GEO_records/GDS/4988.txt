TITLE
Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 mutation effect on gonadal white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonadal white adipose tissues (WATs) of secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) mutants. Sfrp5 expression increases during adipogenesis and in the WATs of obese mice. The Sfrp5 mutation is a premature stop codon at Gln7. Results provide insight into the role of Sfrp5 in WAT biology.
