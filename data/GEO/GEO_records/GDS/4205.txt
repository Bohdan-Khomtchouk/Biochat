TITLE
Transcription factor c-JUN knockout effect on B lymphoid cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of B lymphoid cells depleted of activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor c-JUN. c-JUN is involved in BCR-ABL oncogene-induced transformation and leukemogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying c-JUN modulation of leukemogenesis.
