TITLE
Light-induced retinal damage

SUMMARY
Analysis of neurosensory retinas and retinal pigment epithelia from animals whose retinas were damaged by exposure to 10,000 lux cold white fluorescent light. Results provide insight into the molecular changes produced by damaging light levels in the retina.
