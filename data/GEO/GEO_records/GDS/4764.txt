TITLE
Dual specificity phosphatase-4 loss effect on basal-like breast cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell lines following DUSP4-knockdown or MAP-ERK kinase (MEK)-inhibition with AZD6244/selumetinib (up to 24hr). Results provide insight into role of DUSP4 in promoting cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in BLBC.
