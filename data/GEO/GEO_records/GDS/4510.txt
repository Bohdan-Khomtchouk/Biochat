TITLE
rd1 model of retinal degeneration: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of rd1 retinas starting at P2 (prior to obvious biochemical/morphological differences) and ending at P8 (early degenerative changes present, but prior to onset of rod photoreceptor cell death). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying photoreceptor development.
