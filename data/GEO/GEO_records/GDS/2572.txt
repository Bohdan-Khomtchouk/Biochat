TITLE
Tocopherol deficient mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of 1 and 3 day old seedlings disrupted for tocopherol cyclase (vte1) or homogentisate phytyl transferase (vte2). Both mutants lack tocopherols, but vte1 mutants accumulate the tocopherol pathway intermediate DMPBQ. Results provide insight into seedling response to tocopherol deficiency.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
