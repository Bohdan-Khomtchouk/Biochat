TITLE
Methyltransferase EZH2 inhibition effect on ARID1A mutated ovarian clear cell cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of ARID1A-mutated OVISE ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cells restored with wild-type ARID1A or treated with GSK126, an inhibitor of epigenetic regulator EZH2. Epigenetic modifier ARID1A is often mutated in OCCC. Results provide insight into the role of epigenetic mechanisms in OCCC.
