TITLE
Maternal voluntary consumption model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: adult offspring brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain from adult (postnatal day 70) male offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol via voluntary maternal consumption from gestational day 0 to pup postnatal day 10. Results provide insight into molecular basis of long-term persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioral alterations.
