TITLE
Estrogen or insulin-like growth factor I stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2) or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) for up to 24 hours. E2 and IGF-I signaling are important for normal mammary development and breast cancer. Results provide insight into the  cross-talk between these pathways.
