TITLE
Fibrosarcoma cell line response to various cytostatic drugs

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells following exposure to the cytostatic chemotherapeutic agents actinomycin D or vincristine for 24 hours, or doxorubicin for 6 and 24 hours. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell death in response to cytotoxic therapies.
