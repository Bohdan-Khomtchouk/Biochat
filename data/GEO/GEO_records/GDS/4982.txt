TITLE
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines response to antibodies against CD20 or B-cell receptor

SUMMARY
Analysis of NHL lines treated with CD20 or B-cell receptor (BCR) antibodies. CD20 is a B cell-specific, cell surface protein; BCR has a key role in B cell development. Results provide insight into concordance in molecular changes following BCR activation and anti-CD20 Ab treatment in lymphoma cells.
