TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to shift from anaerobic to aerobic growth: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures at various time points up to 120 minutes following a shift from anaerobic to aerobic growth. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response of shifted yeast cells to oxidative stress.
