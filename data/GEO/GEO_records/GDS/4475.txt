TITLE
Extracellular matrix protein cysteine rich 61 (CCN1) effect on LN229 glioma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of LN229 glioma cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of Cyr61 (CCN1), induced for 24h with doxycycline. CCN1 expression may reduce efficacy of oncolytic HSV-1 brain cancer therapy. Results provide insight into CCN1-mediated oncolytic HSV-1 inhibition.
