TITLE
Hippocampal neural progenitor cell response to the small molecule KHS101: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampal neural progenitor cells treated with 1.7 or 5 uM KHS101. KHS101 is a synthetic 4-aminothiazole analog that induces the neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of KHS101.
