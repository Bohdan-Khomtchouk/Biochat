TITLE
GFAP-negative lamina cribrosa cell response to TGF-beta1

SUMMARY
Analysis of glial fibrillary acidic acid (GFAP)-negative lamina cribrosa (LC) glial cell response to 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 24 hours. This is a model for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in which TGF-beta levels are elevated in human LC tissue.
