TITLE
Transcription factors Nanog and Oct4 knockdown effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells following RNA interference-mediated depletion of Nanog or Oct4. Nanog and Oct4 are required to maintain the pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells. Differentially expressed genes scanned for the presence of binding sites for Nanog and Oct4.
