TITLE
Type 2 diabetic obese patients: visceral adipose tissue CD14+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of visceral adipose tissue CD14+ cells isolated from obese, type 2 diabetic patients. Obesity is marked by changes in the immune cell composition of adipose tissue. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of proinflammatory cytokine production in obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.
