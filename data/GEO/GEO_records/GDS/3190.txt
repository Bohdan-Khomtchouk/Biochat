TITLE
Macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-10 co-treatment: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient macrophages at various time points up to 30 minutes following co-stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-10. LPS elicits an inflammatory response. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10.
