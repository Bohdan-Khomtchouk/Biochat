TITLE
Histone deacetylase Sirt1 overexpression effect on the heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic hearts overexpressing Sirt1, a class III histone deacetylase. Sirt1 protects against apoptosis and mediates the survival of cardiac myocytes and neurons under stress in vitro. Results provide insight into the in vivo function of Sirt1 in the heart.
