TITLE
Anisomycin effect on leukemia cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of myeloid leukemia U937 cells treated with anisomycin for various time points up to 6 hours. Anisomycin is a potent inducer of apoptosis. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of anisomycin in inducing apoptosis.
