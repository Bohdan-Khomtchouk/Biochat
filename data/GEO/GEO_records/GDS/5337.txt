TITLE
Heat shock protein 90 inhibitor effect on Huntington’s disease model: brain striatum

SUMMARY
Analysis of R6/2 Huntington’s disease (HD) model treated with 12mg/kg HSP990 for 4h. HSP990, a brain-penetrant HSP90 inhibitor, activates heat shock response (HSR) and alters HD-related phenotypes. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying impaired HSR-mediated HD progression.
