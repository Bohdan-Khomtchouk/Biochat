TITLE
Androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cell lines: expression profiles

SUMMARY
Analysis of androgen sensitive (AS) and insensitive (AI) prostate cancer cell lines. Despite the wide use of these cell lines as model systems, a global genotypic characterization of these cell lines is currently lacking. Results identify differences in gene expression profiles.
