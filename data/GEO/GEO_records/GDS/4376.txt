TITLE
Ts65Dn aneuploidy model of Down syndrome: skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of soleus muscle, in the basal state, from five-month-old Ts65Dn Down syndrome (DS) males. Ts65Dn DS model exhibits muscle weakness in vivo. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying DS-associated muscle dysfunction.
