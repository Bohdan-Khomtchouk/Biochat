TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast response to adenoviral vector infection (Mu11K-B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary C57BL/6 embryonic fibroblasts infected with a 1st generation adenoviral (Ad) vector. Ad vectors are known to induce certain genes and impact innate response networks. Results provide insight into the innate immune response of cells to Ad transduction.
