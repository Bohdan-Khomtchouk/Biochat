TITLE
Alpha-tropomyosin mutant models of familial cardiac hypertrophy

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventricles of mutants with mild ventricular disorganization and limited hypertrophy or with severe hypertrophy and fibrosis. Mutants possess familial cardiac hypertrophy (CH) associated mutations in alpha-tropomyosin. Results provide insight into mechanisms that mediate the onset of CH.
