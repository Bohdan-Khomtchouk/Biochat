TITLE
Notch receptors and Delta ligand interaction effect

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell mixtures consisting of cultured S2 cells expressing the full length (NFull) or C-terminal truncated Notch (NDCterm) and S2 cells expressing the ligand Delta. NFull and Delta interaction induce epidermal differentiation, while NDCterm and Delta induce neuronal differentiation.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
