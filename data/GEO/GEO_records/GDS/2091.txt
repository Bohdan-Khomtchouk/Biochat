TITLE
DNA demethylation effect on terminally differentiated cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts treated with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2dC). DNA methylation contributes to transcriptional silencing. Results identify genes whose expression is inhibited by DNA methylation in terminally differentiated cells.
