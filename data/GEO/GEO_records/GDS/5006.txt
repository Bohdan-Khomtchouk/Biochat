TITLE
Dietary probiotic Lactobacillus effect on N2 wildtype strain: adult developmental stage

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult worms fed live lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 or CNCM I-4317 for 10 days. L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 protects against oxidative stress and increases lifespan in worms. Results provide insight into probiotic LAB-induced oxidative stress protection.
