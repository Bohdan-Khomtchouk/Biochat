TITLE
Resting and activated natural killer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of resting and activated natural killer (NK) cells. Activated NK cells can use the granule exocytosis pathway to kill target cells upon recognition, resting NK cells are minimally cytotoxic. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the cytotoxicity displayed by NK cells.

ORGANISM
