TITLE
Pacing-induced heart failure model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of animals subjected to chronic cardiac pacing for 3 or 4 weeks. The transition from compensated dysfunction to decompensated heart failure (HF) occurs between the third and fourth week of pacing. Results provide insight into the progression to decompensated HF.
