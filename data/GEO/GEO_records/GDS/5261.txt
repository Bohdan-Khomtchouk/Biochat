TITLE
Interleukin 4, interleukin 13 and tumor necrosis factor-α effect on Matrigel-cultured IMR-90 lung fibroblast cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of IMR-90 cells cultured on Matrigel and treated with IL-4, IL-13 or TNFα. Type 2 inflammatory processes mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 are implicated in pathologic lung fibrogenesis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and maintenance of pulmonary fibrosis.
