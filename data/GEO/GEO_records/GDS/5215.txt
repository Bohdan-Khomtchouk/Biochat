TITLE
Molecular hydrogen-saturated water consumption effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of Sprague-Dawley animals following consumption of water containing 0.7 mM dissolved molecular hydrogen for 4 weeks. Molecular hydrogen is an antioxidant. Results provide insight into the molecular response of the liver to hydrogen saturated water.
