TITLE
Effect of estrogen receptor- or retinoic acid receptor-knockdown on estrogen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells transfected with control siRNA, estrogen receptor α (ER) siRNA or retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) siRNA. Basal proliferation of MCF7 cells was diminished by knocking down ER or RARα. Results provided insight into the molecular basis of basal proliferation.
