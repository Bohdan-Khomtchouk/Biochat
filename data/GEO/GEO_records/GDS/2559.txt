TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibition effect on seeds (I)

SUMMARY
Analysis of seeds imbibed for 3 days in the presence of trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase. Results provide insight into the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression during seed germination.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
