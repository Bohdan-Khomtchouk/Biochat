TITLE
Neurogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) treated with  dimethylsulphoxide and butylated hydroxyanisole (DMSO/BHA) for 6 or 48 hours to fetal brain (positive control) or adult liver (negative control). Results raise doubts about the DMSO/BHA protocol for generating neural cells from MSCs.
