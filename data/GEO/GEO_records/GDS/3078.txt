TITLE
High fat diet effect on the skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles of C57BL/6J animals fed a low or high fat diet for 3 or 28 days. Oversupply of lipid to skeletal muscle can result in insulin resistance, a characteristic of metabolic syndrome (MS). Results provide insight into the molecular events underlying the early onset of MS.
