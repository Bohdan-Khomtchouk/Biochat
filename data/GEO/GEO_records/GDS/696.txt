TITLE
Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by fibronectin

SUMMARY
Examination of neonatal ventricular myocytes plated on fibronectin coated dishes. Fibronectin elicits a hypertrophic response by clustering integrin receptors.  Results provide insight into molecular events underlying cardiac hypertrophy.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL341 : [RAE230A] Affymetrix Rat Expression 230A Array
