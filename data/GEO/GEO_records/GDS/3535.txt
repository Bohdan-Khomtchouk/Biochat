TITLE
Greening after extended darkness 1 (ged1) mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of ged1 mutant seedlings grown for 5 days in the dark followed by 2 days in the light. The ged1 mutant showed an enhanced ability to green on illumination after prolonged darkness. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the enhanced greening ability of ged1 seedlings.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
