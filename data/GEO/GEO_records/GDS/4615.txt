TITLE
Adult retina response to light

SUMMARY
Analysis of ex-vivo retinas collected from Long Evans adults kept all night in the dark and then exposed either for 3 hours (3 ZT) or 6 hours (6 ZT) to a 1000 lux light. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying adult retinal light adaptation.
