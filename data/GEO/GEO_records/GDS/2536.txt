TITLE
Nickel effect on endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with nickel chloride. Nickel compounds, important carcinogens and inducers of contact allergy reactions, are activators of endothelial cells. Results provide insight into the signaling pathways mediating the cellular responses to nickel.
