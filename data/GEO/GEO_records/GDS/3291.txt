TITLE
Myelomonocytic lymphoma U937 cell line response to mild hyperthermia

SUMMARY
Analysis of myelomonocytic lymphoma U937 cells subjected to mild hyperthermia. Mild hyperthermia alone does not induce apoptosis but it does show a synergism with radiotherapy and anti-cancer drugs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to mild hyperthermia.
