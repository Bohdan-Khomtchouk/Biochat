TITLE
Kidney isografts from brain dead donors

SUMMARY
Analysis of isografted kidneys from brain dead donors. Brain death in donors triggers nonspecific inflammatory events that increase the kinetics and intensity of the immunologic response in recipients after kidney transplantation. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying this response.

ORGANISM
