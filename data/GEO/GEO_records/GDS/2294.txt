TITLE
Histone deacetylase 1 deficient embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells lacking histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from core histones resulting in chromatin compaction. Results provide insight into the role of HDAC1 in transcriptional regulation.
