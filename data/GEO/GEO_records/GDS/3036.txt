TITLE
HOXB4 induction effect on embryoid bodies

SUMMARY
Analysis of ES cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) following transcriptional induction of homeobox transcription factor HOXB4. HOXB4 induction increases production of hematopoietic progenitors within EBs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying HOXB4-induced stem cell expansion.
