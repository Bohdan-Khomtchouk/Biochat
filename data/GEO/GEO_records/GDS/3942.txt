TITLE
Aging effect on bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow-derived, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly donors. Aged HSCs are increased in frequency and are less quiescent than young HSCs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the hematopoietic aging phenotype.
