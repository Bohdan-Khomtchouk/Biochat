TITLE
HIV-1 infection effect on macrophages in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured macrophages for up to 7 days after HIV-1 infection. Macrophages are targets of HIV-1 infection and constitute a viral reservoir that facilitates the spread of HIV-1 to other cells. Results provide insight into the signaling networks affected by HIV-1 infection in macrophages.
