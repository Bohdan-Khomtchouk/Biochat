TITLE
Conventional cigarette or modified-risk tobacco product smoke effect on lung bronchial epithelium: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of left lung bronchi from males that were nose-only exposed for 28 days to smoke from reference cigarette 3R4F at doses up to 23ug nicotine/l or from a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) at a dose of 23ug nicotine/l. Results provide insight into the reduced biological activity of MRTP.
