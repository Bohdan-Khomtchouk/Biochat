TITLE
Chemoresistant glioblastomas: expression profile

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of cell lines derived from primary and recurrent glioblastomas with resistance to O6-alkylating agents, BCNU and TMZ. Chemoresistance to these widely-used drugs is a major obstacle to tumor treatment. Results identify a transcriptomic signature of resistance to alkylating agents.
