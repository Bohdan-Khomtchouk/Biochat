TITLE
Dendritic cell response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation

SUMMARY
Analysis of MACS-sorted splenic dendritic cells (DC) from aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) +/+, C57BL6 females after 24hr in vivo treatment with TCDD.  The TCDD ligand is an AHR agonist and a potent immunotoxicant. Results provide insight into the consequences of TCDD-induced AHR activation in DCs.
