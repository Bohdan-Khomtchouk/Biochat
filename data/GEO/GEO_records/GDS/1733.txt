TITLE
Heat shock transcription factor HSF1 depleted cells response to heat shock: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HSF1-depleted HeLa cells at various time points up to 24 hours following heat shock treatment at 43 degrees C. Heat shock transcription factor HSF1 silenced using RNA interference (siHSF1_1, siHSF1_2). Results provide insight into the structure and function of the HSF1 signaling network.
