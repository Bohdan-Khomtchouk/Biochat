TITLE
Glioblastoma brain tumors

Analysis of glioblastoma (GBM) tumors from different regions of the brain from patients of various ages. Mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 define distinct epigenetic and biological subgroups of GBM. Results provide insight into heterogeneity of GBM and oncogenic pathways leading to gliomagenesis.
