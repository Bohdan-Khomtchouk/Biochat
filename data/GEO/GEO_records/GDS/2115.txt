TITLE
Developing mammary gland: terminal end buds and ducts

SUMMARY
Comparison of terminal end buds (TEBs) and ducts from 5-week-old mammary glands. TEBs and ducts perform specialized functions for ductal invasion and branching. Results provide insight into the epithelial-stromal crosstalk that drives mammary morphogenesis.
