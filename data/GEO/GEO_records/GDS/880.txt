TITLE
Visceral adiposity resulting from poor fetal nutrition

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of visceral adipose tissue of 130 day old adult male Wistars that had been subjected to poor nutrition during fetal development caused by maternal protein restriction. Results indicate that poor fetal nutrition predisposes to visceral obesity.
