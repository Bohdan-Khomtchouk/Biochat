TITLE
Radioresistant tumor response to ionizing radiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of nu61 radioresistant tumors following exposure to ionizing radiation. Nu61 tumors derived from the radiosensitive squamous cell carcinoma cell line SCC61. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of acquired tumor radioresistance.
