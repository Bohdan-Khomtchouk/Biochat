TITLE
Plakoglobin mutant heart response to endurance training

SUMMARY
Analysis of arrhythmogenic right ventricle from plakoglobin heterozygous mutants subjected to endurance training. Mutations in plakoglobin, a component of the desmosome, result in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Results identify transcriptional response induced by training.
