TITLE
Inhibitor of DNA Binding Protein 4 knockout effect on TCL1 model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: CD19+ splenic B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD19+ splenic B cells from 1 month-old TCL1 transgenics deficient in inhibitor of DNA binding protein 4 (ID4+/−TCL1-tg). ID4 transcriptional silencing is an early event in human CLL. Results provide insight into the role of ID4 in CLL pathogenesis.
