TITLE
Passive loading effect on gastrocnemius muscle of intensive care unit model: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of loaded leg gastrocnemius of females (subjected to neuromuscular blockade, mechanical ventilation) following unilateral passive mechanical loading (PML). Results provide insight into molecular basis of the beneficial effects of PML on muscle mass and function in this ICU model.
