TITLE
Diet-induced obesity model: white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of epididymal and mesenteric white adipose tissues (WAT) of mice fed a high fat diet for up to 24 weeks. Excessive fat accumulation was evident in visceral WAT depots after 4 weeks. Results provide insight into the molecular events that occur during the development of diet-induced obesity.
