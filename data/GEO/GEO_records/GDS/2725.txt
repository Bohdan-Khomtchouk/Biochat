TITLE
Conditionally immortalized astrocyte cell line response to T-antigen inactivation

SUMMARY
Analysis of conditionally immortalized astrocyte RCG-12 cells induced to undergo growth arrest and differentiation by heat inactivation of a temperature-sensitive large T-antigen. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell growth arrest and differentiation.
