TITLE
Systemic lupus erythematosus patients and yellow fever vaccine-immunized healthy donors: CD4 T+ lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and YFV-immunized healthy donors. The YFV immunization can be regarded as a real viral infection, based on clinical/serological manifestations. Results provide insight into differences in type I interferon responses in autoimmunity and viral infection.
