TITLE
p63 depletion effect

SUMMARY
Analysis of ME180 cervical carcinoma cells depleted for p63 isoforms by expression of a small hairpin RNA targeting the p63 oligomerization domain. p63 is a p53 homolog essential for stratified epithelial development. Results provide insight into the function of p63 in transcriptional regulation.
