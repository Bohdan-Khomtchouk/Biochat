TITLE
IFNβ-1a in vivo treatment effect on CIS multiple sclerosis patients: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (CIS) after 12 months of IFNβ-1a treatment. All patients exhibited a favorable response to IFN-β-1a treatment. Results provide insight into the role of endogenous IFN-β in the pathogenesis of MS.
