TITLE
VEGF-A effect on endothelial cell line: time course (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with VEGF-A for up to 6 hours in vitro.  VEGF-A is a major trigger of vasculogenesis and physiologic angiogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the vasculogenic and angiogenic activity of VEGF-A.
