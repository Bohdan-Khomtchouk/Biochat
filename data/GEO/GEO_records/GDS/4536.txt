TITLE
Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus protein K13 effect on primary effusion lymphoma-derived BCBL1 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PEL-derived BCBL1 cells expressing a K13-ER_TAM fusion construct and treated with  4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT).  KSHV-encoded latent protein vFLIP K13 promotes survival and proliferation of PEL cells. Results provide insight into K13-mediated activation of signaling pathways in PEL.
