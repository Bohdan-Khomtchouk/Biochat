TITLE
Sphingosine 1-phosphate effect on glioblastoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of glioblastoma cells treated with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a lysophospholipid involved in various cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and survival. Results provide insight into the effect of S1P on glioblastoma angiogenesis and invasion.
