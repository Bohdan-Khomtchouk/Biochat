TITLE
Male and female genital imaginal discs during early morphogenesis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of female or male genital discs dissected during early morphogenesis (L3, P6, or P20). In flies, the sex-determination hierarchy terminates in the doublesex (dsx) gene. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms downstream of dsx underlying sex-specific differentiation of genitalia.
