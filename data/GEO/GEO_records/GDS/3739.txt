TITLE
Cadmium excess effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to cadmium excess (50 uM) for up to 16 hrs. Cd, a toxic metal, is very abundant in the environment. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria stress response to Cd toxicity.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
