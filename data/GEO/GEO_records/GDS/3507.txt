TITLE
Spinal cord injury effect on the urinary bladder: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of bladders from Sprague-Dawley females for up to 25 days following spinal cord injury (SCI). Bladder wall tissue compliance increases within 2 weeks after SCI in this animal model. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the changes that the bladder undergoes after SCI.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL85 : [RG_U34A] Affymetrix Rat Genome U34 Array
