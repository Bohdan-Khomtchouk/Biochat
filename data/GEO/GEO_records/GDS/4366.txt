TITLE
Metalloprotease ADAMTS-12 deficiency effect on DSS-induced colitis: distal colon

SUMMARY
Analysis of distal colon from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated, Adamts12 knockouts. Metalloprotease ADAMTS-12 deficient mice exhibit more severe inflammation from DSS challenge compared with their wild-type littermates. Results provide insight into the role of ADAMTS-12 in inflammation.
