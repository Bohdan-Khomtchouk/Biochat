TITLE
Large airway epithelium response to cigarette smoking (HG-133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of large airway epithelial cells of phenotypically normal smokers. Lung cancer tumors exhibit neuroendocrine properties, and chronic smokers have increased numbers of neuroendocrine cells. Results provide insight into the effect of cigarette smoking on neuroendocrine cells.
