TITLE
Primary mammary epithelial cells response to heat-inactivated Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) challenged with heat-killed particles of E. coli or S. aureus for up to 24 hrs. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogen-specific disease patterns.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

CITATIONS
Günther J, Esch K, Poschadel N, Petzl W et al. Comparative kinetics of Escherichia coli- and Staphylococcus aureus-specific activation of key immune pathways in mammary epithelial cells demonstrates that S. aureus elicits a delayed response dominated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not by IL-1A or tumor necrosis factor alpha.
