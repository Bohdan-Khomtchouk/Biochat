TITLE
Macrophage response to viral infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophages from C57BL/6J males infected with Sendai virus (SeV). Macrophages avoid virus-induced death and remove virus-infected, apoptotic cells. Provides insight into the mechanism controlling the viability of macrophages in viral infections.
