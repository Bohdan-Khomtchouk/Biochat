TITLE
Mammary gland cells of different genetic predispositions for somatic cell score response to S. aureus and E. coli: time course

SUMMARY
Mammary gland epithelial cells of cows with favorable somatic cell score (SCS) QTL allele Q and unfavorable allele q after S. aureus or E.coli exposure for up to 24 hours. SCS is an indicator of milk quality and udder health. Results provide insight into molecular basis of mastitis susceptibility.
