TITLE
Intestinal tissue xenograft response to pathogen Shigella flexneri infection in vivo

SUMMARY
Analysis of human intestinal xenotransplants infected with Shigella flexneri (virulent wild-type M90T, virulent mxiE mutant, and avirulent BS176 strains). Virulent S. flexneri are highly contagious enteric pathogens. Results provide insight into the intestinal innate immune response to infection.
