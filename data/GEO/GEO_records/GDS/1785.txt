TITLE
pen3 mutant response to nonhost fungal pathogen

SUMMARY
Analysis of pen3 mutants after inoculation with barley powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis f. sp hordei (B. g. hordei). pen3 mutations allows increased epidermal cell invasion by B. g. hordei. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the lack of nonhost resistance in pen3 mutants.
