TITLE
Dichloroacetate effect on cultured lung carcinoma and glioblastoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 lung carcinoma and M059K glioblastoma cells treated with dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA shifts metabolism from glycolysis to glucose oxidation and decreases mitochondrial membrane potential in cancer cells.
