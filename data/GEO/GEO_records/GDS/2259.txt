TITLE
Dehydration effect on the supraoptic nucleus: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the supraoptic nuclei (SONs) of animals subjected to dehydration for 1 or 3 days. The antidiuretic hormone vasopressin is synthesized in the SON. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying the morphological and functional remodeling of the SON following its osmotic activation.
