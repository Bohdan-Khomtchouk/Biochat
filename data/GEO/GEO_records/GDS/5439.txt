TITLE
Mutant HLA-F-adjacent transcript 10 overexpression effect on HCT116 colon cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT116 cells expressing wildtype HLA-F-adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) or FAT10 mutants with mutations at mitotic arrest-deficient 2 (MAD2)-binding region 1 (M1), region 2 (M2), or at both regions (M12). Results assess the molecular effects of abrogating the FAT10-MAD2 interaction.
