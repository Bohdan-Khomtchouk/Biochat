TITLE
Pregnane X receptor agonist effect on the liver (RAE230A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals treated with pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN), a pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) agonist. NR1I2 is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors, and regulates the transcription of genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.
