TITLE
Myelodysplastic syndrome

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells from normal-karyotype, low-blast-count, early, low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, age-matched controls, and patients with non-MDS anemia. Results provide insight into pathogenesis of MDS and identify putative markers of MDS.
