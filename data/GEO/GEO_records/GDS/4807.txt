TITLE
IL-17C effect on keratinocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes treated with Interleukin 17C (IL-17C) for 3 and 24 hours. IL-17C is induced in epithelia by bacterial challenge and inflammatory stimuli and upregulated in psoriatic skin lesions. Results provide insight into the role of IL-17C in the innate epithelial immune response.
