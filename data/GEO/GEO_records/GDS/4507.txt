TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum thiol oxidase deficiency effect on embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of MEFs deficient in ER thiol oxidases (ERO1a, ERO1b) and PRDX4, enzymes that initiate the disulfide relay. Combined loss-of-function mutations compromise the extracellular matrix and interfere with procollagen maturation. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of these defects.
