TITLE
Amyloid Precursor Protein APP family members: adult prefrontal cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of prefrontal cortex of adult wild-type, APP knockout, APLP2 knockout, and APPsα knockin (solely expressing the secreted APPsα ectodomain) males. β-amyloid accumulation is a key trigger for Alzheimer's disease. Results provide insight into physiological functions of APP family members.
