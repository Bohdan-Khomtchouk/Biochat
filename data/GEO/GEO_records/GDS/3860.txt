TITLE
Erythropoiesis: PBMC-derived, FACS-sorted erythroid progenitors

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 discrete populations of erythroid progenitors at successive erythropoietin-dependent stages of erythropoiesis: CFU-E, Pro-E, Int-E and Late-E. Unsorted erythroid cells at each stage also examined. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying erythroblast maturation.
