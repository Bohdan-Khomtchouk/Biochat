TITLE
Follicle stimulating hormone suppression effect on the maturing testis

SUMMARY
Analysis of maturing testes from animals suppressed for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) activity from age 14 to 18 days.  FSH activity suppressed by treatment with an antibody to FSH (FSHAb). Results provide insight into the role of FSH in Sertoli and male germ cell development.
