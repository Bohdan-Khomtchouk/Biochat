TITLE
Nitrosative stress effect on activator protein 1-deficient fission yeast

SUMMARY
Analysis of activator protein 1 (Pap1)-deficient 972h- strain exposed to the nitric oxide donor compound detaNONOate. Pap1 is required to combat nitrosative stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the nitrosative stress response.
