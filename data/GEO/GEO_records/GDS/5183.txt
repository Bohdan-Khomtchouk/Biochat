TITLE
Adaptor protein ASC deficiency effect on bone marrow dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow dendritic cells of animals lacking ASC, an adaptor protein that contributes to innate immunity via the assembly of inflammasome complexes. Results provide insight into the inflammasome-independent role of ASC in regulating the antigen presenting function of dendritic cells.
