TITLE
Progeroid and revertant phenotypes in primary dermal fibroblast cell line GM00038

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts expressing progerin (the mutant lamin A associated with progeria) or elevated levels of wildtype prelamin A. Cells subsequently reverted towards normal by  farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) or ZMPSTE24 treatment. Results identify potential effector of lamin A dysfunction.
