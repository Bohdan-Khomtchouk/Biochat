TITLE
Combined effects of in utero and adult second-hand smoke exposure on adult lungs

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from 15-wk-old males exposed in utero and then as adults to second hand smoke (SHS). These animals exhibit increased airway hyperresponsiveness. Results provide insight into the role of in utero SHS exposure in potentiating subsequent adult physiological responses to SHS exposure.
