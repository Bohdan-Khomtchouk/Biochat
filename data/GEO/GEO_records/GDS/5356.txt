TITLE
RAW264.7 macrophage cell line response to murine norovirus infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of RAW264.7 macrophage cells infected with murine norovirus (MNV-1).  MNV-1 is used a model for human norovirus infection. Results provide insight into the molecular nature of the immune response to norovirus infection.
