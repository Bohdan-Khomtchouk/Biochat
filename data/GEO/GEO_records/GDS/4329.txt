TITLE
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma surgery patients: circulating tumor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC) from patients who underwent surgery for PDAC. Most cancer deaths are caused by metastases, resulting from CTCs that detach from the primary cancer and survive in distant organs. Results provide insight into molecular characterization of CTC motility in PDAC.
