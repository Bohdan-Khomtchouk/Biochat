TITLE
Heat shock stress response: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of wild type JN54 cells following heat shock treatment at 43 degrees C for 30 and 60 minutes.  Results compared to expression profile of ssa1 ssa2 double deletion mutant.  Ssa1p and Ssa2p are cytosolic molecular chaperones.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
