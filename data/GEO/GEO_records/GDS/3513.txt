TITLE
Embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Under the appropriate conditions, ex vivo ESCs can differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes via an embryoid body (EB) intermediate. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of ESC into CMs.
