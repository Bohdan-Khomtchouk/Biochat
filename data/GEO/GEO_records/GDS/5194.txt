TITLE
isp-1;ced-4 double mutation effect on young adults

SUMMARY
Analysis of isp-1;ced-4 double mutants. ced-4 mutation in the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway suppresses the longevity of electron transport chain mutant isp-1. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying lifespan expansion.

ORGANISM
