TITLE
Leukemic white blood cells and various RNA preparation protocols

SUMMARY
Analysis of RNA samples prepared from leukemic white blood cells using 3 different protocols. Samples obtained from 27 pediatric patients with various subtypes of acute leukemia. Results provide insight into the impact of RNA preparation methods on the variation in gene expression data.
