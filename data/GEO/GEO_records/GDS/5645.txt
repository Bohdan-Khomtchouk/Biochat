TITLE
v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B-mutant thyroid carcinoma tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (TPOCreER; BrafV600E) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (TPOCreER; BrafV600E; p53 -/-) tumors. BRAF and TP53 mutations co-occur often in ATCs, especially those with a precursor PTC. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PTC to ATC progression.
