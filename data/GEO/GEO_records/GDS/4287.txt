TITLE
Effect of Tet2 loss in bone marrow progenitors

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted bone marrow progenitor populations (LSK, CMP, GMP) deficient in ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2).  Tet2 loss causes increased hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and myeloid transformation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying myeloid malignancies.
