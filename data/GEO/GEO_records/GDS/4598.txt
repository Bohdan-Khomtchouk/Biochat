TITLE
Keratinocyte response to endogenous microRNA-31 inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes transfected with microR-31 (miR-31) hairpin inhibitor for 48hrs. MiR-31 is one of the most highly overexpressed miRNAs in psoriasis skin. Results provide insight into the biological role of miR-31 in keratinocytes.
