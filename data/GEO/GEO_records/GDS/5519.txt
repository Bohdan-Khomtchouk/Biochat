TITLE
5-azacytidine effect on mesenchymal progenitor cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 mesenchymal progenitor cells treated with 5-azacytidine (5AC). 5AC is a DNA methylation inhibitor and induces genomic demethylation. Results provide insight into the role of DNA demethylation on skeletal myotube maturation.
