TITLE
Age effect on livers of long-lived Snell dwarf mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from 6 and 22-month-old Snell dwarf mice which live 40% longer than wild types. Snell animals have a mutation in the Pit1 gene which prevents the development of anterior pituitary cells that produce growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and prolactin.
