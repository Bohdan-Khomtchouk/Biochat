TITLE
Glioma cell migration: comparison of fast and slow invading cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of glioma migration by comparing expression profiles of fast and slow invading C6 glial cells. Fast and slow cells separated using monolayer migration assay and by extent of migration of transplants in nude mice brains. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying glioma invasion.

ORGANISM
