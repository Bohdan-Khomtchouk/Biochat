TITLE
CD4+ lymphocyte polarization into Th1 and Th2 cells in the presence of TGFbeta: time course (HG-U95A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ lymphocyte induced to differentiate into Th1 and Th2 by treatment with IL-12 and IL-4 respectively in the presence of TGFbeta. Cells examined at various time points up to 48 hours after treatment. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating CD4+ cell polarization.
