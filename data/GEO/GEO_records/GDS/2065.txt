TITLE
MicroRNA miR164b and miR172a overexpression effect on vegetative apex

SUMMARY
Analysis of vegetative apices of transgenics overexpressing miRNA miR164b or miR172a. Most plant miRNAs have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their targets. However, targets with up to 5 mismatches exist. Results provide insight into the mechanism of target recognition by plant miRNA.
