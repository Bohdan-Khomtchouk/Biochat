TITLE
Glucose effect on steroid receptor coactivator 1 deficient-A549 lung cancer epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of highly glycolytic A549 lung cancer cells depleted for steroid receptor coactivator SRC-1 and grown in the absence of glucose. SRC-1 promotes gluconeogenesis and glycemia. Results provide insight into the role of SRC-1 in glycolytic cancer cells undergoing glucose deprivation.
