TITLE
Synergist ablation effect on young adult plantaris muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of right and left plantaris muscle from young males (5 months old) subjected to 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days of synergist ablation surgery to induce hypertrophy. Results provide insight into the molecular response of young skeletal muscle to mechanical overload induced by synergist ablation.
