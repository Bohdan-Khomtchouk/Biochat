TITLE
Carboplatin sensitive and resistant ovarian carcinoma

SUMMARY
Comparison of carboplatin sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug. Cancer cells prepared from primary cultures of ovarian papillary serous adenocarcinomas. Results identify potential markers for carboplatin responsiveness in ovarian carcinoma.
