TITLE
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells response to the neutralization of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins

SUMMARY
Analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells treated with BV6, a Smac mimetic. CLL is characterized by B-lymphocyte accumulation, which is attributed to defective cell death. Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are highly expressed in CLL cells. Smac binds to and inhibits IAP proteins.
