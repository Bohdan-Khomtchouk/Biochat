TITLE
Bone marrow microenvironment effect on imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CML cells treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib and BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Coculture with MSCs protects the CML cells from TKI-mediated cell death and depletion. Results provide insight into microenvironmental protection of CML cells from TKI treatment.
