TITLE
Spleen response to infection by Plasmodium yoelii strains N67 and N67C

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen from C57BL/6 females infected with Plasmodium yoelii strains N67 and N67C which produce different levels of disease severity. Results provide insight into host innate response pathways corresponding to strain-specific disease phenotypes.
