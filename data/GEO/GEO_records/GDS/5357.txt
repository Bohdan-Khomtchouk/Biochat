TITLE
Ethanol effect on embryonic eyes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of eyes from 24-48 hour post-fertilization embryos exposed to 1.5% ethanol. Ethanol exposure during retinal neurogenesis associated with microphthalmic defects. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol exposure-mediated developmental retinal defects.
