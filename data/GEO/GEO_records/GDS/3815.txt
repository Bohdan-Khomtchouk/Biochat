TITLE
Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Mesp1 effect on embryonic stem cells in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ESCs bearing a doxycycline(dox)-inducible, Mesp1 transgene and differentiated in the absence or presence of DKK1 (days 0-4), with or without dox (days 2-4). Results provide insight into the early and intermediate effects of transiently forced Mesp1 expression during ESC differentiation.
