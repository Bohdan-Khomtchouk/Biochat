TITLE
Interleukin 7 and FLT-3 ligand effect on EML1 HSPC line expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia TEL-AML1 fusion protein: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of TEL-AML1 oncogene-expressing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line EML1 treated with interleukin 7 (IL7) and FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) for up to 7 days. IL7 and FLT3L treatment induces B-cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of TEL-AML1 in early B-cell differentiation.
