TITLE
Glucosamine and high glucose effect on renal mesangial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of renal mesangial MES-13 cells treated with high glucose or glucosamine. Mesangial cells play an important role in the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Glucosamine and high glucose mimic the hyperglycemic and hemodynamic insults of diabetic kidney disease.
