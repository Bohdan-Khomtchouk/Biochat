TITLE
Homocysteine effect on cardiac neural crest cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured cardiac neural crest cells treated with homocysteine (HC). Elevated maternal HC increases the risk for congenital defects that result from abnormal development of the neural crest and neural tube. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of HC-induced dysmorphogenesis.
