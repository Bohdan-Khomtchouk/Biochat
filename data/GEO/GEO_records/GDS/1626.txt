TITLE
Environmental enrichment effect on hippocampus subjected to early-life seizures

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of animals that were injected with kainic acid at postnatal day (P) 20 to induce early-life seizures and then housed in an enriched environment until P30. Results provide insight into the efficacy of environmental enrichment in reversing early-life seizure-induced changes.
