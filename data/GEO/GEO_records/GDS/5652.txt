TITLE
Potassium acetate effect on Bacillus subtilis: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of B. subtilis cells cultured in a defined minimal medium at pH 6.4 in batch fermentors and treated with 25 mM potassium acetate (KAc). Results provide insight into the molecular response of food spoilage bacteria sub-lethally stressed with weak organic acids.
