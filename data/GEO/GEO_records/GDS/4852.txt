TITLE
Human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV) infection of clonal immortalized glial SVG cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of fetal glial cell line SVG-derived clones 10B1 and 5F4 following infection with JCV. Clone SVG-5F4 shows low levels of viral growth, whereas clone SVG-10B1 is highly permissive to JCV infection. Results provide insight into cell type differences in JCV host range and pathogenesis.
