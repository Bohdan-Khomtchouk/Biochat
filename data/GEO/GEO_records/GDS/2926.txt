TITLE
Megakaryocytic differentiation: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of phorbol ester-treated CHRF-288-11 megakaryoblastic cells induced to undergo megakaryocytic (Mk) differentiation and primary Mk (PriMk) cells derived from cytokine-treated CD34+ peripheral blood cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying megakaryopoiesis.
