TITLE
Caloric restriction effect on the aged heart and adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts and white adipose tissues of 28 month old male animals fed a calorie restricted diet since 4 months of age. Sustained caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan in animal models. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of CR-induced lifespan extension.
