TITLE
Alternative oxidase anti-sense silencing effect on leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves of Columbia-0 plants transformed with an anti-sense mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) construct to silence AOX. Results provide insight into the role of AOX in limiting the formation of reactive oxygen species and in the acclimation to oxidative stress.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
