TITLE
Immature dendritic cell response to Aspergillus fumigatus infection in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) infected with Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) in vitro. DCs obtained from two healthy donors. AF is a ubiquitous mold and a common cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients. Results provide insight into DC involvement in antifungal defense.
