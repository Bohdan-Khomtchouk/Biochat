TITLE
Jun kinase inhibition effect on keratinocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes at various time points up to 48 hours following treatment with the Jun kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. SP600125 is a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor specific for the three isoforms of JNK. Results identify JNK-regulated genes in epidermal keratinocytes.
