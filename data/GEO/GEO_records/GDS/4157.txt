TITLE
Dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP-based Parkinson's disease risk model: brain regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of caudate-putamen and pre-frontal cortex from transgenics, over-expressing either risk-associated synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-S variant or the protective soluble AChE-R variant, exposed to environmental risk factor MPTP. Results provide insights into the molecular basis of PD.
