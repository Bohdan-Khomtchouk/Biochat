TITLE
Adipogenesis in vitro (Mu11K-A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at various time points up to 28 days after induction of adipogenesis using a standard differentiation cocktail of methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin (MDI). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating adipogenesis.
