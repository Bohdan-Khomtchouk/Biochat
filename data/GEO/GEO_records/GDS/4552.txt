TITLE
Desiccation stress: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult females exposed to 30% (desiccated) relative humidity for up to 36 hrs. The An. gambiae malaria vector populations are observed year round but their densities are low during the dry season.  Results provide insight into molecular basis of the malaria vector's desiccation response.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
