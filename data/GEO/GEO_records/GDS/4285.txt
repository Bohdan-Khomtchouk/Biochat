TITLE
Core binding factor-acute myeloid leukemia patients: mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from untreated, CBF-AML patients representing t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) karyotypes. The CBF-AML samples exhibited differential sensitivity to treatment with ABT-737 and BV6. Results provide insight into molecular basis of sensitivity to inhibitor treatment.
