TITLE
Acute alcohol consumption effect on whole blood (alcohol group): time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood from subjects administered orange juice with ethanol.  Blood collected at Blood Alcohol Concentrations of 0%, 0.04%, 0.08%, declining 0.04% and 0.02%. These results, together with those from GDS6177, provide insight into molecular response of blood during acute ethanol exposure.
