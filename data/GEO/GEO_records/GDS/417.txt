TITLE
Disease resistance in callose synthase mutant

SUMMARY
Examination of disease resistance mechanisms in powdery mildew resistant 4 (pmr4), a mutant lacking pathogen-induced callose. Infected and uninfected pmr4-1 and wildtype plants examined. Activation of salicylic acid signal transduction pathway implied.
