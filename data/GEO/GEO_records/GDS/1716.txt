TITLE
SOD1-G93A transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: oculomotor nucleus

SUMMARY
Analysis of oculomotor motor neurons (OMNs) of SOD1-G93A transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at 6 and 10 weeks of age. ALS spares the ocular neurons suggesting they are intrinsically protected against ALS. Results instead suggest OMNs actively adapt to the ALS-inducing mutation.
