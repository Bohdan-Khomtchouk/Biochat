TITLE
Lung development

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from ICR females over a time course beginning at embryonic day 12 and continuing into adulthood, encompassing all recognized stages of lung development. These results, together with miRNA profiling results, provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying lung organogenesis.
