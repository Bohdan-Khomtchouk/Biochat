TITLE
Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine effect on the brain: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebral cortices of males for up to 48 hours after treatment with an oral, nonseizure-inducing dose of 3 or 18 mg/kg hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). RDX is a synthetic, high-impact, stable explosive. Results provide insight into the acute effects of RDX on the brain.
