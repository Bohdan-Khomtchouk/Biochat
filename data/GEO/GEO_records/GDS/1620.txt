TITLE
Abiotic stress-inducing agents effect on suspension cell cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of suspension cell cultures subjected to various abiotic stress-inducing agents. Results indicate that expression of components of the phosphorylating respiratory chain and TCA cycle remained largely constant, but that of alternative components varied in response to the various treatments.
