TITLE
Cereal crop reproductive development: multiple stages and organs (Affymetrix)

SUMMARY
Analysis of 25 finely dissected stages/organs of the reproductive process encompassing anther development, pollination-fertilization, and embryogenensis. Vegetative tissues were used as controls. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive process.
