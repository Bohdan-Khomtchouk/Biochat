TITLE
Mepenzolate bromide effect on lung: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung up to 25 hrs after a single, intratracheal administration of mepenzolate (MEP). MEP, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, decreases elastase-induced airspace enlargement. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of MEP on airspace enlargement.
