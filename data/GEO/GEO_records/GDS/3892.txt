TITLE
Induced pluripotent stem cell-based accelerated aging model

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPSCs generated from fibroblasts from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare and fatal premature aging disease. Premature aging was recapitulated by differentiation of the HGPS-iPSCs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying premature aging.
