TITLE
Tibial muscular dystrophy

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscles of tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) patients. TMD is a late onset, autosomal dominant distal myopathy of the anterior lower leg that results from titin mutations. Results provide insight into the molecular events leading from the causative mutations to the death of muscle cells.
