TITLE
MAP kinase activation effect on heart: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult hearts after induction of activated transgene mutants of Ras, MKK3, or MKK7, which are specific upstream activators of the MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK respectively. Hearts examined at various time points up to 4 weeks following each transgene induction using tamoxifen.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
