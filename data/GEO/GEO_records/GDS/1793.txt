TITLE
Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 dominant-negative form effect on trigeminal ganglion

SUMMARY
Analysis of the trigeminal ganglia of transgenics expressing a dominant-negative form of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2). HIPK2 is a downstream target of Brn-3.2, a class IV POU domain transcription factor that controls a developmental program regulating axon pathfinding.
