TITLE
Preadipocytes from anatomically separate fat depots (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated preadipocytes from abdominal subcutaneous, mesenteric, and greater omental regions. Separate fat depots differ in size, function, and contribution to pathological states. Results provide insight into the contribution of preadipocytes to this variation.
