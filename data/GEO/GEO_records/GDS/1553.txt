TITLE
Fullerene effect on vascular endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) treated with hydroxyl fullerene, a major nanomaterial. Nanomaterials are known to translocate into the circulation and may thus directly affect vascular ECs. Results provide insight into the effects of fullerenes on endothelial injury and toxicity.
