TITLE
Rheumatoid arthritic synovium response to rituximab

SUMMARY
Analysis of synovial biopsy samples from anti-TNF resistant rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 12 wks after the start of rituximab (RTX) therapy. RTX is a mAb against CD20, expressed on subsets of B cells. Results provide insight into how RTX-induced B cell depletion interferes with RA pathogenesis.
