TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 activation effect on marrow mesenchymal stem cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of U-33 marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line stably transfected with PPARg2, following treatment with PPARg agonist Rosiglitazone (Rosi). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which PPARg2 suppresses osteoblastogenesis and promotes adipogenesis in MSC.
