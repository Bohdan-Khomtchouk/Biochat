TITLE
Retinoid X receptor activation effect on stimulated RAW264.7 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of RAW 264.7 macrophages pre-treated with vitamin A derivative 9cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), then stimulated with bacterial LPS or viral mimetic polyI:C. 9cRA is a high affinity ligand for retinoid X receptor (RXR). Results provide insight into the role of RXR in host antiviral response.
