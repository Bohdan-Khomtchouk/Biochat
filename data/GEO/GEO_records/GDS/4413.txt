TITLE
Long-term pioglitazone effect on triple transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD): hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampus from 10 month-old, triple-transgenic AD females treated with the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone (PIO) for 14 weeks. TZDs exert cognitive benefits early in the AD process. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective role of PIO in AD.
