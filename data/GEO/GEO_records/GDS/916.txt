TITLE
Ewing family tumor histogenetic origin

SUMMARY
Human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 transfected with the Ewing family tumor (EFT)-specific EWS-FLI1 fusion protein to investigate the histogenetic origin of EFTs. The observed EFT-specific gene expression profile supports the concept of a neural crest and endothelial origin of EFT stem cells.
