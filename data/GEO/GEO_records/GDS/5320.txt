TITLE
Platelet-derived growth factor C transgenic model of hepatocellular carcinoma: liver stromal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver stroma from 8.8-week-old PDGF-C transgenics wherein PDGF-C is ectopically expressed in hepatocytes.  The transgenics develop progressive liver fibrosis with a high incidence of HCC. Results provide insight into PDGF-C-driven molecular changes in liver stroma contributing to HCC.
