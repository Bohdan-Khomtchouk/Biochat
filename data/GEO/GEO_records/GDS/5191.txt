TITLE
Egr-1 overexpression effect on skin fibroblasts in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts overexpressing Egr-1 for 24 and 48 hs. Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor whose expression is induced by TGF-ß. Results provide insight into gene targets of Egr-1 and are compared to results of fibroblasts overexpressing TGF-ß (GDS5192).
