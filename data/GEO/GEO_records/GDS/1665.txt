Papillary thyroid carcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors from 9 patients. PTC accounts for about 80% of all thyroid cancers. These results, together with those obtained from custom miRNA chips, indicate the involvement of several miRNAs and the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT in PTC pathogenesis.
