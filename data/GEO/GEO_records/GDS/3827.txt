TITLE
Pilocarpine model of epilepsy: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampal cells from Wistar adult males treated with pilocarpine during the course of epileptogenesis: 3 days post-status epilepticus (D3), D7, and immediately after the first spontaneous seizure (Chronic). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis.
