TITLE
Sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase deficiency effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver of animals lacking sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (S1P). In addition to the expected increase of sphingoid base phosphates, other sphingolipids are elevated in the sera and livers of S1P deficient animals. Results provide insight into the role of S1P in lipid metabolic pathways.
