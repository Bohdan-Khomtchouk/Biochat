TITLE
X-linked hypophosphatemia and low phosphate diet

SUMMARY
Examination of kidney from normal or X-linked hypophosphatemic (Hyp) 5 week old mice fed either control (1.0% P) or low phosphate diet (0.03% P) for 3 or 5 days. Results provide insight into mechanism of renal adaptation to low phosphate diet.
