TITLE
Notch1 stimulation effect on glioblastoma stem cell cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of Gb4 and Gb7 glioma cancer stem cells following forced expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) to activate the Notch1 signaling pathway. Results provide insight into a role for the Notch1 pathway in glioblastoma stem cell plasticity and angiogenic properties.
