Liver response to perinatal exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals exposed to low doses of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) from gestational day 15 to post-natal day 20. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are flame-retardant chemicals used in consumer products. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of toxicity of BDE-47.
