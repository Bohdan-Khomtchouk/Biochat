TITLE
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection of primary human dermal endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Primary human dermal endothelial cells (HDMEC) were infected with isolated Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) for 7 days. Infection of HDVECs with KSHV results in upregulation of lymphatic lineage-specific genes and downregulation of blood vascular genes.
