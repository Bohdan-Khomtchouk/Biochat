TITLE
Cerebral cortex and hypothalamus response to sleep and sleep deprivation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebral cortices (CCs) and hypothalami (HYs) of animals after various durations of sleep and sleep deprivation. The CC is a neuronal target for processes that control sleep; the HY is an important site of sleep regulatory processes. Results provide insight into the function of sleep.
