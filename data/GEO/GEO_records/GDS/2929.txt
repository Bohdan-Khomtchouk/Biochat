TITLE
Aging lungs and genetic background

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J animals at up to 26 months of age. Aging lungs of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains differ in physiology and morphometry. Results provide insight into the influence of genetic background on the variability of age-dependent changes in lung structure and function.
