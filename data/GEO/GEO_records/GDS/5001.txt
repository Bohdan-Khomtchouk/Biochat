TITLE
Allergen inhalation challenge effect on peripheral blood of asthmatic early responders and dual responders

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood collected from asthmatics immediately prior to, and two hours after, cat allergen challenge. Some asthmatics are early responders while others are dual (early plus late) responders. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying early and dual asthmatic responses.
