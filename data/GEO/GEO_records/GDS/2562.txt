TITLE
Prostate response to castration and subsequent hormone replacement

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate of animals following castration and subsequent hormone replacement with testosterone. Castration induces prostate involution, while hormone replacement induces regeneration. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating prostatic involution and regeneration.
