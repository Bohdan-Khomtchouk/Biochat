TITLE
Pregnancy-associated breast cancer: laser capture microdissected epithelia and stroma

SUMMARY
Analysis of malignant epithelia and tumor-associated stroma from patients with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC). PABCs exhibit heightened aggressiveness compared to cancers in age-matched nonpregnant (non-PABC) women. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying PABC.
