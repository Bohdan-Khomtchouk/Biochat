TITLE
Asthma model of prostaglandin E receptor EP3 effect on allergic inflammation

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung treated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor subtype EP3 agonist, ONO-AE-248 (AE-248), after ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitization and challenge. OVA induces allergic asthma. Results identify inhibitory role of PGE2-EP3 pathway in allergic inflammation and allergy-related gene expression.
