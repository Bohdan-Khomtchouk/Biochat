TITLE
Continuous passaging effect on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from various somatic cell populations (I)

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPSCs (at p10) derived from different cell types (fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells) through ectopic expression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc. Results provide insight into the effect of passaging on iPSC functionality.
