TITLE
Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from young and aged donors

SUMMARY
Comparison of dendritic cells (DCs) from young (20 to 27 years) and aged (77 to 87 years) donors. DCs are antigen-presenting cells important in initiating and regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the decline in DC function with age.
