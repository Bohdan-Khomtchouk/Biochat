TITLE
Primary epithelial cell cultures from prostate tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial cell cultures from prostate tumor explants. Results identify an epithelial-restricted transcription profile that can be integrated with tumor grade and clinical information with the aim of discriminating indolent and aggressive prostate tumors that are histologically similar.
