TITLE
Pancreatic beta cell lines overexpressing wild type MODY genes or mutant HNF1b alleles

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in pancreatic beta cell line INS-1 overexpressing the transcription factors HNF1b, HNF4a2, HNF6, or mutant forms of HNF1b, which were introduced by FRT/FLP recombination.  Dysfunction of these transcription factors cause maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
