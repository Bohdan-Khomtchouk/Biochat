TITLE
Pandemic and seasonal influenza A H1N1 infection of differentiated type I-like alveolar epithelial cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of type I-like alveolar epithelial cells infected with pandemic influenza H1N1 (pdmH1N1) or seasonal H1N1. Type I alveolar epithelial cells are a key target cell in pdmH1N1 pneumonia. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying host responses induced by H1N1 infections.
