TITLE
Heart failure progression model: non-infarcted ventricular tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-infarcted left ventricular tissues from animals at various time points up to 14 days following myocardial infarction (MI). MI induced by ligating the left coronary artery. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of heart failure.
