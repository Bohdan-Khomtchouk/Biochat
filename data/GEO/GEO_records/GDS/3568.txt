TITLE
VEGF-A effect on endothelial cell line: time course (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with VEGF-A or EGF for up to 6 hours. VEGF-A is a major trigger of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. EGF is a general growth factor. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the vasculogenic and angiogenic activity of VEGF-A.
