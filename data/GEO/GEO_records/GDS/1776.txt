TITLE
B3 domain transcription factor LEC2 induction effect on seedlings: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of 8-day-old seedlings at 1 or 4 hours following induction of the B3 domain transcription factor LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2). LEC2 induced from a 35S:LEC2-glucocorticoid receptor transgene using dexamethasone. Results provide insight into the role of LEC2 in embryogenesis.
