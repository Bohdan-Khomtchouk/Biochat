TITLE
Activated Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE)-deficient, CD8+CD28low regulatory T lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of AIRE-deficient, CD8+CD28low regulatory T (Treg) cells stimulated with allogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APC) and anti-CD3 antibody. Results provide insight into the role of AIRE in the function of regulatory T-cell populations, which are central to the prevention of immunopathology.
