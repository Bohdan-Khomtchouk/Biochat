TITLE
Transgenic Krüppel-like factor 4 induction: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of RKO colon cancer cell line treated for up to 24 hours with ponasterone A to induce expression of a full-length, transgenic Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). KLF4 is an epithelially-enriched, zinc finger transcription factor. Results provide insight into the biochemical function of KLF4.
