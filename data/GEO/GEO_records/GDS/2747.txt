Wilms' tumor protein Wt1 deficiency effect on the urogenital ridge

SUMMARY
Analysis of urogenital ridges from E11.5 embryos lacking the Wilms’ tumor protein Wt1. Wt1 is a transcription factor known to play an important role in urogenital development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Wt1 function in gonad and mesonephros development.
