TITLE
Senescent activated hepatic stellate cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) induced to senesce by treatment with a DNA-damaging agent. Upon activation in response to liver damage, HSCs proliferate and produce the extracellular matrix deposited in the fibrotic scar. Senescence of activated HSCs limits liver fibrosis.
