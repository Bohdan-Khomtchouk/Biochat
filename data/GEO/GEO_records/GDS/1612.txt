TITLE
Hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system response to dehydration

SUMMARY
Analysis of the hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system (HNS) in fluid-deprived males. The HNS components examined were hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. Results identify candidate genes of HNS activity and remodeling induced by dehydration.
