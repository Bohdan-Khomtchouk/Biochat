TITLE
Rapamycin effect on a glucorticoid-resistant T cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the glucocorticoid (GC) resistant T cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM-c1 following treatment with rapamycin for 3 or 24 hours. Results compared to a GC sensitivity expression signature. Results provide insight into the feasibility of using rapamycin to reverse GC resistance.
