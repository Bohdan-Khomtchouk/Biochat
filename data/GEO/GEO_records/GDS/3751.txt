TITLE
Clioquinol effect on yeast

SUMMARY
Analysis of wildtype BY4742 yeast cultures treated with clioquinol (CQ), a hydrophobic chelator of copper, zinc, and iron in vitro. CQ signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased amyloid-beta levels in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying CQ action.
