TITLE
Transient hyperglycemia effect on transgenic diabetic aorta: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of aorta of pIns-c-MycERTAM females treated with tamoxifen (c-Myc 'ON'; rendered transiently hypo- and then hyperglycemic) then not treated (c-Myc 'OFF'; recovery from hyperglycemia). Results provide insight into molecular effects on artery caused by short-term exposure to hyperglycemia.
