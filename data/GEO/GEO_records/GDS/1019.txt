TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to voluntary running: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of plantaris muscle following a bout of voluntary running for 12 hours.  Gene expression examined at various time points up to 24 hours following cessation of running.  Results provide insight into molecular events occuring during the early phase of adaptation to endurance training.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
