TITLE
Intramedullary nail and internal plate fixation treated diaphyseal femoral fractures: time course

SUMMARY
Comparison of healing diaphyseal femoral fractures treated with intramedullary nail fixation or with internal plate fixation. Expression profiles examined at various time points up to 6 weeks post-treatment. Results provide insight into the effect of fracture fixation technique on fracture repair.
