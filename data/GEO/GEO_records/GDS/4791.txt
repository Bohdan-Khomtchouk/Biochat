TITLE
Mitochondrial protease Clpp knockout effect on various tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain, testis, liver, and heart muscle from C57BL/6 animals deficient in mitochondrial protease Clpp. Loss of Clpp leads to infertility, hearing loss, and growth retardation. Results provide insight into the role of Clpp in growth and survival in a mammalian system.
