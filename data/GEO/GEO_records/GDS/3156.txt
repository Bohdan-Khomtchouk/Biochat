TITLE
Inherited cryptorchidism model: fetal gubernaculum

SUMMARY
Analysis of gubernaculum of cryptorchid (orl) fetuses at various gestational days up to GD20. The orl strain is at high risk for cryptorchidism, or undescended testis, one of the most common congenital anomalies in humans. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cryptorchidism.
