TITLE
Fatty liver disease induced by orotic acid: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of livers from inbred Kyotos and outbred Wistars fed a diet with 1% orotic acid to induce fatty liver disease.  Profiles examined at various time points up to 14 days. Results used together with NMR spectroscopic analysis of the liver to identify perturbed metabolic pathways.

ORGANISM
