TITLE
CD40 activation effect on CD19-positive B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood-purified CD19-positive B cells activated with CD40. CD40 is a potent activation stimulus for the induction of B cell-mediated antigen presentation and cytokine production. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying B cell activation via CD40.
