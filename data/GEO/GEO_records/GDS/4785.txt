TITLE
Steroid receptor coactivator-2 deficiency effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from C57 females lacking Steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2). SRC-2 is a mediator of steroid receptor action. Results provide insight into the role of steroid receptor coactivators in hepatic metabolism.
