TITLE
Glycerol-induced and cardiotoxin-induced models of skeletal muscle regeneration: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of 12 wk old C57BL/6J males injected with glycerol or cardiotoxin (CTX).  TA muscle was collected up to 21 days after injection. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle regeneration.
