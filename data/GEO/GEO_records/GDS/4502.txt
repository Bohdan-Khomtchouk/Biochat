TITLE
Models of Neuronal Migration Defects: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains from 4 models of human neuronal migration defects (Lis1, Dcx, Ywhae, Ndel) at 3 developmental stages. Neuronal migration defects (NMDs) are an important cause of severe epilepsy and mental retardation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the NMDs.
