TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated genes in breast cancer cell line MCF-7

SUMMARY
Identification of genes whose mRNA are translated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.  Secreted and membrane-bound proteins are preferentially translated in the ER.  Results provide insight into the association of membrane-bound proteins and breast cancer.
