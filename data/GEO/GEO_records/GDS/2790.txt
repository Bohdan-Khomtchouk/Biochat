TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to insulin infusion (HuGeneFL)

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles from non-diabetics after a 3 hour infusion of insulin. Glucose uptake by skeletal muscles in response to insulin is impaired in type 2 diabetes. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis in response to insulin.
