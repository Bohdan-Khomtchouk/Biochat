TITLE
Lymphoblastoid cell lines from CEPH/Utah families

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 15 CEPH/Utah families.  Cell lines from 3 generations examined.  Results provide insight into the heritability of gene expression traits in segregating human populations.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
