TITLE
Ileocecal epithelial cell line response to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT-8 ileocecal cells treated with Clostridium difficile toxin A or B for up to 24 hours. C. difficile, a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe, causes infections leading to pseudomembranous colitis. Results provide insight into the role of toxins A and B in C. difficile infections.
