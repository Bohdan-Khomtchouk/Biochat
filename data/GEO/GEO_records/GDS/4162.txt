TITLE
Conditional GBA1 deletion model of Type 1 Gaucher Disease: liver and spleen

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver and spleen from mice with increasing severities of the type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1) phenotype resulting from conditional glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) deletion in the hematopoietic and mesenchymal cell lineages. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of GD1 development.
