TITLE
Cdx2 and Gata3 overexpression effect on R1 embryonic stem cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells overexpressing transcription factor Cdx2 or Gata3 and cultured under trophoblast stem (TS) cell derivation conditions. Gata3-expressing Cdx2-null ES cells also examined. Results provide insight into the roles of Gata3 and Cdx2 in trophoblast development.
