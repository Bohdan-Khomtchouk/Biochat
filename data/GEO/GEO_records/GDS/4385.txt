TITLE
CD133-positive and CD133-negative colon cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD133-positive and CD133-negative colorectal cancer cells and CAFs isolated from the same stage II patient specimen. CD133+ colon cancer cells exhibit enhanced tumorigenicity over CD133- cells. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the enhanced tumorigenicity of CD133+ cells.
