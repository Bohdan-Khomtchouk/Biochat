TITLE
Wild type embryonic lens development

SUMMARY
Analysis of lens from ICR embryos at 3 key developmental stages in the transition from E10.5 lens placode invagination to E12.5 lens primary fiber cell differentiation and matched whole embryo body (WB, minus ocular tissue) controls. Results provide insight into molecular basis of lens development.
