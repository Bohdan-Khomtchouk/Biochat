TITLE
Beta-catenin deficiency model: kidney

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic (E12.5) kidneys with beta-catenin deficiency targeted to the ureteric bud cell lineage. Inactivation of beta-catenin leads to abnormal ureteric branching and causes renal aplasia or dysplasia. Results provide insight into the role of beta-catenin during ureteric morphogenesis.
