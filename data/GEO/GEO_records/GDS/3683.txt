ACE inhibitor captopril effect on atherosclerosis model: aorta

SUMMARY
Analysis of aorta from hypercholesterolemic, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-null animals treated with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  Captopril attenuates atherosclerosis. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the antiatherosclerotic effect of captopril.
