TITLE
Vier F-Box VFB triple mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 10-day-old light-grown Vier F-Box (VFB) triple mutant seedlings. F-box proteins are receptors for the plant growth hormone auxin and are involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

PLATFORM
