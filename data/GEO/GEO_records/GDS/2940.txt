TITLE
Dendritic cell response to TGF-beta1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) at various time points up to 36 hours following treatment with TGF-beta1. DCs derived from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells induced to differentiate in vitro. Results provide insight into the role of TGF-beta1 in DC development.
