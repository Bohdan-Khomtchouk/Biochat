TITLE
An in vitro primordial germ cell specification system: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Wnt3+/+ and Wnt3-/- embryonic stem cell-induced, pluripotent epiblast-like cells stimulated with cytokines (BMP4, Wnt3a, or BMP4+Wnt3a) for up to 36 hrs to induce primordial germ cells (PGCs). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which BMP4/WNT3 signaling specifies PGCs.
