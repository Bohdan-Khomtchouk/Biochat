TITLE
Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells silenced for negative regulators of T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD8 T cells that were transduced with shRNAs targeting inhibitors of T-cell function, adoptively transferred into B16 tumor-bearing mice, and purified from spleen or tumor 7 days later. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms blocking cytotoxic T cell infiltration into tumors.
