TITLE
Sickle cell plasma effect on pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to plasma from sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with sickle acute chest syndrome or from SCD patients at steady state. Results provide insight into the role of extra-erythrocytic factors in sickle cell vasoocclusion.
