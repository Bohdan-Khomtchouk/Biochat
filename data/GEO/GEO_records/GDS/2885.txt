TITLE
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes response to p38 MAPK inhibition and TGFalpha in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) treated with TGFalpha alone or in combination with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38. FLS, targets of proinflammatory cytokines, are involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Results provide insight into the role of the p38 pathway in RA pathogenesis.
