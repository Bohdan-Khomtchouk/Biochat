TITLE
Dietary palatinose effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from C57Bl/6J males fed isocaloric diets containing sucrose or palatinose. Sucrose is a high glycemic index (GI) sugar; palatinose is a low GI sugar. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the role of sucrose in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver.
