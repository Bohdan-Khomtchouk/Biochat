TITLE
Commercially prepared dry active yeast and dessicated laboratory yeast

SUMMARY
Comparison of commercially prepared dry active yeast and desiccated preparations of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strain BY4743. The yeast specimens were dried by different regimens. Results provide insight into the molecular response of yeast to water removal.
