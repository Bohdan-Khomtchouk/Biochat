TITLE
Heterochromatin protein HP-1 depletion effect on third instar larvae

SUMMARY
Analysis of male and female 3rd instar larvae following depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) using a Gal4-induced RNA interference system. Results provide insight into the function of HP1 during development and a sex-specific role.
