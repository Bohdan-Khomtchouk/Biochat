TITLE
Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus co-stimulation effect on bone-marrow derived dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DC) co-stimulated with B. bifidum and L. acidophilus. DCs are involved in the initiation of both innate and adaptive immunity by responding to environmental microorganisms. Results provide insight into the immune response in DCs elicited by this co-stimulation.
