TITLE
Ureteric bud epithelia response to non-branching and branching growth promoting factors

SUMMARY
Analysis of isolated ureteric buds (UBs) cultured in the presence of non-branching growth factor heregulin (HRG) or branching growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN). HRG and PTN purified from BSN cell conditioned medium. Results provide insight into how HRG induces non-branching growth.
