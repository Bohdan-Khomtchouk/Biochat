TITLE
Dasatinib resistant and sensitive prostatic cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of 16 prostatic cancer cell lines treated with anti-tumor agent dasatinib. The cell lines display sensitivity or resistance to dasatinib.  Results used to define a gene expression profile associated with sensitivity to dasatinib.
