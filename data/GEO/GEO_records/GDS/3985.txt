TITLE
TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling blockade effect on white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of WAT from high fat diet-fed Smad3-/- mice and anti-TGF-beta antibody-treated, diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Smad3 loss protects against DIO and diabetes. TGF-b signaling blockade protects against obesity and diabetes. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes.
