TITLE
NF-κB subunit p65 depletion effect on Ras-induced transformation model: cultured embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of p65+/+Ras and p65-/-Ras cells generated by infecting NF-κB subunit p65+/+ and p65-/- MEFs with pBabe-HRASG12V. Post-injection of the Ras cells into SCID mice, RasT tumors were removed, reconstituted in culture and examined. Results provide insight into role of NF-κB in tumorigenesis.
