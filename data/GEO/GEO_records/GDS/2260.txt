TITLE
Red light effect on the root

SUMMARY
Analysis of roots of seedlings exposed for 1hr to red light. Acting through phytochromes, red light controls many aspects of plant development. Many red-light signalling events have been identified in aerial portions of the plant. Results provide insight into red light-signalling elements in roots.
