TITLE
Polycomb group protein Ezh2 deficiency effect on lymph node T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymph node T cells lacking the polycomb group protein Ezh2. In B cells, Ezh2 is localized to the nucleus and is essential in histone H3 lysine 27 methylation. T lymphocytes also contain cytosolic Ezh2. Results provide insight into the function of Ezh2 in the T cell cytosol.
