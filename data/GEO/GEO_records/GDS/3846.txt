TITLE
Ciliopathy-based photoreceptor degeneration model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retina from PKD-2-247 (TGR) males at 1 and 3 months of age (i.e., before and after retinal vasoregression). The TGR model develops primary photoreceptor degeneration and secondary vasoregression. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying development of vasoregression.
