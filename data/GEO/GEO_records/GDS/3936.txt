TITLE
Primary erythroblast culture response to cytokine-induced increase in fetal hemoglobin

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, cultured in low-HbF (EPO alone) or high-HbF conditions (EPO, SCF, and TGFbeta-1), on days 7 (proerythroblasts) and 14 (mature erythrocytes). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine-induced increases in HbF.
