TITLE
Candoxin effect on glial cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of glial cell line Hs683 at various time points up to 48 hours following exposure to 300 nM of candoxin (CDX) snake venom. CDX is a neurotoxin that inhibits post-synaptic neuromuscular and neuronal alpha7nACh-receptors, and delays cell death in glial cells.
