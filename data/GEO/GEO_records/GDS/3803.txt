TITLE
Embryonic pharyngeal arch and embryonic heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of second heart field (SHF)-containing pharyngeal arch from E10.5 embryos and heart from E12.5 embryos. These results, together with results from P19CL6 cells induced to differentiate into a cardiac lineage, provide insight into Nkx2.5 target genes relevant specifically to the SHF.
