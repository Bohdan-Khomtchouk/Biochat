TITLE
Fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells heterozygous for CREB binding protein

SUMMARY
Analysis of HSCs sorted fromCrebbp+/− day 14 fetal livers. Crebbp+/− mice inevitably develop myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) within 9 to 12 months of age. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying deregulation of HSC in MDS/MPN.
