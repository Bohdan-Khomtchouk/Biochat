TITLE
West Nile virus infection effect on retinal pigment epithelium cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and RPE ARPE-19 cells infected with West Nile virus (WNV). WNV infection can lead to ocular pathologies such as chorioretinitis, uveitis, or optic neuritis. Results provide insight into the molecular response of RPE cells to WNV infection.
