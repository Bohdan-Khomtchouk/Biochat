TITLE
Ovarian normal surface epithelia and ovarian cancer epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of normal ovarian surface epithelia (OSE) and ovarian cancer epithelial cells (CEPIs). CEPIs were isolated by laser capture microdissection from serous papillary ovarian adenocarcinomas. Results provide insight into the role of OSE in the development of ovarian adenocarcinoma.
