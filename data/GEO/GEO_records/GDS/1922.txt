TITLE
Angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor angiogenic effect on aortic rings (RAE230A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of aortic rings treated with angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Aortic rings can generate neovessels ex vivo after angiogenic factor stimulation. Results identify transcriptional events associated with angiogenesis in VEGF and Ang-1 stimulated aortic rings.
