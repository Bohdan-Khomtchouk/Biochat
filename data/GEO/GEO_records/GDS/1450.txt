TITLE
Hypoxia effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 7 day old wild type Ler seedlings subjected to 12 hours of hypoxia under low light conditions. Total RNA and mRNA extracted from large polyribosomes  compared. Results provide insight into the role of translational regulation in the response to hypoxia.
