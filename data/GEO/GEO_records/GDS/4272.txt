TITLE
Methotrexate effect on SPARKS CHARMS juvenile idiopathic arthritis cohort: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMC from 11 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) following 6 months of methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Individual response to MTX is variable. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying response to MTX in JIA.
