TITLE
Zinc finger transcription factor ZXDC depletion effect on myeloid cell line undergoing differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 myeloid cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and depleted for the zinc finger transcription factor ZXDC.  PMA treatment induces myeloid cell differentiation. Results provide insight into the role of ZXDC in myeloid cell differentiation.
