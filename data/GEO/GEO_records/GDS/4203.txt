TITLE
Dexamethasone effect on glucocorticoid-resistant and -sensitive lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant and -sensitive derivatives of the CEM-C7H2 T-ALL cell line following 6hrs of dexamethasone treatment. GC drugs are a central component of childhood ALL therapy. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-leukemic effects of GC.
