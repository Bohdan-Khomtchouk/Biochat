TITLE
Early neuronal development: embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of atonal-expressing (atoGFP+) and atoGFP- cells from transgenic wild type and ato-mutant embryos, at 3 time points corresponding to the first 3hr of neural development. Results provide insight into how proneural factors such as ato regulate specialized neuronal differentiation pathways.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
