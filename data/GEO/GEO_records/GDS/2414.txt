TITLE
Decidual stromal cell response to trophoblast conditioned medium: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of decidualized endometrial stromal cells at various time points up to 12 hours following treatment with conditioned media from trophoblasts. Results provide insight into the paracrine signaling between the trophoblast and the decidua.
