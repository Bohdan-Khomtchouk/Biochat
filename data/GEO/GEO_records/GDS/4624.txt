TITLE
Unfolded Protein Response factor CHOP deficiency effect on Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B sciatic nerves: developmental time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of sciatic nerves from S63del/Chop-null animals from ages 5 days to 4 months. Deletion of serine 63 (P0S63del) causes demyelinating neuropathy similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B disease in humans. Results provide insight into molecular basis of myelination rescue in S63del/Chop-null nerves.
