TITLE
Insulin receptor substrate inactivation effect on brown preadipocytes

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of brown preadipocytes derived from insulin receptor substrate (IRS) knockout animals.The IRS family of insulin signaling mediators is composed of IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4. Results provide insight into the regulation of brown adipocyte differentiation.
