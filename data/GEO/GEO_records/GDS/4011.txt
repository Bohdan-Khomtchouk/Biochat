TITLE
Pancreatic islet-like cell clusters derived from T3 embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell line hES-T3 (T3ES), T3ES derived embryoid bodies, and T3ES derived pancreatic islet-like cell clusters (T3pi).  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in the development of pancreas and/or differentiation of islet cells.
