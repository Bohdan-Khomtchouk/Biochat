TITLE
Acute myeloid leukemia CD34+CD38- cell population

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+ cell fractions isolated from 5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. AML CD34+CD38- cells are enriched leukemic stem cells (LSC) that maintain the propagation of the disease. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms that maintain and characterize LSC.
