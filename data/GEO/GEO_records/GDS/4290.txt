TITLE
Small-molecule DOT1L inhibitor EPZ004777 effect on mixed lineage leukemia cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13 treated with EPZ004777, a potent inhibitor of DOT1L histone methyl transferase. EPZ004777 induces differentiation and apoptosis in MLL-rearranged cells. Results provide insight into role of DOT1L in MLL cells.
