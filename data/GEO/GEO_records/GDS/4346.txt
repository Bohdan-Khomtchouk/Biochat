TITLE
Gli transcriptional repressor Gli3T effect on epithelioid carcinoma cell line Panc-1

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelioid carcinoma Panc1 cells expressing Gli3T, a transcriptional repressor of Gli. Gli transcription factors are essential for Kras initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic epithelial transformation.
