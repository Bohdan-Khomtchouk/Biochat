TITLE
Interleukin 6 effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from C57BL6 males treated with IL-6. Cytokines such as IL-6 activate STAT3 which plays a role in glucose homeostasis by negatively regulating hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Results provide insight into STAT3 targets involved in the development of metabolic syndrome.
