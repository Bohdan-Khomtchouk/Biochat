TITLE
TGF-beta overexpression effect on the cornea

SUMMARY
Analysis of corneas from transgenics overexpressing transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). The transgenics developed corneas that were opaque, vascularized, and lacking sensory nerves. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying normal corneal development.
