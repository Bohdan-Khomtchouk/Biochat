TITLE
Host bladder urothelial response to intracellular bacterial communities

SUMMARY
Analysis of urothelial cells distal to or proximal to sites of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in infected bladders. UPEC is the primary cause of urinary tract infection in women. Results provide insight into localized urothelial responses to IBCs.
