TITLE
Histone demethylase KDM1A deficiency effect on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes up to 48hr after siRNA-mediated depletion of Histone demethylase Kdm1a. Knockdown of kdm1a in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes decreases adipogenesis. Results provide insight into the role of kdm1a in adipogenesis.
