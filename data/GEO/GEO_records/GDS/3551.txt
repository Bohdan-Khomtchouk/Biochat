TITLE
Caveolin-1 deficiency effect on hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts lacking caveolin-1 (Cav1), the primary protein component of caveolae in non-muscle cells. Cav1 deficiency leads to cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy induced by Cav1 deficiency.
