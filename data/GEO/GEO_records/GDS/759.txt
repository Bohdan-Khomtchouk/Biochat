TITLE
Pre-mRNA splicing factor mutants at restrictive temperature: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in temperature sensitive pre-mRNA splicing factor mutants prp17 null, prp17-1, and prp22-1 at various time points following a shift from the permissive temperature of 23°C to the restrictive temperature of 37°C.  Results identify substrates of Prp17p and Prp22p.
