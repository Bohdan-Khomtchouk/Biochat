TITLE
Cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary emphysema model

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of A/J animals exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for up to 6 months. A/J animals chronically exposed to CS develop pulmonary emphysema (PE). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of PE.
