TITLE
Fetal epithelial intestine-stomach boundary formation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of stomach, pylorus and duodenum from E14.5 and E16.5 embryos. In adults, distinct morphological differences separate stomach from intestinal epithelium. This discrete junction is established at E16.5. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of epithelial pyloric border formation.

ORGANISM
