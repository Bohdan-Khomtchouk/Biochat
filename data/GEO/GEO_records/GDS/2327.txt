TITLE
Transgenic T-cell receptor model of tolerant CD8+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of tolerant, naïve, and memory CD8+ T cells purified from TCRxGag transgenics. T cell tolerance to self-proteins prevents autoimmunity but impedes the response to tumor-associated antigens. Results provide insight into the feasibility of rescuing tolerant cells for tumor immunotherapy.
