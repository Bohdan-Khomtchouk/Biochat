TITLE
Maternal western diet effect on post-weaning western diet fed offspring liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver of C57BL/6J male offspring exposed prenatally to a western-style diet (rich in energy, fat, cholesterol) or a low-fat diet and then a post-weaning western diet. Results provide insight into the role of maternal western diet in the development of liver disease in offspring.
