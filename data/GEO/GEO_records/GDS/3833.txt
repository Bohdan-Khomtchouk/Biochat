TITLE
Metastatic tumor growth in gestating mice: lung and liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung and liver of 16-day pregnant and virgin NOD/SCID littermates. Enhanced metastatic tumor growth is observed in gestant mice regardless of injected tumor cell type. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying permissiveness for tumor metastasis during gestation.
