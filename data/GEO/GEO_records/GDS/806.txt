TITLE
Estrogen positive breast cancer recurrence during tamoxifen therapy: whole tissue tumor

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of estrogen positive primary breast cancer tumors from 60 patients.  Patients subsequently treated with tamoxifen for 5 years, and tumors classified according to whether cancer recurred.  Results identify gene markers of disease-free survival that include HOXB13 and IL17BR.
