TITLE
Manganese superoxide dismutase deficiency effect on hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts from C57BL/6 mutants lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). MnSOD deficiency confined to heart and muscle. Mutants developed progressive congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy. Results provide insight into the effect of excess oxidative stress on the heart.
