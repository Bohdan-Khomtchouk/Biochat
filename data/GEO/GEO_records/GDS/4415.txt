TITLE
CD-1 neuronal stem cell response to microRNA-128 mimic

SUMMARY
Analysis of E14.5 brain-derived, neuronal stem cell cultures transfected with a miR-128 mimic. miR-128, a brain-specific miRNA,  represses Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay, thereby controlling numerous transcripts in neural cells. Results provide insight into role of miR-128 in neuron differentiation.
