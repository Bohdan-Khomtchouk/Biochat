TITLE
Thymocyte response to anti-T cell receptor antibody stimulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes following engagement of T cell receptor (TCR) with anti-α-chain (aVα2) or β-chain (aVβ5) antibody. Results suggest aVα does not induce gene expression changes, whereas aVβ activates a transcriptional program that mimics positive thymic selection.
