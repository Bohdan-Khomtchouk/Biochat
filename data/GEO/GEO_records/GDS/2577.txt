TITLE
Regenerating liver and developing embryonic liver comparison

SUMMARY
Comparison of regenerating liver to developing embryonic liver. Regenerating liver examined at time points up to 72 hours after partial hepatectomy. Developing liver examined up to 16.5 days post conception (dpc). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms regulating renewal and repair.
