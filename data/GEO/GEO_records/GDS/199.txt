TITLE
Mefloquine treatment of NG108 neuroblastoma cells

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma cells NG108 exposed to a physiological dose (4400 ng/ml) of antimalarial mefloquine (Lariam), or 0.25% DMSO (control), for 2 hours. Mefloquine appears to disrupt neuronal function through disrupted calcium homeostasis and ER stress.
