TITLE
Glucocorticoid sensitive and resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples

SUMMARY
Analysis of pretreatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples that are either sensitive or resistant to glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis in vitro. Results used to search a database of expression profiles of pharmacologic treatment of cells for small molecules that reverse the resistance to GCs.
