TITLE
Fetal male and female gonadal somatic support cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of XY and XX gonadal somatic support cells (SSCs) at embryonic day 13. SSCs express gonadal sex determining (GSD) genes that initiate development of fetal testes and ovaries, and give rise to Sertoli cells in XY and granulosa cells in XX gonads. Results identify potential GSD genes.
