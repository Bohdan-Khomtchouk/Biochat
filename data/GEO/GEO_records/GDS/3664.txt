TITLE
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression effect on skeletal muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle of transgenics constitutively expressing suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3). SOCS proteins are feedback inhibitors of signaling pathways induced by stimuli such as hormones and cytokines. Results provide insight into the role of SOCS-3 in the skeletal muscle.

ORGANISM
