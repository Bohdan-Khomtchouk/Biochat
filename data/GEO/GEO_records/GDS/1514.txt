TITLE
Interferon-gamma tolerogenic effect on CD8+ dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of splenic CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs) rendered tolerogenic by interferon (IFN)-Î³, which activates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) thereby initiating immunosuppression. Results suggest the IDO-dependent tolerogenic program requires tight co-modulation of a very restricted set of genes.
