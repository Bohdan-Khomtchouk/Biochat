TITLE
Encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae strains effect on pharyngeal epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of pharyngeal epithelial cells exposed to various encapsulated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nasopharynx colonization by S. pneumoniae is mediated by adherence to the respiratory epithelium. Results provide insight into the capsule-dependent host response to pneumococcal adherence.
