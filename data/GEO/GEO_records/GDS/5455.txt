TITLE
Ribosomal S6 kinase 2 deficiency effect on TNF-α transgenic model of inflammatory arthritis: fibroblast-like synoviocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes from human tumor necrosis factor-α transgenics (hTNFtg) knocked out for ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk2). Rsk2 belongs to the p90(RSK) family of serine/threonine kinases. Results provide insight into the role of Rsk2 in TNF-induced synovial hyperplasia.
