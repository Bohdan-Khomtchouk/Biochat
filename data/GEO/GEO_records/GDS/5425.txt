TITLE
Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 deficiency effect on high-fat diet fed mice: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from diet-induced obese males depleted for monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1) via intraperitoneal injections of antisense oligonucleotide directed against Mogat1. Results provide insight into the role of Mogat1 in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
