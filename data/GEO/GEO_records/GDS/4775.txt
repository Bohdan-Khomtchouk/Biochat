TITLE
Latent gammaherpesvirus 68 infection of various organs

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen, liver, and brain from C57Bl/6 males infected intranasally with gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) or mutant MHV68 defective in the establishment of latency (ORF73.stop). Results provide insight into molecular alterations in host organs induced by latent herpesvirus infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
