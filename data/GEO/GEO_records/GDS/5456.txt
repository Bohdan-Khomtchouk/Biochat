TITLE
TGIF1-transduced MLL-AF9-transformed leukemic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9 transformed cells (MAF9) transduced with TGF-Î² induced factor 1 (TGIF1). TGIF1 is a member of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. Results provide insight into the role of TGIF1 in MAF9 cells.
