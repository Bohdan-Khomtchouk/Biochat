TITLE
Classical fear conditioning effect on amygdala and hippocampus

SUMMARY
Comparison of amygdalae and hippocampi of animals subjected to classical fear conditioning (CFC), which consists of a 3-minute exposure to the conditioning chamber, a 30-second exposure to tone, and a 2-second, 1.5-mA footshock. CFC induced greater gene expression changes in the amygdala.
