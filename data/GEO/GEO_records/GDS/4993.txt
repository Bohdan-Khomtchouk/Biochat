TITLE
Chronic simian immunodeficiency virus infection: colon, jejunum and lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon, jejunum and lung from therapy-naïve, SIV-infected males. Gut and lung mucosa are important entry portals for pathogens and provide innate immune defense against infection. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying mucosal immune response during SIV infection.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

PLATFORM
GPL3535 : [Rhesus] Affymetrix Rhesus Macaque Genome Array
