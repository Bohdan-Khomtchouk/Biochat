TITLE
High multiplicity mycobacterial infections of macrophages in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophage cell line J774A.1 infected with pathogenic mycobacteria BCG and H37Ra and non-pathogenic M. smegmatis under high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 50). Results provide insight into the molecular response of macrophage host cells to pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria.
