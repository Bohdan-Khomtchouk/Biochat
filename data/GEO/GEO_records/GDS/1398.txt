TITLE
Coritical neuron response to inhalational anesthetics

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of primary cortical neuron cultures exposed to 1 or 3% halothane or 4% isoflurane for 6 hours. Cells allowed to recover for an additional 6 hours. Results provide insight into effect of inhaled anesthetics on global gene expression.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
