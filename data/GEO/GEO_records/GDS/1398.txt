TITLE
Coritical neuron response to inhalational anesthetics

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of primary cortical neuron cultures exposed to 1 or 3% halothane or 4% isoflurane for 6 hours. Cells allowed to recover for an additional 6 hours. Results provide insight into effect of inhaled anesthetics on global gene expression.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL890 : Agilent-011868 Rat Oligo Microarray G4130A (Feature Number version)
