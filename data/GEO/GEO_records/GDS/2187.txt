TITLE
Triple-fusion reporter gene effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells stably-transduced with a triple-fusion (TF) construct consisting of fluorescence, bioluminescence, and positron emission tomography reporter genes. Results provide insight into the feasibility of using the TF construct to track cells in vivo.
