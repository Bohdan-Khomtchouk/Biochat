TITLE
Developing lung response to oxygen deficiency: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of developing lungs of animals subjected to hypoxia at 10% oxygen. Animals subjected to hypoxia at fetal day 21 or at birth for 2 or 6 hours. Results provide insight into the relationship between oxygen deficiency and gene expression in the perinatal lung.
