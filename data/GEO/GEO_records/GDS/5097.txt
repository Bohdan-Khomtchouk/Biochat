TITLE
Salmonella type III secretion effector SteA effect on epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa epithelial cells stably-transfected with a SteA-3xFLAG fusion construct. Salmonella effector SteA is a substrate for both type III secretion systems which are essential for virulence. Results provide insight into the role of SteA during infections.
