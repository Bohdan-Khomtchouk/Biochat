TITLE
Transactive response DNA-binding Protein (TDP-1) loss-of-function mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of tdp-1(ok803lf) mutants. TDP-1 loss alleviates proteotoxicity and extends life span. Results provide insight into a role for TDP-1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis and aging.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans
