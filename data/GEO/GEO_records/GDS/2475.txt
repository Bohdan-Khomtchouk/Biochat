TITLE
Anther development: time course (medium-intensity scan)

SUMMARY
Analysis of upper and lower floret anthers at six developmental stages; morphologically, the anthers proceed through the same developmental program. Each array was scanned at multiple intensities. Results reveal enhanced discovery of differentially expressed genes over the single-scan approach.
