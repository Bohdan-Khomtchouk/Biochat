TITLE
Uniparental duplication of chromosome 7 regions effect on various tissues (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of various tissues from animals bearing maternal or paternal uniparental duplications (UpDps) of chromosome 7 regions. Translocation used to produce UpDps proximal and distal to the breakpoint. Results provide insight into the extent and distribution of imprinted genes.
