TITLE
High fat diet effect on the small intestine of an obesity-prone strain

SUMMARY
Analysis of small intestines of A/J and C57BL/6J animals on a low or high fat diet. The A/J strain is resistant to obesity, C57BL/6J is prone. Results provide insight into the factors contributing to the susceptibility to obesity.
