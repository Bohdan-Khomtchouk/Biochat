TITLE
Myotube starvation model of atrophy

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of starved skeletal muscle C2C12 myotubes. Starvation induced by witholding differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum for 4 days. Results show that the expression profile of starved myotubes differs to that of whole muscle atrophy.
