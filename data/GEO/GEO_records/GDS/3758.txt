TITLE
Osteoarthritic chondrocytes: monolayer and matrix cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of monolayer cultures and Hyaff-11 scaffold cultures of chondrocytes from 3 donors suffering from osteoarthritis (OA). Results provide insight into the differentiation process of OA chondrocytes and their possible use in matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).
