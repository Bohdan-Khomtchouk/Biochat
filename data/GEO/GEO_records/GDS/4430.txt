TITLE
16p11.2 copy number variation models: various brain regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain regions of C57BL/6N:129Sv animals harboring a df/+ deletion or dp/+ duplication in the chromosomal region corresponding to 16p11.2 in humans. Recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) of human 16p11.2 are associated with a variety of developmental/neurocognitive syndromes.
