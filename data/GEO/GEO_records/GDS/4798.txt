TITLE
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha depletion effect on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells depleted for HNF4alpha, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. HNF4alpha is essential for liver function and is linked to several diseases such as diabetes and hepatitis. Results provide insight into identification of HNF4alpha target genes.
