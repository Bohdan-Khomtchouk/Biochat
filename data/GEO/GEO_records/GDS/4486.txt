TITLE
Heterozygous null CREB binding protein mutant response to environmental enrichment: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of heterozygous CREB-binding protein null (CBP) mutants following environmental enrichment (EE). EE was reported to be beneficial for a number of cognitive disorders. Results provide insight into the role of CBP in EE-induced neurogenesis and cognitive enhancement.
