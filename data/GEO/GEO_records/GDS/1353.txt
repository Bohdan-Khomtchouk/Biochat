TITLE
Glucocorticoid effect on lens epithelial cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured immortalized lens epithelial cells (LEC) 4 and 16 hours after treatment with 1 uM dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid steroid hormone. Long-term glucocorticoid use can induce cataract formation. Results identify glucocorticoid targets and short-term effects of glucocorticoid on LECs
