TITLE
RNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase PKR overexpression (Mu11K-B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in NIH3T3 overexpressing RNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (PKR) controlled by a tetracycline repressible promoter.  PKR repressed in 1 ug/ml tetracycline and overexpressed upon tetracycline removal.  PKR promotes cell survival before inducing cell death.
