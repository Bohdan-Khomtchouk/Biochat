TITLE
Cold effect on inguinal white adipose tissue: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissue (WAT) from C57/Bl6 males exposed to 4 degrees C for up to 5 weeks. The cold induces an angiogenic switch, and conversion to a more BAT-like phenotype, in WAT. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in relation to adipose tissue metabolism.
