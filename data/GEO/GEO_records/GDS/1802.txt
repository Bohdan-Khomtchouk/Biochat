TITLE
Sodium butyrate effect on colonic epithelial cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of colonic epithelial cells treated with sodium butyrate. Gene expression examined at various time points up to 24 hours following treatment. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the ability of sodium butyrate to induce cell growth arrest and differentiation.
