TITLE
Left internal mammary artery response to implantation of paclitaxel-eluting and bare-metal stents

SUMMARY
Analysis of left internal mammary artery (LIMA) fitted with either a drug-eluting stent (DES) or a bare-metal stent. DES use has led to a large reduction in restenosis rates compared with bare-metal stents. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the different clinical outcomes.
