TITLE
Mammalian heart development: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from CD1 animals at defined stages of cardiogenesis from early embryonic to adult stages. ESC stem cell line R1 was included as the starting point for development. Results provide insight into the temporal and spatial molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian heart development.
