TITLE
Nuclear factor I-A deficiency effect on brain development

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic (E18) and postnatal (P16) brains of mutants lacking the transcription/replication protein nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A). NFI-A null mutants exhibit neurological defects. Results provide insight into mechanisms regulated by NFI-A during brain development.
