TITLE
KLF14-deficient hearts during fasting

SUMMARY
Analysis of Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15)-deficient and wild-type hearts following an 18 hour overnight fast. KLF15-deficient hearts exhibit reduced fatty acid oxidation and increased glucose oxidation. Results provide insight into the role of KLF14 in cardiac lipid metabolism.
