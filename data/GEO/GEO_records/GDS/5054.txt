TITLE
Diabetes and Obesity Regulated gene gain-of-function effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps from a muscle-specific, Diabetes and Obesity Regulated gene (DOR; also named Tp53inp2) overexpression line (SKM-Tg). DOR gain of function causes a reduction in muscle mass. Results provide insight into the functional role of DOR in skeletal muscle.
