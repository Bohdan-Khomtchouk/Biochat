TITLE
Interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide treatment effect on bone marrow derived macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) treated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or both. IFN-γ and LPS stimulate BMDM production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in immune defense response. Results provide insight into regulatory factors for ROS production in BMDM.
