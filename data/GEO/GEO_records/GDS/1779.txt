TITLE
Hypoxia effect on astrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of purified primary astrocytes exposed to hypoxia for 24 hours. Gene expression in HeLa cells also examined. Astrocytes play critical roles in the proper functioning of the brain. Results provide insight into the molecular events underlying the astrocytic responses to hypoxia.
