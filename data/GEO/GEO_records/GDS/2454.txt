TITLE
Tumor-induced CD11b+ splenocyte

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD11b+ splenocytes from tumor-bearing animals. Tumor development often leads to the accumulation of CD11b+ GR-1 myeloid cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the immunosuppressive activity exhibited by tumor-induced CD11b+ splenocytes.
