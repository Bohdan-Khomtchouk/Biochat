TITLE
Chronic high-calorie diet effect on Kras-driven lung tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung tumors isolated from mice that develop KRAS-driven lung tumors. The KrasG12D mice were fed a high-calorie diet (HCD) starting 12 wk before tumor induction; tumors were collected 11 wk after tumor induction. Results provide insight into HCD effects on KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis.
