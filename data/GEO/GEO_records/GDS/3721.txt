TITLE
Pretreatment breast needle biopsies of locally advanced breast cancer

SUMMARY
Analysis of pretreatment breast cancer (BC) tumors from patients enrolled in a paclitaxel/radiation clinical trial. Patients achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) or  partial response (pPR). Results provide insight into molecular markers of pathologic response to paclitaxel/RT treatment of BC.
