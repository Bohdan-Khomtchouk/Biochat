TITLE
Alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein effect on hippocampus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of hippocampal slice cultures treated with 1 nM  alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) for 24 hours.  Hippocampi obtained from 15 day postnatal C57B6/SJL males.  Results provide insight into the neuroprotective activity of sAPPalpha.
