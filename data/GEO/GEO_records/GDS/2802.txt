TITLE
Dexamethasone effect on fetal chondrocytes in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary cultured fetal chondrocytes treated with pharmacological doses of dexamethasone (DEX) for 6 and 24 hours. DEX is a synthetic glucorticoid (GC) receptor agonist. Results provide insight into the effects of pharmacological GC on chondrocytes.
