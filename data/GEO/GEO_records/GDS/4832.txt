TITLE
Bronchial epithelial cell response to rhinovirus infection and cigarette smoke exposure

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) after rhinovirus (RV) infection, cigarette smoke extract exposure, or both. The airway epithelial cell is the primary site of RV infection. Results provide insight into the impact of cigarette smoking on the response of BECs to RV infections.
