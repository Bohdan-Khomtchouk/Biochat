TITLE
Children with complex seizures induced by iInfluenza A (H1N1)pdm09 or rotavirus gastroenteritis: peripheral whole blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole blood from pediatric seizure patients with H1N1 or rotavirus infections during acute and recovery phases. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic differences in the complex seizures induced by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or rotavirus gastroenteritis.
