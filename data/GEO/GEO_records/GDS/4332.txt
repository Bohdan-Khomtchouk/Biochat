TITLE
Interleukin 1β effect on insulinoma cell line overexpressing pancreatic duodenum homeobox 1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic duodenum homeobox 1 (Pdx1)-overexpressing, INS-1ab insulinoma cell line exposed to Interleukin 1b (IL-1β) cytokine for up to 24 hrs.   Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Pdx1-driven potentiation of beta cell sensitivity to IL-1β.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
