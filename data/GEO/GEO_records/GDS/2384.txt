TITLE
Xenograft model of prostate carcinoma progression

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer (PC) xenografts collected from male mice up to 14 days after castration. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in the growth and survival of prostate carcinoma.  Results provide insight into the role of selective adaptations of the AR pathway in PC progression.
