TITLE
Normal colonic lamina propria macrophage and dendritic cell populations

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted, steady-state colonic cells subdivided into 4 populations: 2 DC subsets and 2 MP subsets based on CD11c and F4/80 expression. DCs and MPs are important for immunological homeostasis in colon. Results provide insight into molecular characterization of colonic MP and DC populations.
