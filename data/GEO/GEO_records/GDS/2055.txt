TITLE
Skeletal muscle types (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of tibialis anterior, deltoid, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles obtained at autopsy from pediatric and geriatric subjects unaffected by neuromuscular disease. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the selective involvement of different muscles in muscular dystrophies.
