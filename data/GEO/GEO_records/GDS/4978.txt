TITLE
Transcription factor Pax5 overexpression in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428

SUMMARY
Analysis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cell line L428 stably-transfected with a mifepristone-inducible PAX5-expression system.  The L428-PAX5 cells were epigenetically modified by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine/TSA treatment. Results provide insight into the role of PAX5 in cHL.
