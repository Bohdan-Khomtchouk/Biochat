TITLE
Shiga toxin type 1 effect on myelogenous leukemia cell line THP-1

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells treated with Stx1 or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Shiga toxins (Stxs) are bacterial cytotoxins produced by enteric pathogens Shigella dysenteriae and some serotypes of E. coli. Results provide further insight into the effects of Stxs on cell function.
