TITLE
Paraquat effect on Apolipoprotein D mutants: cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebellum from Apolipoprotein D loss-of-function (ApoD-KO) or gain-of-function (hApoD-Tg) mutants treated with reactive oxidative stress (ROS) generator paraquat. ApoD protects the nervous system against OS. Results provide insight into ApoD-mediated response to OS.
