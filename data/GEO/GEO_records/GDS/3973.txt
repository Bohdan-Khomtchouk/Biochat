TITLE
Docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer cell lines resistant to docetaxel chemotherapy, DU-145R and PC-3R, which were derived from cell lines DU-145 and PC-3, respectively. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying docetaxel resistance.
