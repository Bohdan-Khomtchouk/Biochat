TITLE
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor effect on retinal explant cultures from 129 and C57BL/6 strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of damaged retinal tissues cultured for 3 days with GSK3 inhibitor (GSK3i). GSK3i treatment enhanced the proliferation of Müller glia in 129 but not in B6 retinas. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferative potential of Müller glia after retinal damage.
