TITLE
Spleen-derived leukemia/lymphoma tumor cells from FL5.12 Bfl-1DC/p53DD-injected mice

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen-derived tumor cells from FL5.12 Bfl-1DC/p53DD-injected nude mice. Ubiquitination-resistant Bfl-1DC induces massive splenomegaly when coexpressed with p53DD in nude mice. Results provide insight into the role that Bfl-1's posttranslational control plays in cancer.
