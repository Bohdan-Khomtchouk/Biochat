TITLE
Embryogenesis and early fetal development: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryos at various days of gestation up to 21 days and fetuses and fetal membranes at 27 and 28 days of gestation.   Results provide insight into the regulation of embryonic, fetal, and fetal membrane differentiation.
