TITLE
B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumors sensitive and resistant to ionizing radiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic (ALL) tumor cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) to induce DNA damage in vitro. Half of the tumors are sensitive to IR induced apoptosis. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the differences in response of B-precursor ALL to IR.
