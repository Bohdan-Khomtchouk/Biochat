TITLE
Mycophenolic acid effect on AGS gastric cancers cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of AGS cells treated with mycophenolic acid (MPA; 2ug/ml) for up to 72hr. MPA is an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent graft rejection. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the broad anticancer activities of MPA.
