TITLE
Uninephrectomy effect on OVE26 diabetic kidney

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney from 4.5 month-old OVE26 (OVE) diabetic nephropathy (DN) females following uninephrectomy of the left kidney 10 weeks prior. Uninephrectomy dramatically exacerbated DN in OVE mice. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of diabetic pathology over a short period of time.
