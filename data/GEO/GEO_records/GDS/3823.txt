TITLE
Auxin effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of seedlings treated with auxin only or auxin plus brassinazole (a brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic inhibitor). Auxin induces expression of DWARF4. The DWARF4 enzyme catalyzes the rate-determining step in BR biosynthesis. Results provide insight into the role of auxin in BR biosynthesis.
