TITLE
yox1 yhp1 double mutant across two cell cycles

SUMMARY
Analysis of yox1 yhp double mutants across two cell cycles, a length of 2 hours after synchronization with alpha factor. Results compared to those from an experiment using wild type cells (GDS2347) and provide insight into the role of Yox1 and Yhp1 in early cell cycle box-dependent transcription.

ORGANISM
