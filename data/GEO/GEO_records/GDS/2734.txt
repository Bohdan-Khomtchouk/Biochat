TITLE
DNA-associated protein Stonewall deficiency effect on ovaries

SUMMARY
Comparison of ovaries from bag of marbles (bam) mutants and stonewall (stwl) bam double mutants. Stwl is a DNA-associated protein required for germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance; Bam is a key differentiation factor. Results provide insight into the role of Stwl in maintaining germ cell identity.
