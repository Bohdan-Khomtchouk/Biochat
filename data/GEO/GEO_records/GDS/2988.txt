TITLE
Paeoniflorin effect on lymphoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 lymphoma cells at various time points up to 6 hours following treatment with paeoniflorin (PF). PF, isolated from paeony roots, causes apoptosis and is a chemical heat shock protein (HSP) inducer. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of this compound.
