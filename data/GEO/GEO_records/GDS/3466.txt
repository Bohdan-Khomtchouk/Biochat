TITLE
Gastrointestinal tract response to cytotoxic chemotherapy: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the gastrointestinal tracts of animals up to 72 hours following treatment with the chemotherapy agent irinotecan to induce gastrointestinal mucositis (GM). GM is caused by the cytotoxic effects of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of GM.
