TITLE
Transcription factor Nurr1 overexpression induced by depolarization effect on midbrain neurons in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured midbrain neurons enriched for dopaminergic neurons following Nurr1 overexpression induced by depolarization. Nurr1 is a transcription factor essential for the generation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways regulated by Nurr1.
