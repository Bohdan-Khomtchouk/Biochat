TITLE
Type 2 diabetic and insulin-resistant but normoglycemic cohorts: skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps muscle from type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients and from normoglycemic but insulin-resistant subjects with a parental family history of T2D. Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a key phenotype of T2D. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this insulin resistance.
