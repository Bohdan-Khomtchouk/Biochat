TITLE
Chondrocyte differentiation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of micromass cultures derived from limb bud mesenchymal cells and cultured for 15 days in differentiating conditions (beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid). Cultures examined every 3 days, up to day 15. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating chondrocyte differentiation.
