TITLE
Embryonic lung: branching and non-branching regions

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of distal branching and proximal non-branching regions of lung at embryonic day E11.5. During development, the proximal and distal regions of respiratory tract undergo distinct processes that give rise to conducting airways and alveoli.
