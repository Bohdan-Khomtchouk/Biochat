TITLE
Lung metastatic breast cancer cell line response to metadherin depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of LM2 breast cancer cells depleted for metadherin (MTDH), a cell surface protein in breast tumors that mediates lung metastasis. LM2 cells were grown alone or on a monolayer of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying MTDH action.
