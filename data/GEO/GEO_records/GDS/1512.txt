TITLE
Embryonal carcinoma cell line response to retinoic acid or trichostatin A

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid or trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI). Retinoic acid and HDACIs may be critical regulators of tissue homeostatis and are being tested in clinical trials for a variety of cancers.
