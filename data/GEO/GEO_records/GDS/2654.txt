TITLE
Neurological aging models: retinas and hippocampi

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas and hippocampi of SAMP8 and SAMP10 animals at 3 and 16 months of age.  SAMP8 and SAMP10 are inbred animal models of accelerated neurological senescence. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological aging.
