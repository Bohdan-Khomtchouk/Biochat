TITLE
cAMP/protein kinaseA effect on cell-cycle regulation: timecourse

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild type and Kin- S49 lymphoma cell line treated with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP), a PKA-selective cAMP analog, for 2, 6, or 24 hours. Kin- S49 cells lack protein kinase A (PKA). Results identify the global impact of cAMP/PKA on transcriptional networks, particularly the ce
