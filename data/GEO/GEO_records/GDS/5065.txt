TITLE
X-box binding protein 1 overexpression effect on adipocyte cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of F424a adipocytes overexpressing an active spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). XBP is a transcription factor involved in the unfolded protein response. Results provide insight into the function of XBP1 in adipocytes.
