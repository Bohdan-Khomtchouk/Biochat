TITLE
Positively selected H-2b T cell receptor transgenic thymocytes (MG-U74C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of positively selected T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic thymocytes from H-2b animals. T lymphocyte development involves TCR-mediated positive selection that ensures the survival of potentially useful T cells. Results provide insight into T lymphocyte development and selection.
