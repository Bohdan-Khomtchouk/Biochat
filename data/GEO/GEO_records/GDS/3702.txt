TITLE
In vitro pineal gland organ culture response to adrenergic/cAMP stimulation (Expt. C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pineal organ cultures treated with norepinephrine (NE) and cAMP.  Effects of forskolin also examined. Previous studies of night/day differentially expressed genes suggest control by NE/cAMP signaling. Results of this study expand the scope of the NE/cAMP regulatory cascade.
