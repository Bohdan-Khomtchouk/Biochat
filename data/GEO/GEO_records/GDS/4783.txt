TITLE
Liver response to a high fat diet: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of C57BL/6J animals after 10 weeks on a high fat diet (HFD). Livers were harvested every 4 hours up to Zeitgeber time 20. Circadian rhythms and cellular metabolism are intimately linked. Results provide insight into the molecular effect of HFD on the circadian clock.
