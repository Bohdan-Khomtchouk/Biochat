TITLE
Transcription factor-induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their parental somatic cells (SC) from amniotic mesodermal (AM), placental artery endothelial (PAE), uterine endometrium (UtE), and MRC sources. Results identify potential candidates for linkage between inner and outer cellular states in iPSCs.
