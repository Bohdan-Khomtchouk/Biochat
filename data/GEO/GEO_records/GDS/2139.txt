TITLE
UV irradiation effect on skin inactivated for tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the dorsal skin of animals treated with the tyrosine kinase receptor Erbb2 inhibitor AG825 and subsequently exposed to UV radiation. Skin examined 6 and 12 hours after UV irradiation. Results provide insight into the role of Erbb2 in the response to UV and in UV-induced pathologies.
