TITLE
Acute Picornavirus-induced exacerbation in asthmatic children: nasal lavage cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of paired nasal lavage samples obtained from asthmatic children during an acute Picornavirus-induced asthma exacerbation in vivo and 7-14 days later. Severe episodes can be life-threatening. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced asthma exacerbations.
