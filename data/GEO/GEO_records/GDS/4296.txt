TITLE
NCI-60 cancer cell line panel

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell lines from 9 different cancer tissue of origin types (Breast, Central Nervous System, Colon, Leukemia, Melanoma, Non-Small Cell Lung, Ovarian, Prostate, and Renal) from the NCI-60 panel. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the various cancer types.
