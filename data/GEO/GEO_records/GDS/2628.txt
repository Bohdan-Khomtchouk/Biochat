TITLE
Vitamin D effect on bronchial smooth muscle cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial muscle cells treated with 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Genetic variants in VDR are associated with asthma. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this association.
