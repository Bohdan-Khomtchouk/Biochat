TITLE
Acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) leukemia stem cells (LSC) induced either by Hoxa9/Meis1a oncogenes or MLL-AF9 oncoprotein. LSC self-renewal pathway in myeloid cells is central to AML development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying development of LSC in AML.
