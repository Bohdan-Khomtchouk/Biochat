TITLE
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid effect on SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of SKOV-3 cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA for up to 24hr. SKOV-3 is a cell line model of homologous recombination (HR)-proficient epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Results provide insight into the effect of SAHA on HR DNA repair pathway genes in HR-proficient EOCs.
