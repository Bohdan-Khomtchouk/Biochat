TITLE
Sulfur mustard effect on lungs: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from Sprague Dawley males following injection with 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg of sulfur mustard (SM) bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, a carcinogenic alkylating agent. Lungs examined at various time points up to 24 hours postinjection. Results provide insight into SM-induced lung injury.
