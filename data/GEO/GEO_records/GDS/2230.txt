TITLE
Intestinal absorptive cell model response to iron deficiency and overload

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal CaCo-2 cell line grown in medium free of iron or supplemented with hemin to mimic iron overload. Intestinal iron absorption is crucial for systemic iron homeostasis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms regulating iron metabolism.
