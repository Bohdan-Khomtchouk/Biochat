TITLE
Patched heterozygous model of medulloblastoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of granule cell precursors, pre-neoplastic cells, and tumor cells obtained from 7 day old, 6 week old, and 10 to 25 week old patched heterozygous animals, respectively. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of medulloblastoma at the early stage.
