TITLE
c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 depletion effect on livers of diet-induced obese animals

SUMMARY
Analysis of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 depleted livers of diet-induced obese (DIO) animals. The DIO animal is a model of mild obesity and insulin resistance. Results provide insight into the specific role of hepatic JNK1 in contributing to insulin resistance in DIO animals.
