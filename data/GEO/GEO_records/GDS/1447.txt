TITLE
Bronchial epithelial cell response to vanadium and zinc

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial epithelial cells after 4 hours of exposure to 50 uM vanadium (V) or zinc (Zn). Excessive V and Zn in the air can arise from the burning of heavy fuel and during welding and smelting operations, respectively. Results identify biomarkers that distinguish V from Zn exposure.
