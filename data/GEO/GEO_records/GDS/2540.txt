TITLE
Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein null mutation effect on embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of E9 mutant embryos lacking the gene for the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). ADNP deficiency results in neural tube closure defects and death at E8.5 to E9.5. Results provide insight into the role of ADNP in embryogenesis at the molecular level.
