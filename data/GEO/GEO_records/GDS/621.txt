TITLE
Extraocular and hindlimb muscle development

SUMMARY
Analysis of hindlimb and extraocular muscle (EOM) between birth and postnatal day 45. Dissecting allotype-specific regulatory mechanisms may help explain differential muscle group sensitivity to a variety of metabolic and neuromuscular diseases.
