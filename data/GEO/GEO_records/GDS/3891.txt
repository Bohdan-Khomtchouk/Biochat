TITLE
Adaptor protein p14 conditional knockout effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from 6 week-old, p14 Î”hep knockout males. The MEK1 partner (MP1)-p14 scaffolding complex, localized to late endosomes, plays a key role in regulating MAPK signaling. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms located downstream of p14 involved in propagating MAPK signaling.
