TITLE
Multipotent neural progenitor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of multipotent neural progenitor cells (NPCs) propagated by growth on media containing cystatin C and fibroblast growth factor-2. NPCs isolated from hippocampus neural stem cells. Results provide insight into the frequency of L1 element retrotransposition events in multipotent NPCs.
