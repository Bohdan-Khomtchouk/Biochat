TITLE
Polyomavirus JCV resistant glial cell line (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of SVGR2 glial cells resistant to the human polyomavirus JCV, the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. SVGR2 cells are derived from susceptible glial cells (SVG-A). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to JCV infection.
