TITLE
Diabetic OVE26 glomerulus

SUMMARY
Analysis of glomeruli isolated from kidneys of 8 week old, diabetic OVE26 males. The OVE26 type 1 mouse is a model of progressive glomerulosclerosis and decline of renal function. Results provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms linked to diabetic nephropathy in the OVE26 model.
