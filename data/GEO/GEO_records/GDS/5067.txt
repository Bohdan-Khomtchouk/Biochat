TITLE
Oligooxopiperazine effect on hypoxic alveolar adenocarcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypoxic A549 cells treated with oligooxopiperazines (OOPs) BB2-125, BB2-162, and BB2-282. OOPs are designed mimics of a key α-helical domain at the interface of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and coactivator p300. Results provide insight into the effect of OOPs on HIF signaling.
