TITLE
p38 inhibitor PD169316 effect on embryonic stem derived differentiated cells (U74 Version 2)

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells differentiated in the presence of PD169316, an inhibitor of p38 that blocks apoptosis without altering differentiation. Results identify gene families whose transcriptional regulation correlates with cell fate: differentiation with or without apoptosis.
