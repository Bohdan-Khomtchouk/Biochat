TITLE
Running effect on hippocampal subgranular zone: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of LCM samples of the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus isolated from adults subjected to running for up to 30 days. The SGZ is a major site of neurogenesis in adult brain. Running enhances SGZ proliferation. Results provide insight into the SGZ molecular environment.
