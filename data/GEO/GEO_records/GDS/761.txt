TITLE
Essential thrombocythemia expression profiling

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of malignant megakaryocytes (MK) from 6 donors with essential thrombocythemia (ET).  MK derived from bone marrow CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.  Progenitors induced to differentiate into MK by treatment with 100 ng/ml thrombopoietin.  Apoptotic pathway is impaired in ET.
