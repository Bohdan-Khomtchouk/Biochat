TITLE
TGF-beta overexpression effect on skin fibroblasts in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts overexpressing TGF-ß for 24 and 48 hrs. Results compared to fibroblasts overexpressing Egr-1 (GDS5191). Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor whose expression is induced by TGF-ß. Results examine overlapping Egr-1- and TGF-ß-regulated gene signatures.
