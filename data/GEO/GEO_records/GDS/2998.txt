TITLE
Deltamethrin and permethrin effect on the frontal cerebral cortex: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain frontal cerebral cortices of animals treated with various doses of deltamethrin or permethrin, which are neurotoxic pyrethroids used as insecticides. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying pyrethroid-induced disruption of nervous system excitability.
