TITLE
Bone marrow and muscle Side Population cell comparison

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Side Population (SP) cells from bone marrow and muscle of 4 to 5 week old C57BL/10SnJ males.  Main Population from bone marrow and muscle also examined.  Results provide insight into the similarities and differences between SP cells from different tissues.
