TITLE
BCL6 corepressor somatic mutation in acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype: Ficoll-enriched mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of mononuclear cells from normal karyotype, acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients with BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) mutation. CN-AML BCOR mutations are associated with oculo-facio-cardiodental genetic syndrome and poor outcome. Results provide insight into role of BCOR in CN-AML pathogenesis.
