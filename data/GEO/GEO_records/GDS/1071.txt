TITLE
Platelet derived growth factor effect in the presence of Src family kinase inhibitors (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and one of several Src family kinase (SFK) small molecule inhibitors. Inhibitors of SFKs, MEK1/2, and phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase used. Results provide insight into the role of SFKs in PDGF signaling.
