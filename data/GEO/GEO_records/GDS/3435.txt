TITLE
Vancomycin effect on the kidney: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys of BALB/c females treated with vancomycin (VA) for up to 400 mg/kg delivered intraperitoneally or intravenously. VA, an antibiotic treatment against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is nephrotoxic. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of VA nephrotoxicity.
