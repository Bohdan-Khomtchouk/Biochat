TITLE
Kelch-like family member 40 deficiency effect on the skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps muscles of mutants lacking kelch-like family member 40 (KLHL40). KLHL40 mutations occur in severe nemaline myopathies (NMs). NMs are congenital myopathies that can result in lethal muscle dysfunction. Results provide insight into the role of KLHL40 in the pathogenesis of NM.
