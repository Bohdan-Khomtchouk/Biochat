TITLE
Myelodysplastic syndromes: CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ cells from 55 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). MDSs are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic malignancies, characterized by blood cytopenias, ineffective hematopoiesis, and a hypercellular bone marrow. Results provide insight into the pathophysiology of MDS.
