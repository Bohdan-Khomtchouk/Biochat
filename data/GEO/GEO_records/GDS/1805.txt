TITLE
Lactating mammary gland response to diets with varying amounts of fat: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary glands from FVBs fed a diet with 8%, 16%, or 40% fat. Gene expression examined at pregnancy day 12 to lactation day 9. Results provide insight into whether multiple metabolic control points are involved in activating lipid and lactose synthesis at the onset of lactation.
