TITLE
Mixed-lineage leukemia MLL translocation subgroups in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia

SUMMARY
Analysis of mostly bone marrow cells from pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients belonging to various mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation subgroups. AML with rearrangements involving the MLL gene, located on chromosome 11q23, are associated with poor clinical outcome.
