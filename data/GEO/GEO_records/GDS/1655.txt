TITLE
Medullary thymic epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) to cortical TECs, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Aberrent expression of tissue-restricted antigens, called promiscuous gene expression (PGE), is a property of the thymic stroma. Results provide insight into the scope of PGE in the thymus.
