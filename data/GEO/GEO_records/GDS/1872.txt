TITLE
CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins C/EBP alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon induction

SUMMARY
Analysis of NIH 3T3 cells following induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha, beta, delta, or epsilon from zinc inducible expression vectors. The C/EBP family of transcription factors regulate growth and differentiation in numerous cell types. Results identify C/EBP targets.
