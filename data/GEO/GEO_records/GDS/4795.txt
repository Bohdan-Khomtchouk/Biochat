TITLE
MEKK2 and MEKK3 deficiency effect on CD26L(low)CD44(high) CD4 T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD26L(low)CD44(high) CD4(+) T cells deficient for MEKK2 and MEKK3, conserved members of the MEK kinase (MEKK) subgroup of the MAP3K superfamily. Results provide insight into the role of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in helper T cell differentiation.
