TITLE
Epigenetic modifying reagents effect on a progressive hearing loss model: whole cochlea

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochlea from 4 wk old DBA/2J males (a model of progressive hearing loss) injected for 8 wks with a combination of epigenetic modifiers l-methionine and valproic acid. Results provide insight into the effect of epigenetic modifications on the molecular mechanisms underlying hearing loss.
