TITLE
Oral ruxolinitib effect on alopecia areata patients: scalp skin

SUMMARY
Analysis of scalp skin from two alopecia areata (AA) patients treated with oral ruxolitinib for 12 weeks. AA is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease. Ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AA.
