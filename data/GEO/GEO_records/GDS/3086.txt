TITLE
Iron overload effect on cardiac and skeletal muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of cardiac and skeletal muscles of animals fed a high-iron diet to induce iron overload. The cardiac muscle is a tissue affected by iron overload. Result provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological effect of iron overload on muscle cells.
