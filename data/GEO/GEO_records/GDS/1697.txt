TITLE
DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine effect on prostate cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer cell lines after treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). Aberrant DNA methylation is an early event in the development of prostate cancer. Results identify hypermethylated genes whose expression is induced by 5-aza-dC.
