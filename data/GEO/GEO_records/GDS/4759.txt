TITLE
Embryonic primary cortical neuron response to knockdown of multiple autism candidate genes

SUMMARY
Analysis of E16 primary cortical neuron cultures transduced with shRNA constructs of austism spectrum disorder (ASD)-implicated genes (ACGs): Mecp2, Mef2a, Mef2d, Fmr1, Nlgn1, Nlgn3, Pten, and Shank3. Results provide insight into common transcriptional networks underlying autism.
