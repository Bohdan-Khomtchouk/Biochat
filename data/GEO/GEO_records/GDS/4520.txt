TITLE
Adrenocortical tumor progression model

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary adrenocortical cells transduced with oncogenic Ras and a truncated form of p53. The acquisition order of the genetic alterations results in distinct adrenocortical tumor (ACT) phenotypes. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ACT pathogenesis.
