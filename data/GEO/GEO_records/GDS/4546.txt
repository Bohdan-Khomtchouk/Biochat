TITLE
Metabolic stress effect on MCAD-deficient mutants: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase-deficient (MCAD-/-) adult males during fasting and during an LPS-induced acute phase response. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of disturbed hepatic carbohydrate management during metabolic stress in MCAD-/- mutants.
