TITLE
C-peptide effect on streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes: kidney proximal tubular cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney proximal tubular cells of streptozotocin-induced, type 1 diabetes (T1D) rats treated with C-peptide for 2 hours. Proinsulin C-peptide exerts renoprotective effects in T1D. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of C-peptide.
