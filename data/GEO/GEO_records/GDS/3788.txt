TITLE
Transcription factors YY2 and YY1 knockdown effect on HeLa cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells following shRNA knockdown of zinc-finger transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), its homolog YY2, or both YY1 and YY2. YY1 plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation, development and DNA damage responses. Results provide insight into YY2 versus YY1 target genes.
