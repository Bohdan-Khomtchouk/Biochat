TITLE
MicroRNA miR-124 expression effect on neuronal cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuroblastoma CAD cells expressing neuron-specific microRNA miR-124.  MicroRNAs have been implicated in the development of the nervous system (NS). Results provide insight into the function of miR-124 in neuronal cells.
