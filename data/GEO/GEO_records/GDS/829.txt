TITLE
Alternative pre-mRNA splicing in various tissues and cell lines (Rosetta/Merck Splicing Chip 1)

SUMMARY
Monitoring of mRNA splice variants for more than 10,000 multi-exon genes using arrays with oligonucleotide probes positioned at exon-exon junctions.  mRNA from 52 tissues and cell lines examined.  Results provide tissue distribution of splice variants and identify novel splice variants.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL543 : Rosetta (Merck) Splicing Experiment, Chip 1 of 5
