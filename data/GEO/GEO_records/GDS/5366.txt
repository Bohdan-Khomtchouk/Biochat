TITLE
Cultivated amniotic membrane expanded limbal epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of amniotic membrane-expanded limbal epithelium (AMLE) and corneal epithelium (CE). AMLE transplantation in place of donor CE significantly improves outcome in severe limbal stem cell deficiency cases. Results provide insight into molecular processes which characterize AMLE and CE tissues.
