TITLE
TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition model

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 epithelial cells treated for up to 72 hours with TGF-beta to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a developmental process that facilitates the dispersion of cells. A similar process is reactivated in cancer cells as an early event during tumor metastasis.
