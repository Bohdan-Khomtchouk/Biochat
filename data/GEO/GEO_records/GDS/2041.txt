TITLE
Type II activated macrophage

SUMMARY
Analysis of type II activated macrophages (Mphi) generated by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of IgG immune complexes. Type II activated Mphi produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of IL-12 relative to classically activated Mphi stimulated with LPS alone.
