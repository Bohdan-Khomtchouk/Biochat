TITLE
Zymosan-induced inflammation effect on peritoneal monocyte and macrophage populations: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of purified peritoneal monocyte and macrophage (Mφ) populations from the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 females up to 168 hrs after the induction of inflammation with IP administration of zymosan. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in the resolution of inflammation.
