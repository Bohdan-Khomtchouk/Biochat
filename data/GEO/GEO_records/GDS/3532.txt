TITLE
PGC-1-related coactivator depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of U2OS cells nearly completely depleted for the PGC-1-related coactivator PRC. Loss of PRC results in a severe reduction in respiratory energy production, the proliferation of structurally defective mitochondria, and a defect in cell cycle progression.
