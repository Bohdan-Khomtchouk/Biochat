TITLE
Atypical ubiquitin ligase RNF31 depletion effect on ER-alpha positive breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells depleted for RNF31. RNF31 is an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase. MCF-7 is an estrogen receptor (ER) alpha positive cell line. Results provide insight into the role of RNF31 in the ER-alpha stimulated proliferation of breast cancer cells.
