TITLE
Chronological clonal isolates from sputum or throat samples of cystic fibrosis patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of clonal isolates collected from three patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The isolates were collected between 3 months to 8 years after colonization, representing upwards of 39,000 in vivo generations. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of long-term infection of CF lung.
