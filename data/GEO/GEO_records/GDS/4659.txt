TITLE
In vitro platelet RNA transfer model

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells activated with Pam3CSK4 and co-cultured for up to 24hr with platelet-like particles (PLPs) isolated from MEG-01 megakaryoblastic cells. Results provide insight into molecular basis of intercellular transfer of platelet RNA into other vascular cells.
