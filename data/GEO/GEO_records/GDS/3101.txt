TITLE
Non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line response to cisplatin

SUMMARY
Analysis of cisplatin-resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line treated with cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. Its cytotoxic effects are likely due to the DNA damage it induces in cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the response of A549 to cisplatin insult.
