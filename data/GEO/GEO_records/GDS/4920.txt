TITLE
Electric pulse stimulation in vitro exercise model: primary myotubes

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary myotubes following electric pulse stimulation (EPS) for 24hr. The EPS conditions mimic an acute endurance exercise bout. Results provide insight into the molecular response of skeletal muscle to exercise.
