TITLE
Cockayne syndrome group B protein-null fibroblast rescue (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein-null fibroblasts rescued by expression of CSB cDNA. CS, a neurodegenerative disorder, arises mostly from CSB defects. Results provide insight into how CSB defects cause CS.
