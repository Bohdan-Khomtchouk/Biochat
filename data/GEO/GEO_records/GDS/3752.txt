TITLE
Concanavalin A-induced fulminant hepatitis model

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of liver from Balb/C males injected with concanavalin A (ConA) to induce fulminant hepatitis. ConA-induced hepatitis closely resembles human fulminant hepatitis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of fulminant hepatitis.
