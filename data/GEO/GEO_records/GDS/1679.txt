TITLE
Exhaustive endurance exercise effect on skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of vastus lateralis muscles 3 and 48 hours after a 75-minute bout of high-intensity cycling. Results identify transcriptional pathways activated in skeletal muscles recovering from endurance exercise.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL3457 : Buck Institute Human 8k cDNA microarray
