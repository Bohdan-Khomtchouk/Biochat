TITLE
S288C cell response to pterostilbene

SUMMARY
Analysis of strain S288C cells subjected to pterostilbene at the IC50 concentration (70uM) for one generation (3h). Pterostilbene, an analog of resveratrol, is a phytoalexin exhibiting potent antifungal activity. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways affected by pterostilbene.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
