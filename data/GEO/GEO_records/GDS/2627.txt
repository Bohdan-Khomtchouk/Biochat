TITLE
Chromosome 4-specific protein Painting of fourth D2 mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of first instar larvae containing a chromosome 4 specific protein POF null mutation. POF is an autosome-specific protein that regulates gene expression in chromosome 4 in its entirety. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate chromosome 4 specific gene expression.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
