TITLE
Oxidatively modified LDL effect on retinal pigment epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells following treatment with LDL or oxidatively modified LDL (ox-LDL) for 48 hours. Results provide insight into the role of ox-LDLs in the development of age-related macular degeneration.
