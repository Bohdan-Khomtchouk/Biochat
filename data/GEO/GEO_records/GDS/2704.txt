TITLE
Transcription factor CHF1/Hey2 null smooth muscle cell response to platelet-derived growth factor: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of CHF1/Hey2 null aortic smooth muscle cells treated for up to 480 minutes with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). CHF1/Hey2 is a cardiovascular transcription factor. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulated by CHF1/Hey2 in the response of smooth muscles to growth factors.
