TITLE
Hepatoma cell response to inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 hepatoma cells following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) to inhibit DNA methylation, or trichostatin A (TSA) to inhibit histone deacetylation, or both. Results identify epigentically regulated genes in hepatoma cells.
