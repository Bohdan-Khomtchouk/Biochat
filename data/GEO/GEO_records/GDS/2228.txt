TITLE
Testis stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of testes from bgcn mutants with or without Os ligand overexpression. Testes of bgcn mutants are enriched in transit amplifying cells, while those of Os overexpressing bgcn mutants are enriched in germline and somatic stem cells. Results provide insight into the regulation of stem cells.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
