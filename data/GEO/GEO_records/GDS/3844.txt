TITLE
Anopheles gambiae embryos: developmental time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryos from fertilization to 52h of development. Desiccation resistance develops 8-14h after egglaying and coincides with serosal cuticle formation. These, together with embryonic serosa results, provide insight into the molecular basis for the drought tolerance of A. gambiae embryos.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
