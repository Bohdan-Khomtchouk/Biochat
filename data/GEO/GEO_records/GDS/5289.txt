TITLE
Lung eosinophil response to allergen challenge

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung eosinophils of sensitized animals exposed intranasally to ovalbumin to induce eosinophilia. Eosinophilia, higher than normal eosinophil count, is a feature of allergic asthma. Results provide insight into the molecular response of eosinophils to allergen challenge.
