TITLE
Epidermal growth factor receptor activation effect on astrocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of astrocytes 4 or 12 hours after epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment to activate the EGF receptor (EGFR). EGFR is activated in astrocytes after various injuries to optic nerves. Results provide insight into the role of EGFR in the formation of reactive astrocytes after neural injury.

ORGANISM
