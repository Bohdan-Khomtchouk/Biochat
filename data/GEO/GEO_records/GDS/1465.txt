TITLE
IFN-gamma and host genetic background effect on Yersinia enterocolitica infected macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages from resistant C57BL/6 or susceptible BALB/c animals, with or without IFN-gamma pretreatment, infected with Yersinia enterocolitica. Results provide insight into the impact of host genetic background and IFN-gamma on Y. enterocolitica infections.
