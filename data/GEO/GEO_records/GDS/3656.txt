TITLE
Folic acid effect on endothelial progenitor cells of type 1 diabetes patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) before and 4 weeks of dietary folic acid (FA) supplementation. EPCs are involved in vascular wall repair. T1D results in reduced circulating EPCs. Results provide insight into the effect of FA on EPC function.
