TITLE
LEAFY transcription factor targets

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in 9 day old LEAFY-GR, 35S::LFY or Landsberg erecta seedlings treated with dexamethasone and/or cycloheximide identifies LFY targets which likely initiate changes required for vegetative to reproductive switch.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
