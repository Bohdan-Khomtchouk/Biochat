TITLE
Zaire ebolavirus infection of macrophage: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary macrophages from three donors (D1, D2, D3) up to 6 hrs after in vitro exposure to purified Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) virions. ZEBOV is the etiological agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF). Results provide insight into the initial response of macrophages exposed to Ebola virions.
