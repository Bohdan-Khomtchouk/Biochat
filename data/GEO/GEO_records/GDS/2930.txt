TITLE
Cis-urocanic acid effect on keratinocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes treated with cis-urocanic acid (UCA). UCA is an epidermal chromophore that undergoes trans to cis photoisomerization following ultraviolet radiation exposure. Results provide insight into the effect of cis-UCA on the cell-mediated immune response in the skin.
