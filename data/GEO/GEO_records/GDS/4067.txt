TITLE
Metastatic hybrid cell line of estrogen receptor-negative and -positive breast cancer cells in mouse bone marrow

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen-independent, metastatic hybrid cell line B6TC generated by aggressive, ER-negative (MDA231) and less aggressive, ER-positive (ZR75) breast cancer cells in mouse bone marrow. Results provide insight into the contribution of breast tumor heterogeneity to its progression.
