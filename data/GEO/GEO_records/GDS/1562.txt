TITLE
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of 14 tumor biopsies from children affected by alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). Seven patients were positive for the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene, which indicates an unfavorable prognosis. Results identify expression signatures that differentiate PAX3-FKHR positive from PAX3-FKHR negative ARMS.
