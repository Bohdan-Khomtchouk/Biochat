TITLE
Ventilator-induced lung injury (rat)

SUMMARY
Investigation of deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation (MV) on lung gene expression in model of ventilator-induced lung injury. MV, a treatment of acute lung injury, can augment injury in some patients.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
