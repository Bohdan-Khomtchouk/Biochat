TITLE
UTP and alpha-chemokine CXCL12 effect on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) treated with UTP, alpha-chemokine CXCL12, or both. CXCL12 is a HSC chemoattractant secreted by the bone marrow. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of CXCL12-dependent HSC migration by UTP.
