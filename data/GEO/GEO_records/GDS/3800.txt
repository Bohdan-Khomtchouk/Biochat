TITLE
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein deficiency effect on pancreatic islet cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islet cells deficient for the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein from 18 to 26 wk-old animals.  Loss of Vhlh in beta-cells leads to impaired glucose tolerance and to abnormal insulin secretion. Results provide insight into the role of Vhlh in pancreatic beta cells.
