TITLE
Aging effect on hippocampal regions critical for memory and cognition

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampal cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus from young and aged female simians. Aging rhesus monkeys develop Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) symptoms and age-related cognitive decline similar to humans. Results provide insight into MetS-associated brain dysfunction in aging.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

PLATFORM
