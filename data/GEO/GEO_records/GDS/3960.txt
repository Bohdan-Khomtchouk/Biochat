TITLE
Preimplantation embryonic development (Bovine)

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryos at different stages of preimplantation embryonic development (PED): oocyte, one-cell, two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell, 16-cell, morula, and blastocyst. The progression of PED is highly conserved among mammals. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying PED.
