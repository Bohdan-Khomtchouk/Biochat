TITLE
IFN-gamma and IL-1beta effect on thyroid epithelial cells (HG-U133A 2.0)

SUMMARY
Analysis of thyroid epithelial cells (TECs) treated with IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, or both. Fas-mediated apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases. TECs are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, but the resistance is overcome by pretreatment with IFN-gamma and IL-1beta.
