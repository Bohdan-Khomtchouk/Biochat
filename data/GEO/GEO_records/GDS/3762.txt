TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to unloading and subsequent reloading

SUMMARY
Analysis of left vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from 7 sedentary men following unloading (48 hr) via unilateral lower limb suspensionand and subsequent reloading (24 hr). Results provide insight into molecular events underlying the earliest stages of skeletal muscle disuse and reambulation.
