TITLE
NF-E2-related factor 2 Nrf2 activation effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers with hepatocyte-specific Keap1 deficiency. Keap1 represses transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Amplification of Nrf2 signaling inhibits acute inflammatory liver injury.  Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Nrf2-dependent cytoprotection.
