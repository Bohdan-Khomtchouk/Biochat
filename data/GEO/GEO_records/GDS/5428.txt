TITLE
CD40 activation effect on DBC1-deficient splenic B cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of DBC1-knockout splenic B cells following anti-CD40 activation. The deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) gene was initially identified as part of the 8p22 chromosome region that is deleted in breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of DBC1 in B cell function.
