TITLE
Simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis model of HIV-associated dementia: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampus from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encephalitis and control monkeys. Rhesus SIV encephalitis closely models human HIV-associated dementia (HAD) occurring in patients with advanced HIV. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying HAD cognitive deficits.
