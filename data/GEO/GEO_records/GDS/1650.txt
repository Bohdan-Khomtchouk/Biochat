TITLE
Pulmonary adenocarcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of pulmonary adenocarcinomas (AC). Carcinogen exposure is responsible for the majority of ACs. Results compared with those obtained from a urethane-induced lung tumor model in the mouse (GDS1649), and provide insight into the conserved pathways underlying the development of AC.
