TITLE
ERG transcription factor depletion effect on endothelial cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial HUVEC cells depleted for the ETS-related gene (ERG) product.  ERG is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. Results provide insight into the role of ERG in the regulation of normal endothelial cell function.
