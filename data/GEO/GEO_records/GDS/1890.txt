TITLE
Hoxc13 overexpression effect on the skin

SUMMARY
Analysis of skins of post-natal day 5 transgenics overexpressing the homeobox (Hox) gene Hoxc13. Hox genes are implicated in hair follicle differentiation, and Hoxc13 overexpression in transgenics leads to hair shaft defects, alopecia, and epidermal abnormalities.
