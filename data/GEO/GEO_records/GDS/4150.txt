TITLE
Identical twins discordant for Multiple sclerosis: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes sorted from PBMCs from 4 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for relapsing remitting Multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The affected twin was free of disease-modifying therapies. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the etiopathogenesis of RRMS.
