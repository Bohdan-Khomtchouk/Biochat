TITLE
Beta-catenin depletion effect on pancreatic cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of AsPc1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells depleted for beta-catenin. Dysregulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers. Results compared to those from AsPC1 cells treated with the CREB-binding protein inhibitor ICG-001 (GDS5323).
