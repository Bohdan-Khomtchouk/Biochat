TITLE
Oligodendroglial cell model of multiple system atrophy: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of oligodendroglia stably expressing α-synuclein and transiently expressing p25α for up to 16 hrs. Coexpression of α -synuclein and p25α causes a degenerative phenotype modeling multiple system atrophy (MSA). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of MSA pathogenesis.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
