TITLE
Quiescent stb3 null mutant response to glucose

SUMMARY
Analysis of the response of quiescent stb3 null cells to glucose. STB3 encodes a protein that binds to the Ribosomal RNA Processing Element, a DNA sequence motif that regulates genes needed for growth. Results provide insight into Stb3â€™s role during the transition from quiescence to rapid growth.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
