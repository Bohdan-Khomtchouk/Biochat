TITLE
Folate deficiency and arsenic effect on the skin

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin from transgenic K6/ODC animals maintained on a folate deficient diet and exposed to 1 or 10 ppm sodium arsenate. K6/ODC mice develop skin tumors when exposed to sodium arsenite. Results provide insight into the combined effect of folate deficiency and arsenic on the skin.
