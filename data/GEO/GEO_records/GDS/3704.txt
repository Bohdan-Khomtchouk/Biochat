Dietary polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals before and 6 hours after the consumption of shakes containing either mainly polyunsanturated (PUFA) or saturated fatty acids (SFA). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the beneficial effect of PUFA on health.
