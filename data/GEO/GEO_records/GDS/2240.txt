TITLE
Ileocecal epithelial cell line response to Cryptosporidium parvum infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT-8 ileocecal epithelial cells at various time points up to 72 hours after infection with Cryptosporidium parvum, an obligate intracellular protozoan that is a major cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Results provide insight into the interaction between the host cell and C. parvum.
