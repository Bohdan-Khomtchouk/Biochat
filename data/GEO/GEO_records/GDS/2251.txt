TITLE
Myeloid leukemia cell lines

SUMMARY
Comparison of myeloid leukemia cells to normal monocytes. Transcriptional status of each gene compared to its CpG methylation state. The methylation of CpG islands is associated with transcriptional repression and, in cancer, leads to the abnormal silencing of tumor suppressor genes.
