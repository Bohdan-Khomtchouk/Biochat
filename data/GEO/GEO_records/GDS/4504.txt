TITLE
Dicer1 deletion effect on bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitors

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow-derived GMPs from Dicer1-deficient, C57BL/6 females. Dicer1 encodes an RNaseIII enzyme critical for miRNA biogenesis. Dicer1-deficient GMPs are defective in myeloid development in vitro. Results provide insight into the role of miRNAs in myeloid-lineage specification.
