TITLE
Hair follicle and skin molecular signatures

SUMMARY
Comparison of hair follicle matrix, outer root sheath, dermal papilla cells, melanocytes, and a dermal fraction enriched in fibroblasts were FACS-isolated from 4 day old Lef1-RFP/K14-H2BGFP backskins. Contributes to molecular dissection of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in the hair follicle.
