TITLE
Transforming growth factor, beta receptor II knockout effect on embryonic posterior palate

SUMMARY
Analysis of posterior portions of the palate from E15.5 embryos with an epithelial cell-specific conditional inactivation of Transforming growth factor, beta receptor II (Tgfbr2). Results, together with those from GDS4921, provide insight into the role of TGFÎ² signaling in soft palate development.
