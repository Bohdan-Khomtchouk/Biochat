TITLE
Pristane-induced plasmacytoma tumor model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mesentery from BALB/c, DBA, and BALB/DBA animals up to 18 days after intraperitoneal injection of pristane (TMPD). TMPD induces B-cell plasmacytoma (PCT) in 60% of BALB/c animals, but DBA animals remain tumor-free. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PCT susceptibility.
