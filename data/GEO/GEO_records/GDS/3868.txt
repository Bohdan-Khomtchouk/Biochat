TITLE
Elevated laminar shear stress effect on umbilical endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HUVECs cultured for 24 h at a normal laminar shear stress (LSS15) or elevated shear stress (LSS75). LSS is a key regulator of endothelial function that underlies protection or predilection for atherogenesis. Results provide insight into the effect of increased LSS on the endothelium.
