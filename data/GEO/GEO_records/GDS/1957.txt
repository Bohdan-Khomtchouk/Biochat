TITLE
Interferon gamma effect on suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 deficient livers: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of interferon gamma (IFNg) on the livers of animals lacking IFNg, or both suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and IFNg. Gene expression examined up to 48 hours following IFNg treatment. Results provide insight into the role of SOCS1 in regulating the response to IFNg.
