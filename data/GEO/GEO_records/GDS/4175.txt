TITLE
Imatinib effect on Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ph+ ALL cell lines (BV-173, NALM-1, SUP-B15, and TOM1) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. Ph encodes oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, which defines a subset of ALL with an unfavorable prognosis. Results provide insight into TKI resistance mechanisms in Ph+ ALL.
