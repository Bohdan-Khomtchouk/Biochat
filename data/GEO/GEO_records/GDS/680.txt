TITLE
Oxygen deprivation expression profiling of various mutants

SUMMARY
Examination of K-12 MG1655 deletion strains grown in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.  Strains deleted for transcriptional regulators in oxygen response.  Results used to validate a computational model of transcriptional and metabolic networks.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12
