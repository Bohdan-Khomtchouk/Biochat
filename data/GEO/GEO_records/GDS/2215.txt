TITLE
Insecticides chlorpyrifos and cyfluthrin effect on primary fetal astrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary fetal astrocytes following exposure to the insecticide chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate, or cyfluthrin, a pyrethroid. Results provide insight into the neurotoxicity of cyfluthrin compared to chlorpyrifos and the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of both insecticides.
