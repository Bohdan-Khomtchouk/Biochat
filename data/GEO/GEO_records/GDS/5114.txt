TITLE
Wild type, postnatal day 7 motor neuron populations

SUMMARY
Analysis of dorsolateral nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, and lumbar motor neurons isolated from wild-type, P7 males. In ALS, lumbar motor neurons are vulnerable to neurodegeneration.  Results provide insight into the molecular characteristics contributing to selective neurodegeneration.

ORGANISM
