TITLE
Zinc metalloproteinase Zmpste24 deficiency effect on embryonic fibroblasts in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured, early passage (P3) embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Zmpste24. ZMPSTE24-null mutants have a short lifespan and show some signs of accelerated ageing. Results provide insight into the role of Zmpste24 in the aging process.
