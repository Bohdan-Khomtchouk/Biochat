TITLE
Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate effect on prepubertal testes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of testes of postnatal day 28 animals at various time points up to 12 hrs after acute exposure to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Phthalate plasticizers can damage fetal and prepubertal testis.   Results provide insight into mechanisms of prepubertal phthalate-induced testicular injury.
