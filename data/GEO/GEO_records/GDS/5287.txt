TITLE
SMRT depleted breast cancer cell line response to estradiol: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ER-alpha+ MCF7 breast cancer cells depleted for the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT). SMRT depleted cells examined 4 and 24 hours following treatment with estradiol. Results provide insight into the role of SMRT in breast cancer progression.
