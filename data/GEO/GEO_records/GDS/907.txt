TITLE
Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha disruption effect on olfactory epithelium

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of the olfactory epithelium (OE) from macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha disrupted (Mip-1alpha-/-) 6 week old C57BL/6 males. Effect of injecting wild type Mip-1alpha into the OE of Mip-1alpha-/- males examined. Results provide insight into OE remodeling.
