TITLE
Msn2/4 role in metabolic remodeling during short-term anaerobiosis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of catabolite-derepressed (galactose) wildtype JM43 and isogenic msn2/4 mutant KKY8 cells shifted to short-term anaerobiosis (2 generations). Msn2 and 4 are key stress factors. Results suggest Msn2/4 involvement in metabolic remodeling during acclimatization to short-term anaerobiosis.
