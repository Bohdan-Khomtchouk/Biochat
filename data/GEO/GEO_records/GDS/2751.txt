TITLE
Pocket protein ortholog lin-35 null mutant at various stages of development

SUMMARY
Analysis of lin-35 null mutants at the embryonic stage, and L1 and L4 larval stages. LIN-35 is an ortholog of the mammalian pocket protein family members, pRb, p107, and p130. Results provide insight into the role of pocket proteins in development.

ORGANISM
