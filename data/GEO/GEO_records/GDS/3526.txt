TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to myostatin inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles of 4 to 5 month old males treated with an anti-myostatin antibody to inhibit myostatin activity. Myostatin null mutations lead to hypermuscularity. Results provide insight into the molecular effect of the post-developmental loss of myostatin activity on skeletal muscles.
