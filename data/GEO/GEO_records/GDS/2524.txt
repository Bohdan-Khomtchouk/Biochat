TITLE
Effect of gonadal steroids on sex differences in response to blood-stage malaria infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) isolated from spleens of intact and gonadectomized (gdx) males and females up to 14 days after inoculation with Plasmodium chabaudi. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms mediating the sexual dimorphism in resistance to blood-stage malaria infection.
