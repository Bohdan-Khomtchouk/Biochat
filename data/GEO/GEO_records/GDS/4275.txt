TITLE
Pituitary gonadotrope tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonadotrope/null cell tumors and normal pituitaries from autopsy samples. Pituitary gonadotrope tumors cause significant morbidity, hormonal deficits, and are more common in men. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression.
