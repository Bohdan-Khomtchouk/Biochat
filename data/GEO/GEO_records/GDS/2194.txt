TITLE
Lung response to cigarette smoke: dose response (RAE230A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of animals exposed to 300 or 600 ug total particulate matter (TPM)/l of cigarette smoke (CS) for 13 weeks and allowed to recover 2, 6, or 20 hours after the last exposure. Results provide insight into mechanisms involved in the onset and development of CS-related diseases.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL341 : [RAE230A] Affymetrix Rat Expression 230A Array
