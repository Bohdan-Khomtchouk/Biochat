TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of uterine tissues of decidualized animals for up to 84 hours after the withdrawal of progesterone to induce a process similar to menstruation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the remodeling and breakdown of the endometrium during the menstrual cycle.
