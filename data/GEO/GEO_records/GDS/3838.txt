TITLE
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adjacent normal tissue from patients in China. Genomic instability plays an important role in ESCC. Gene expression results, together with DNA copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNNLOH) status, provide insight into ESCC development.
