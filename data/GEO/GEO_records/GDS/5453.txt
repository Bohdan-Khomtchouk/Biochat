TITLE
GRHL3-depleted epidermal keratinocyte response to the induction of differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of Grainyhead like 3 (GRHL3)-depleted neonatal epidermal keratinocytes following treatment with 1.8 mM calcium for 24 hours to induce differentiation. GRHL3 encodes a transcription factor. Results provide insight into the role of GRHL3 in keratinocyte differentiation.
