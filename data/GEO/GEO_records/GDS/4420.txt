TITLE
Stem cell factor effect on bone marrow-derived mast cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow-derived mast cells (MC) treated with interleukin 3 (IL3) or IL3 + stem cell factor (SCF). MCs chronically exposed to SCF have a greatly reduced capacity to degranulate and to generate cytokines in response to antigen. Results provide insight into role of SCF in MC activation.
