TITLE
COP1 depletion effect on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of Huh7, HepG2, and Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells depleted for the ubiquitin modulator COP1. COP1 regulates p53 activity by ubiquitination. p53 is wild type in HepG2, mutated in Huh7, and lacking in Hep3B. Results provide insight into the role of COP1 in HCC pathogenesis.
