TITLE
Neuro2a neuroblastoma cell lines: anchorage dependent cells and anchorage independent tumorspheres

SUMMARY
Analysis of two reversible phenotypes of neuroblastoma Neuro2a: proliferative anchorage dependent (AD) cells and slow growing anoikis-resistant anchorage independent (AI) cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying reversible phenotypic transition in neuroblastoma.
