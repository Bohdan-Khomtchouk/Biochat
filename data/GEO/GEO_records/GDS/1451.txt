TITLE
Toxicants effect on liver: pooled and individual sample comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of Sprague-Dawley males at various time points up to 168 hours after treatment with clofibrate, diethylhexylphthalate, or valproic acid. Expression profiles from pooled and individual samples compared. Results provide insight into the impact of pooling on experimental analysis.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
