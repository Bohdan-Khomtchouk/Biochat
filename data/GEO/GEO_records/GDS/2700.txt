TITLE
Intestinal polyposis model

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal polyps generated by the deletion of the phosphatase PTEN gene from the intestine. Intestinal polyposis results from an abnormal increase in the number of crypts, which contain stem cells. Results provide insight into the relationship between stem cells and polyp formation.
