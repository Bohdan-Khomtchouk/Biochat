TITLE
Wilms' tumor suppressor (WT1) targets: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of U2OS osteosarcoma cells at various time points up to 12 hours following induction of a tetracycline-repressible Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene encoding the -KTS isoform. WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is involved in organ development.
