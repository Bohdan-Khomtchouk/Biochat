TITLE
Rod-derived cone viability factor deficiency effect on the retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas from animals lacking the rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF). RdCVF is encoded by the Nxnl1 gene. Cone loss in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa is reduced by RdCVF protein therapy. Results provide insight into the physiological role of RdCVF in the retina.
