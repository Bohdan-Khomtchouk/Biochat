TITLE
Myod and Myog expression effect on myogenesis: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of embryonic Myf-5/Myod null fibroblasts tranduced with a Myod-estrogen receptor hormone binding domain fusion protein alone or in combination with a constitutively expressed Myog. Results provide insight into the roles of Myod and Myog in muscle differentiation.
