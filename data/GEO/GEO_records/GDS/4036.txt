TITLE
Rosiglitazone effect on streptozotocin-induced diabetic DBA/2J mice: perpheral sciatic nerve

SUMMARY
Analysis of sciatic nerve of STZ-induced diabetic DBA/2J mice treated with Rosi, a potent insulin sensitizer. Diabetic DBA/2J mice developed severe hyperglycemia, diabetic neuropathy (DN), and elevated oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the effect of Rosi treatment on DN development.
