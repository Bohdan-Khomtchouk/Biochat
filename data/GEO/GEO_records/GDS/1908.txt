TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide response: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of oxyR deletion mutant and wild type cells following treatment with 1 mM hydrogen peroxide. OxyR is a transcription factor that senses oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the mechanisms involved in oxidative stress tolerance.

ORGANISM
