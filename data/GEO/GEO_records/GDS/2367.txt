TITLE
Tamoxifen effect on breast cancer cell line expressing estrogen receptor alpha and beta

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer (BC) cells infected with adenovirus-ERbeta and treated with tamoxifen (Tam). Tam is a selective ER modulator used in BC prevention and treatment. Results provide insight into Tam activity in the presence of both ERs.
