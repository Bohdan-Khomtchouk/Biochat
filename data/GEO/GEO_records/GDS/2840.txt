TITLE
DNA electroporation effect on skeletal muscles: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of tibialis cranialis muscles at various time points up to 3 weeks following transfection with green fluorescent protein (GFP) using DNA electroporation. Results provide insight into the feasibility of introducing the DNA electrotransfer to muscle for clinical use.
