TITLE
Spatial and temporal development of mammalian salivary glands

SUMMARY
Analysis of highly localized regions of salivary gland epithelia from 12.5-, 13.5-, 14-, and 15-day-old ICR embryos. Development of mouse submandibular salivary gland begins at E11.5. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying salivary gland development and differentiation.

ORGANISM
