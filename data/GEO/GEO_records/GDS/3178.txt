SUMMARY
Analysis of brain striata from neonates lacking the transcription factor Ctip2. Ctip2 is expressed by striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN), which are critical in motor control and selectively lost in Huntington's disease. Results provide insight into the role of Ctip2 in MSN differentiation.
