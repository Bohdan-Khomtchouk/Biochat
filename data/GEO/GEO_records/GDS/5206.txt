TITLE
Silica nanoparticle effect on lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 cells treated with SiO2 NPs (diameters of 9nm and 18nm) and examined after 3hr and 22hr recovery times. Coated nanomaterials (e.g., SiO2 NPs) agglomerate less and are, thus, more easily inhalable. Results provide molecular insight into molecular basis of nanotoxicological effects.
