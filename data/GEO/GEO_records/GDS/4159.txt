TITLE
LNCap prostate cancer cell line response to loss of COnstitutive Photomorphogenic-1, ETV1 and c-JUN

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCap prostate cancer cells following siRNA-mediated knockdown of COP1, ETV1, and c-JUN. Ubiquitin ligase COP1 (RFWD2) negatively regulates the abundance of ETV1 and c-JUN, both of which have been linked to PC. Results provide insight into the role of COP1 as a tumor suppressor in PC.
