TITLE
Leaf Response to Aphid Feeding

SUMMARY
Analysis of rosette leaves subjected to aphid infestation.  To date, little is known about how plants perceive and defend themselves from phloem-feeding aphids. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of phloem-feeding insect-plant interactions and the development of control strategies.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
