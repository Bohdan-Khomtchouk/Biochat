TITLE
TNF receptor and lymphotoxin beta -receptor activation effect on aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) stimulated with a combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and α-LTβR monoclonal antibody for up to 24 hours. SMCs stimulated by TNF/α-LTβR mAb, but not with either agent alone, differentiate into lymphoid tissue organizer (LTO)-like cells
