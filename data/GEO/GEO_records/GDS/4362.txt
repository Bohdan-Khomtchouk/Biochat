TITLE
Mammary epithelial cell line 184A1 response to dual-pulse epidermal growth factor stimulation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of 184A1 mammary epithelial cells pulsed once or twice with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Normal cells require continuous exposure to growth factors to cross a restriction point and commit to cell-cycle progression. Results provide insight into molecular events regulating S phase entry.
