TITLE
Salicylic acid effect on leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves 2 hours after treatment with salicylic acid (SA) which induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SA-induced genes examined for the presence of neighboring putative binding sites for the transcription factor TGA2. Results provide insight into role of TGA factors in triggering SAR
