TITLE
Cerebral malaria model

SUMMARY
Analysis of C57BL/6 and CBA/CaH animals infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA to induce experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). CM is a complication of P. falciparum infection. ECM in B6 and CBA displays many features of human CM. Results provide insight into the development of treatments for human CM.
