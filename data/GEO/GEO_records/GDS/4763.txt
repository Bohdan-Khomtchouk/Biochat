TITLE
HER2 and MYC overexpression effect on MCF10A-immortalized breast epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A cells overexpressing the HER2 and MYC oncoproteins. HER2 and MYC are commonly co-amplified in breast cancer and associated with an aggressive phenotype. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of HER2 and MYC cooperation in the development of aggressive tumors.
