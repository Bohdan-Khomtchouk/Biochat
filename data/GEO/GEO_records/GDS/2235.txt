TITLE
Burn sepsis model: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals subjected to moderate burn injury followed two days later by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) to produce sepsis. The dual insult induces a systemic hypermetabolic state. Results provide insight into regulation of the hypermetabolic response in the liver.
