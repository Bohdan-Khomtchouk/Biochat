TITLE
Skeletal muscles of diet sensitive and resistant individuals after completion of a weight loss program

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle from obese diet sensitive and resistant women after completion of a weight loss program. Subjects are in the highest and lowest quintiles for weight loss rate. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the variability in weight loss during caloric restriction.
