TITLE
Norflurazon effect on whole seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of 5-day-old, light-grown gun1-9 and gun5 mutant whole seedlings treated with  norflurazon, an inhibitor of chloroplast development. GUN1 and GUN5 are involved in plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Results provide insight into nuclear genes under the control of retrograde pathways.
