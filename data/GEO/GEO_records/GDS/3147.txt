TITLE
GL7 determinant in various B-cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of B-cell lines representing myeloma and Burkitt's lymphoma and exhibiting varied GL7 epitope expression. GL7high B-cells have higher functional activity for producing antibodies and presenting antigens. Results identify a candidate gene responsible for the biosynthesis of the GL7 epitope.
