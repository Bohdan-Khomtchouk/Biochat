TITLE
Adrenocortical adenomas harboring β-catenin gene CTNNB1 mutations

SUMMARY
Analysis of adrenocortical adenomas (AA) with β-catenin missense mutations and AAs with wild-type CTNNB1. Mutations of CTNNB1 are common in AA and adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms deregulated in adrenocortical tumors with CTNNB1 genetic alterations.
