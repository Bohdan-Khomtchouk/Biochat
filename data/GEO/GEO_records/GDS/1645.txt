TITLE
Nitric oxide effect on soluble guanylate cyclase deficient cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of soluble guanylate cyclase-deficient U937 cells exposed to the nitric oxide (NO) donor S-nitrosoglutathione. Cells treated in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) to block signaling due to NO-induced decreases in cAMP. Results provide insight into the cGMP-independent effects of NO.
