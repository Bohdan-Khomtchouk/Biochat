TITLE
β-Catenin stabilized cardiac progenitor cells in vivo

SUMMARY
Analysis of β-Catenin-stabilized cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) from  E9.0 mutant embryos, before cardiac dysfunction. β-Catenin signaling promotes expansion of multipotent CPCs in vivo. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CPC expansion.
