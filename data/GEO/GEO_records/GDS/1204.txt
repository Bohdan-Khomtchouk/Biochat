TITLE
Lung cancer cell line response to motexafin gadolinium: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of lung cancer cell line A549 following treatment with 50 uM of the metal cation-containing chemotherapeutic drug motexafin gadolinium (MGd). Cells examined at 4, 12, and 24 hours following treatment. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of MGd.
