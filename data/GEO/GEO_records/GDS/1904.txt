TITLE
Various wild-type tissues: glycogene expression profile

SUMMARY
Analysis of various wild type murine tissues using a glycogene array. Glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modification of proteins. Results used to determine whether glycogene expression profiles could be used for the analysis of glycan synthesis and function.

ORGANISM
