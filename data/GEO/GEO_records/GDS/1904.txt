TITLE
Various wild-type tissues: glycogene expression profile

SUMMARY
Analysis of various wild type murine tissues using a glycogene array. Glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modification of proteins. Results used to determine whether glycogene expression profiles could be used for the analysis of glycan synthesis and function.
