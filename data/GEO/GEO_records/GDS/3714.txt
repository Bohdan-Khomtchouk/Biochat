TITLE
Ecotropic viral integration site-1 expression effect on primary bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of C57BL/6 mononuclear bone marrow cells transduced with ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI-1). EVI-1 is one of the dominant oncogenes associated with murine and human myeloid leukemia. Results provide insight into the mechanistic basis of Evi1-mediated leukemogenesis.
