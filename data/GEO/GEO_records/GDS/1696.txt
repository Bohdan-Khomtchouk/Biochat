TITLE
Nanosecond pulsed electric fields effect: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Jurkat cells 30min and 60min after exposure to nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) for two consecutive 10 ns pulses at 280kV/cm. Results provide insight into the early response genes to DNA damage caused by electric field radiation.
