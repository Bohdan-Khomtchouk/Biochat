TITLE
Neuroblastoma SKNAS induced cancer stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of phenotypically stabilized stem cell-like NB cells (iCSCs) established from SKNAS NB cells by DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5AdC) treatment followed by sphere-forming culture conditions. Results provide insight into the molecular characteristics of SKNAS iCSCs.
