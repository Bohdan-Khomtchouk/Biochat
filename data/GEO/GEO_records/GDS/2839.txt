TITLE
Phenylethyl isothiocyanate and N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine cotreatment effect on the esophagus

SUMMARY
Analysis of esophagi of animals treated with the carcinogen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA), the chemopreventive agent phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), or both compounds. Results provide insight into effect of PEITC on the development of NMBA-induced esophageal tumorigenesis.
