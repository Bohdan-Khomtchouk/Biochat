TITLE
Progerin expression in a hTERT-immortalized skin fibroblast cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin fibroblasts induced to express GFP-progerin for up to 10 days. Progerin is a mutant form of lamin A and the causal agent of premature-ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this pathological effect.
