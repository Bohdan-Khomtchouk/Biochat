TITLE
Group A streptococcus clinical isolates from pharyngeal and invasive diseases

SUMMARY
Analysis of group A streptococcus (GAS) clinical isolates from patients with significantly different disease manifestations: pharyngitis and invasive disease. Results identify two fundamentally different transcriptomes, thus providing insight into the phenotypic variation of this microbial pathogen.

ORGANISM
Borreliella burgdorferi
