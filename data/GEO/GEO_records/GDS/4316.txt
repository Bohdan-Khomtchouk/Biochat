TITLE
Heart, kidney and lung during juvenile growth

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart, kidney, and lung from C57BL/6 males at 1, 4,  8 weeks of age. Mammalian somatic growth is rapid in early postnatal life but slows and eventually ceases in multiple tissues. Results provide insight into molecular events common to multiple tissues that regulate growth deceleration.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
