TITLE
Nonsense mediated decay factor UPF1 depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells depleted for the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-keys factor UPF1. NMD represents a key mechanism to control the expression of wild-type and aberrant mRNAs. Results provide insight into the extent of gene regulation mediated by UPF1 activity.
