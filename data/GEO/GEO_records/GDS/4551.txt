TITLE
Interleukin-10 effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of healthy PBMCs stimulated with IL-10. PBMC results integrated with tuberculosis and leprosy transcriptional profiles provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which type I interferons (e.g., IFN-Î² and downstream gene IL-10) may suppress type II interferon anti-mycobacterial responses.
