TITLE
CD8+ effector and central memory T cells (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Identification of mechanisms by which activated mast cells induce chemotaxis of antigen-experienced CD8+ effector (TEFF) but not central (TCM) memory T cells. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) implicated in recruitment of TEFF cells to sites of allergic inflammation.
