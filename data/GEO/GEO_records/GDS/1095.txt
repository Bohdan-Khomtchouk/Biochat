TITLE
Hematopoeitic stem cells of various types

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Lin-CD34-, Lin-CD34+, and Lin+CD34+ peripheral blood hematopoeitic stem cells (HSCs). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the association of CD34 expression with self-renewal and lineage commitment in HSCs.
