TITLE
Anastrozole/Fulvestrant/Gefitinib neoadjuvant therapy of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients: tumor core biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of pre and post (3 wk) tumor core biopsies of postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- breast cancer (BC) in neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant with/without gefitinib. Results provide insight into mechanisms of resistance and inhibition of hormone receptors targeted in BC therapy.
