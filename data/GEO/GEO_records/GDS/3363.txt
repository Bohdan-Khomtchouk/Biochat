TITLE
Airway epithelial cells response to hypochlorous acid: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of primary airway epithelial cells (AEC) treated with 0.4, 1 or 4mM hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is a potent oxidative agent that can be generated by neutrophils in inflammatory diseases of airways. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying HOCl-induced toxicity in AECs.
