TITLE
Nonobese diabetic NOD spleen CD4 T-cells: 4-week old females

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4 T-cells from 4-week old NOD females in the preinsulitis stage of Type 1 diabetes. Control strains NOR (~88% similarity to NOD genome) and C57BL/6 (genetically distant) are both insulitis- and diabetes-free. Results provide insight into molecular basis of CD4 T-cell diabetogenesis.
