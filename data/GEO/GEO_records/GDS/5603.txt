TITLE
Ventricular cardiomyocytes generated in vitro from embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventricular cardiomyocytes derived from HES2 embryonic stem cells (hESC-VCMs). The in vivo counterparts (undifferentiated HES2 cells, fetal VCMs, and adult VCMs) were also examined. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental status of hESC-VCMs.
