TITLE
Bone morphogenetic protein 4 effect on a stem cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) stem cells committed to the adipocyte lineage by treatment with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying adipocyte commitment in a stem cell line.
