TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis lungs

Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs following growth in minimal media. P. aeruginosa infected CF lungs are characterized by high cell density (HCD) replication of this pathogen. Results provide insight into the mechanisms sustaining HCD replication.
