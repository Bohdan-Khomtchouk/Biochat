TITLE
Pancreatic cancer-stellate cell organotypic cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of organotypic cultures constructed by seeding Capan1 pancreatic cancer cells on top of PS1 stromal pancreatic stellate cells embedded in a collagen/Matrigel matrix. PS1 cells are activated in pancreatic cancer. Results provide insight into the role of stromal cells in cancer progression.
