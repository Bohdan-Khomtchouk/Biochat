TITLE
Cumulus oocyte complex during ovulation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) isolated from ovaries prior to ovulation or from the oviduct after ovulation. Follicular growth stimulated using equine chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and ovulation induced using human CG. Results identify candidate genes in COCs that impact ovulation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
