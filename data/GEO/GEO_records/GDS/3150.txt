TITLE
Renal inner medullary collecting duct cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells isolated from the renal inner medulla. The IMCD is the terminal portion of the kidney's collecting duct system. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying aquaporin-2 regulation and osmotic water permeability in the IMCD.
