TITLE
MMTV/c-MYC transgenic model of breast cancer: peripheral blood cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBCs from FVB/NJ female, MMTV/c-MYC transgenics with advanced mammary tumors versus tumor-free controls matched for age and parity. These results, together with results from breast cancer patients, provide a foundation for developing a human breast tumor predictor.
