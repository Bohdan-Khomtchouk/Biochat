TITLE
Multiple myeloma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of multiple myeloma (MM) tumors and splenic B cells from transgenics overexpressing XBP-1s. XBP-1s is a spliced isoform of XBP-1, a factor that governs unfolded protein/ER stress response and plasma-cell development. Results provide insight into the role of XBP-1 in MM pathogenesis.
