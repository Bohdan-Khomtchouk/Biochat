TITLE
Transcription factor Tcf1 knockout effect on pancreatic islets (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islets from 6 to 8 week old Tcf1 knockouts. Mutations in Tcf1 lead to a subtype of type 2 diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in humans. Results identify potential targets of Tcf1 that may be responsible for mediating pancreatic beta cell growth.
