TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor 2 effect on lens epithelia explant cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lens explant cultures grown overnight in the presence of 5 ng/mL FGF2 to promote proliferation and survival, then treated with 100 ng/mL FGF2 for up to 24hr to induce differentiation. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of FGF2-induced lens fiber cell differentiation.
