TITLE
Alveolar epithelial cell line A549 response to acute lung injury causing stimuli: time course

SUMMARY
Examination of alveolar epithelial A549 cells in models of pulmonary parenchymal cell activation: exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or cyclic stretch. Cells examined 1 and 4 hours after exposure to each acute lung injury-causing stimulus.
