TITLE
Diet-induced model of obesity: mesenteric adipose tissue surrounding pancreas

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose depot surrounding pancreas from cafeteria diet fed Wistar males. In obesity, β-cell mass increases in response to rising insulin demand; this β-cell plasticity is essential to avoid hyperglycemia onset. Results provide insight into molecular basis of β-cell mass adaptation.
