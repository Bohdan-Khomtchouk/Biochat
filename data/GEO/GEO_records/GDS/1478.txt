TITLE
Intestinal epithelial cell response to probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917

SUMMARY
Analysis of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells cocultured for 6 hours with the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN). A controlled clinical trial suggests that EcN is effective in remission maintenance of ulcerative colitis. Results provide insight into EcN-host interactions.
