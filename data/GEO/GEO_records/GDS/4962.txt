TITLE
Transcription factor ETS fusion EWS/FLI1 knockdown in Ewing sarcoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of A673 Ewing Sarcoma cell line for up to 96hrs after inducible EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown. Oncogenic ETS fusions are driver mutations in diverse cancers, including Ewing sarcoma. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ETS-driven tumorigenesis.
