TITLE
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease comparison: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Results identify a PBMC expression signature that distinguishes between CD and UC, suggesting that diagnosis of these two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using PBMCs is possible.
