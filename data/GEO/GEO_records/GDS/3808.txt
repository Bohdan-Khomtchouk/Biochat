TITLE
Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid and metformin effect on 3T3-L1 adipocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipocytes treated with trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid in conjunction with AMPK activator metformin.  The combined treatment results in greater triglyceride (TG) reduction than with the individual chemicals. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the TG reduction.
