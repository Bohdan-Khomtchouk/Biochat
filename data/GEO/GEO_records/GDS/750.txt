TITLE
HAC1 transcription and unfolded protein response

SUMMARY
Strains expressing HAC1 under various promoters were grown at 30°C, or shifted from 23°C to 37°C, and treated with 6mM DTT or tunicamycin for 60 minutes. DTT and tunicamycin activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is regulated by Hac1p.
