TITLE
Cytokinin effect on rice roots and leaves: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of rice roots and leaves 30 and 120 minutes after treatment with the cytokinin trans-zeatin (tZ). Cytokinins (CKs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate the growth and development of plants. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulated by CK in rice.
