TITLE
Inadequate dietary protein intake effect on the skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies from older males and females (aged 55-80 years) before and during a diet inadequate in proteins. Results provide insight into the molecular changes in skeletal muscles brought about by inadequate dietary protein intake.
