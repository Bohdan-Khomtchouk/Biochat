TITLE
Benzothiadiazole effect on Oryza sativa leaves

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves of Oryza sativa plants treated with benzothiadiazole (BTH). BTH is a functional analog of salicylic acid and enhances the resistance of rice to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying BTH-induced disease resistance.
