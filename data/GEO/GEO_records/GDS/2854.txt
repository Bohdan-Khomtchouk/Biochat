TITLE
Myogenic transcription factor MyoD mutant expression effect on embryonic fibroblast: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts at various time points up to 24 hours following transcriptional induction of a mutant form of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD. MyoD altered at lysine residues 99, 102, and 104, rendering it not acetylatable.
