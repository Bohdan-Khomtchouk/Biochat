TITLE
Psoriasis response to brodalumab: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-lesional and lesional psoriatic skins for up to 43 days following treatment with various doses of brodalumab, a human IgG2 mAb that selectively binds and blocks signaling through IL-17RA. Results provide insight into the molecular effect of blocking IL-17 signaling in psoriatic skin.
