TITLE
MYC-driven medulloblastoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of Myc/DNp53-infected tumors derived from stem cells or progenitors, uninfected stem cells, and patched tumor cells. Cerebellar stem cells expressing Myc and mutant Trp53 generate tumors similar to MYC-driven medulloblastoma (MB). Results provide insight into transformation to MB tumor.

ORGANISM
