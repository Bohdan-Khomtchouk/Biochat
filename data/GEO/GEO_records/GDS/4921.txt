TITLE
Embryonic anterior and posterior palate

SUMMARY
Analysis of anterior and posterior portions of the palate from wild-type animals at embryonic day 15.5. Results, together with those from GDS5644, provide insight into the role of Transforming growth factor, beta (TGFβ) signaling across the soft palate during development.
