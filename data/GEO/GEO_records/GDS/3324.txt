TITLE
Stromal cells and invasive breast cancer development

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelium and stroma cells in normal and invasive breast cancer tissues. Information on the role that stroma tissues have on the growth and progression of cancer is limited.Results provide insights into the molecular basis of cancer invasion and metastasis.
