TITLE
Low-dose cadmium effect on prostate epithelial cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell line NPrEC exposed to non-cytotoxic levels of cadmium (2.5uM CdCl2) for up to 32hrs. Cadmium is implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying the initiation of carcinogenesis by Cd in the prostate.
