TITLE
KinB and RpoN deletion effects on alginate overproduction

SUMMARY
Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 mucoid kinB mutant and nonmucoid kinB rpoN double mutant. Deletion of the sensor kinase KinB  results in alginate overproduction, a trait associated with chronic endobronchial infections in cystic fibrosis. Sigma Factor RpoN is required for mucoid induction.
