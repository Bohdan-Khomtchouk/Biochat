TITLE
High light stress effect on cell suspension cultures containing functional chloroplasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of Arabidopsis cell suspension culture (ACSC), containing functional chloroplasts, subjected to high light. Several reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated under HL conditions. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying early defense responses to HL stress.
