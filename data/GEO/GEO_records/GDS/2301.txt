TITLE
Noggin and Dkk-1 ectopic expression effect on ventral mesoderm during gastrulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage 10 early and stage 11.5 late gastrula embryos ectopically expressing Noggin, Dkk-1, or both to induce different aspects of organizer activity. The organizer patterns vertebrate embryos during gastrulation. Results provide insight into organizer function during gastrulation.

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis
