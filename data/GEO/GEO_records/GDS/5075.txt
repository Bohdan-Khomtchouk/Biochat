TITLE
Myotube response to prion infection in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-proliferating myotubes infected with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory prion strain. Myotubes derived from the C2C12 myoblast cell line. Non-proliferating cells accumulate high levels of prions. Results provide insight into the cellular impact of prion infection.
