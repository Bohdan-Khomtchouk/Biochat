TITLE
Developing testis and ovary

SUMMARY
Analysis of germ cells, supporting cells, interstitial cells (including steroidogenic precursors), and endothelial cells in the developing gonads at 11.5, 12.5, and 13.5 dpc. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the adoption of testis or ovary fate by the developing gonad.
