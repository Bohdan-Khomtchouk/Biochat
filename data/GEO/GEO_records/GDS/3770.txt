TITLE
Early-passage induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from various somatic cell populations

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPSCs (at p4) derived from different cell types (fibroblasts, hematopoietic, myogenic cells) through ectopic expression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc. Results provide insight into the influence of cellular origin on transcriptional patterns of derivative iPSCs.
