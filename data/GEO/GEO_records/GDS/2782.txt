TITLE
Androgen response element specific DNA-binding polyamide effect on dihydrotestoterone-stimulated prostate cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of DHT-stimulated LNCaP prostate cells treated with an androgen response (AR) element (ARE) specific DNA binding polyamide. Polyamide designed to target the sequence 5'-WGWWCW-3' and disrupt AR-mediated gene expression. Effects of the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide also examined.
