TITLE
Scott syndrome B lymphoblast response to calcium ionophore

SUMMARY
Analysis of Scott B lymphoblasts after calcium ionophore A23187 treatment. Lymphoblasts derived from a patient with Scott syndrome, a hemorrhagic disease. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of A23187, and susceptibility of Scott B lymphoblasts to apoptosis.
