TITLE
SW480 KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cell line response to dual inhibition of tankyrase and MEK: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of SW480 cancer cells treated with tankyrase inhibitor, MEK inhibitor, or both, for up to 16hrs. Dual inhibition of TNKS and MEK led to tumor regression. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of TNKS and MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cancers.
