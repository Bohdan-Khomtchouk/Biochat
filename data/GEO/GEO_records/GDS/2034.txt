TITLE
Prostate cancer cell line LNCaP response to synthetic androgen R1881: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of prostate cancer cell line LNCaP treated for up to 8 hours with the synthetic androgen R1881. LNCaP cells grow slowly in medium devoid of steroids but resume growth upon the addition of androgens. The study aims to identify direct targets of the androgen receptor.
