TITLE
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) interruption effect on HIV patients: jejunal mucosa

SUMMARY
Analysis of gut biopsies from HIV+ patients following interruption of HAART. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a critical host-pathogen interaction site in HIV infection. Results provide insight into molecular basis of host response to viral rebound in GALT following HAART interruption.
