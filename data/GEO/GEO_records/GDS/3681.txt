TITLE
Type 2 diabetes: myotube

SUMMARY
Analysis of myotube cell lines established from type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects. Insulin resistance and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis coexist early in T2D pathogenesis independent of hyperglycemia and obesity. Results provide insight into the effect of T2D on developing skeletal muscle cells.
