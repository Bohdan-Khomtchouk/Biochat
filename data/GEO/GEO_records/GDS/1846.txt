TITLE
Interferon gamma effect on keratinocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes treated with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) for up to 48 hours. IFN-gamma is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory cytokine with cell type-specific antiviral activities. Results provide insight into molecular processes regulated by IFN-gamma in keratinocytes.
