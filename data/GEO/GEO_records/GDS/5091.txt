TITLE
Cystatin B knockout model of progressive myoclonus epilepsy: cultured cerebellar granule cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of granule cells dissected from postnatal day 5 cystatin B (CSTB)-deficient mice and cultured for 2 days. Progressive myoclonus epilepsy Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CSTB gene mutations. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of EPM1.
