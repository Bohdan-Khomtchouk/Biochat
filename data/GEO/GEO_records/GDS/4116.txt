TITLE
Diabetogenic BDC T-cell transfer model of type I diabetes: pancreatic islets

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islets after injection of diabetogenic BDC CD4 T cells into nondiabetic NOD Rag1-/- recipients, 24 to 48 hrs post-transfer. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the T-cell entry induced state of receptivity of islets to subsequent immunological insults.
