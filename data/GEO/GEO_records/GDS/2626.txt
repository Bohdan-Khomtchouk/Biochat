TITLE
Epidermal growth factor and heregulin effect on breast cancer cell line: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with various doses of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG) for up to 90 minutes. EGF and HRG induce distinct kinase kinetics and phenotypes of MCF-7 cells. Results provide insight into the linkage between signaling dynamics and cell fate.
