TITLE
WTX overexpression effect on kidney cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 embryonic kidney cells overexpressing WTX, a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in Wilms tumor. Ectopic expression of WTX in HEK293 cells activates p53 through lysine acetylation. Results provide insight into a role for WTX in the regulation of p53 activity.
