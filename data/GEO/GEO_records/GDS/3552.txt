TITLE
Caveolin-3 deficiency effect on hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts lacking caveolin-3 (Cav3), the primary protein component of caveolae in muscle cells. Cav3 deficiency leads to cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy induced by Cav3 deficiency.
