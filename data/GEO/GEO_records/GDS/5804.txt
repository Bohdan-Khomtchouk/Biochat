TITLE
PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 and taxotere effects on prostate cancer xenograft tumors

SUMMARY
Analysis of DU145 xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID mice treated with NVP-BEZ235, taxotere, or both. NVP-BEZ235 targets prostate cancer progenitor cells. Taxotere targets the bulk tumor. Results provide insight into potential biomarkers associated with cancer stem cells in these xenograft tumors.
