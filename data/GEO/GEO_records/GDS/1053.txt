TITLE
Growth hormone receptor mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver of 42 day old male mutants expressing growth hormone receptor (GHR) proteins truncated at amino acid residues 569 or 391. Receptors truncated at residue 569 have residues 539 and 545 replaced with phenylalanine. Results provide insight into the function of regions of GHR.
