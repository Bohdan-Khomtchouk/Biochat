TITLE
Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: epidermis

SUMMARY
Analysis of epidermal punch biopsies (with minimal dermis amounts) from six EBS patients. Most EBS cases are caused by defects in the genes encoding intermediate filament proteins keratin 5 (KRT5) and keratin 14 (KRT14). Results provide further insight into the molecular basis of EBS.
