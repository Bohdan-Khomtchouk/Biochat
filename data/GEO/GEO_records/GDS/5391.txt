TITLE
Protein tyrosine kinase PTK7 knockdown effect on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) cell lines NCI-H1299 and NCI-H2009 depleted for protein tyrosine kinase PTK7 using two independent shRNAs (shPTK7-1 and shPTK7-2). Results provide insight into the role of PTK7 in lung ADCs.
