TITLE
Inbred Long Sleep and Inbred Short Sleep model of ethanol sensitivity: cerebellum (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Comparison of cerebella of Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS) animals. ILS animals are more sensitive than ISS animals to ethanol. Initial sensitivity to ethanol is a predictor of alcohol abuse. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of differential ethanol sensitivity.
