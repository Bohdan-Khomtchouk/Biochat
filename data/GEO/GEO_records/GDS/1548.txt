TITLE
Neuroblastoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of four cell lines initially established as neuroblastomas. Results indicate that the SK-N-MC cell line expresses all of the Ewing Family Tumor (EFT) signature genes. EFTs are small round blue cell tumors that show features of neuroectodermal differentiation.
