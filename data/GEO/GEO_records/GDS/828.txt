TITLE
Insulitis: comparison of innocuous and destructive forms

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ automimmune T and CD45+ hematopoeitic cells from non-obese diabetic (NOD) and C57BL/6-H-2 g7 transgenics with the BDC2.5 T cell receptor (TCR) from a diabetogenic T cell.  BDC2.5 TCR in NOD and in C57BL/6-H-2 g7 results in innocuous and destructive insulitis respectively.
