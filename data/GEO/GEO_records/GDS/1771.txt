TITLE
MicroRNA miR-430 effect on maternal-zygotic (MZ) dicer mutant embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of maternal-zygotic (MZ) dicer mutant embryos that lack miR-430 and mutants rescued with miR-430. MZdicer mutants cannot generate mature miRNAs; miR-430 accumulates during maternal-to-zygotic transition and regulates morphogenesis during early development. Results identify miR-430 targets.
