TITLE
Pregnancy effect on liver of cytochrome P450 2D6 hepatic metabolism model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)-humanized mice at various gestational stages: pre-pregnancy, 21 days of pregnancy, and 7 days postpartum. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying increased CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism during pregnancy.
