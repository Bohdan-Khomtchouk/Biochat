TITLE
Transcription factor engrailed-2 loss-of-function model of autism spectrum disorder: cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebellar samples from engrailed-2 (En2) mutant adults. The En2-/- animals are a model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The cerebellum is a brain area profoundly affected in ASD patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying ASD-related neuropathology.
