TITLE
Leaf response to fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3-week-old cv. 5601 T plants (V2 growth stage) inoculated with Phakopsora pachyrhizi. This fungal pathogen is the causal agent of Asian soybean rust (ASR), a potentially devastating disease affecting crops. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the host response to ASR.
