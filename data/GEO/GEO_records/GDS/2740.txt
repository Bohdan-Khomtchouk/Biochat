TITLE
Lengthening and shortening contractions effect on the muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles at various time points up to 24 hours after acute bouts of either lengthening (LCs) or shortening contractions (SCs). Resistance training using LCs results in greater increases in muscle size than SCs. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this difference.
