TITLE
Type 2 diabetes: pancreatic beta-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of beta-cell enriched pancreatic tissue obtained by laser capture microdissection from subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In subjects predisposed to T2D, beta-cell dysfunction occurs early in the course of the disease. Results provide further insight into the pathogenesis of T2D.
