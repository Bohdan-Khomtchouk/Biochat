TITLE
Imatinib mesylate effect on EOL-1 eosinophilic leukemia cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of EOL-1 cells treated with imatinib mesylate (1uM, 6h). EOL-1 cells carry the platelet derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRA)/FIP1L1 fusion and exhibit constitutive PDGFRA activation. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of inhibiting PDGFRA signaling by imatinib.
