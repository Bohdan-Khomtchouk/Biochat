TITLE
Non-syndromic cleft lip and palate: dental pulp stem cell cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of NSCL/P dental pulp stem cells cultures. This cell source consists of mesodermal and neural crest derived cells and, therefore, it shares the same origin with cells involved in lip and palate morphogenesis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying NSCL/P etiology.
