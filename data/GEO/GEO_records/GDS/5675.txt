TITLE
Histone deacetylase HDAC7 re-expression effect on pre-B cell transdifferentiation into macrophages: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of C10 pre-B cells transduced with a vector for HDAC7 expression then treated with β-estradiol to induce transdifferentiation into macrophages for up to 72 hr. Dysregulated HDAC activity is associated with B cell malignancies. Results provide insight into role of HDAC7 in B lymphopoiesis.

CITATIONS
Barneda-Zahonero B, Román-González L, Collazo O, Rafati H et al. HDAC7 is a repressor of myeloid genes whose downregulation is required for transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages. PLoS Genet 2013 May;9(5):e1003503. PMID:  23696748
