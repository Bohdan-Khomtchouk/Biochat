TITLE
In vitro-differentiated CD4+ T helper cell subsets

SUMMARY
Analysis of naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the absence of exogenous cytokines (Th0 cells), or differentiated with IL-27 plus TGF-β (Tr-1 cells) or with IL-6 plus TGF-β (Th17 cells). Results provide insight into the molecular bases of the T cell subsets.
