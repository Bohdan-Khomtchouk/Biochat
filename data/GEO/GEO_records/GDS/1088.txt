TITLE
Normal tissues of diverse types (SHDP)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 115 samples from 35 different types of normal tissues. Samples obtained by surgery or autopsy, and evaluated by pathologists. Results provide insight into the molecular organization of diverse cell types, and provide a baseline for comparison to diseased tissues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

PLATFORM
GPL1826 : SHDP
