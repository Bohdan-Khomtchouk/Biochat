TITLE
Small-molecule inhibition of BRDT effect on testis

SUMMARY
Analysis of testes from animals treated with JQ1, a small-molecule inhibitor of the testis-specific bromodomain-containing protein BRDT. BRDT is essential for spermatogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular consequences of BRDT inhibition by JQ1.
