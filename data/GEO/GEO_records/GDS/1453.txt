TITLE
Camptothecin effect on renal epithelial cell line and HIV transduction

SUMMARY
Analysis of renal epithelial cell line 293T following treatment with 2 uM camptothecin, which boosts transduction of cells by HIV. Camptothecin induces DNA damage and arrests cell cycle at G2/M. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying HIV transduction boost induced by camptothecin.
