TITLE
Exercise effect on high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR): skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of soleus muscle of animals artificially selected for high and low inborn maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) that were subjected to exercise-training. Low VO2max has a strong link to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying low VO2max.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
