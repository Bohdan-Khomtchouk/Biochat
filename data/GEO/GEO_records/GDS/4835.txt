TITLE
Transcription factor treatment effect on embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts transduced with various transcription factor combinations (MEF2C, TBX5, NKX2.5, GATA4, Hand2, MYOCD) to drive transdifferentiation to induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms governing direct fibroblast reprogramming to iCMs.
