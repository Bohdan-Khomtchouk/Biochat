TITLE
Notch ligand delta-like 4 effect on interleukin 10-secreting T helper 1 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of IL-10-secreting and -nonsecreting T helper 1 (Th1) cells stimulated with Notch ligand Delta-like 4. The Notch pathway is a major driver of IL-10 production in Th1 cells.  Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Notch-mediated IL-10 induction in Th1 cells.
