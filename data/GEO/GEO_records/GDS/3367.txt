TITLE
Argyrin A effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells treated with argyrin A, a proteasome inhibitor that induces apoptosis by stabilizing cyclin kinase inhibitor p27kip1. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that make argyrin A-induced cell death dependent upon p27kip1 expression.
