TITLE
Isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy and exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy

SUMMARY
Comparison of hearts of C57BL/6 males with isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy to those with exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Results provide insight into the molecular differences between pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy models.
