TITLE
Interferon-gamma effect on peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 or GM-CSF, IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ for 6d. Results provide insight into effects of IFN-γ on differentiation and maturation of peripheral blood moDC.
