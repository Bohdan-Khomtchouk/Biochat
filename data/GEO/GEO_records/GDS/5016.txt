TITLE
Male and female in vitro cultured placental cell types

SUMMARY
Analysis of four cell types from the placentas of male or female fetuses: cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and arterial and venous endothelial cells. Results provide insight into sex-biased molecular mechanisms underlying functional differences in gestations from male and female fetuses.
