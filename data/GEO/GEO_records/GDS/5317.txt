TITLE
Drug efflux transporter ABCB5 knockdown effect on A375 melanoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of nonpigmented melanoma A375 cell line following ABCB5 ablation. ABCB5 [ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 5] is a drug efflux transporter shown to be highly overexpressed in diverse human cancers.   Results provide insight into the role of ABCB5 in melanoma.
