TITLE
Rho/CRIK signaling modulation effect on keratinocyte

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes expressing activated Rho or Citron kinase (CRIK), or treated with C3 transferase. Rho plays a positive role during early differentiation, CRIK is a Rho effector, and C3 is a Rho inhibitor. Results provide insight into the role of Rho/CRIK in later stages of differentiation.
