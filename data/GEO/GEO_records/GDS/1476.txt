TITLE
Uterine fibroids with fumarate hydratase mutations

SUMMARY
Analysis of 7 uterine fibroids carrying fumarate hydratase (FH) mutations. FH catalyzes hydration of fumarate in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. Results provide insight into the connection between the disruption of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and neoplasia.
