TITLE
LNCap prostate cancer cell line response to loss of COnstitutive Photomorphogenic-1 and ETV1

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCap prostate cancer (PC) cells following siRNA-mediated knockdown of COP1 and ETV1. Ubiquitin ligase COP1 (RFWD2) negatively regulates proto-oncogene ETV1 which has been linked to PC. Results provide insight into the role of COP1 as a tumor suppressor in PC.
