TITLE
ER-positive/HER2-negative and ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer biopsies (MDACC/IGR cohort)

SUMMARY
Analysis of pre-treatment biopsies from 103 HER2-normal breast cancer patients (ER-positive and ER-negative subtypes) from MD Anderson Cancer Center/Institut Goustave Russy. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms associated with chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer subtypes.
