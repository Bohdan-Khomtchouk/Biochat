TITLE
Azaspiracid-1 effect on T lymphocyte cell line: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of T lymphocyte Jurkat cells treated with 1 or 10 nM azaspiracid-1 (AZA-1) for up to 24 hours. AZA-1 is a marine biotoxin reported to accumulate in shellfish and is associated with severe gastrointestinal intoxication. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of AZA-1.
