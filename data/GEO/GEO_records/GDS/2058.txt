TITLE
Androgen receptor modulator effect: time course (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP cells treated for 6 and 24 hours with RTI-018, an androgen receptor (AR) ligand with a mechanism of action different from that of canonical agonists. Results provide insight into the link between RTI-018 induced AR conformational changes and its ability to regulate gene expression.
