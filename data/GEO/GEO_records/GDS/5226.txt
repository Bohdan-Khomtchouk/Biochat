TITLE
Age effect on adipocytes of the bone marrow and epididymis

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes of 6 to 18 month old C57BL/6J animals. Aging is associated with impaired adipogenesis in various fat depots. An increase in bone marrow adiposity is associated with age-related bone disease.
