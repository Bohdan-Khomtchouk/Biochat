TITLE
Germinal vesicle stage and metaphase II stage oocyte comparison

SUMMARY
Comparison of oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage (GV) to those at the metaphase II (MII) stage. GV-stage oocytes are transcriptionally silent. Results show that the destruction of transcripts that occurs during oocyte maturation is selective.
