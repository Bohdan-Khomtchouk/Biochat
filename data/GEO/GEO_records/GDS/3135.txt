TITLE
Brown adipose tissue response to fasting

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown (BATs) and white adipose tissues (WATs) and livers of animals after a 24 hour fast. WAT stores and releases fat in response to nutritional needs, while BAT dissipates fat to produce heat. Results provide insight into the role of BAT in the adaptation to food deprivation.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
