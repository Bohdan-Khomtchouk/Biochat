TITLE
Lung response to highly virulent or low virulent influenza A H3N2 virus infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of total lung from BALB/c females infected with highly virulent influenza A (HVI) or low virulent influenza A (LVI), up to 96 hrs following infection. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the host pulmonary responses to HVI and LVI infections.
