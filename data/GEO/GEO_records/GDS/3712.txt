TITLE
Nephrosclerosis: glomeruli

SUMMARY
Analysis of glomeruli microdissected from renal biopsy specimens from 14 patients with nephrosclerosis (NSC). Tumor-free kidney specimens from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomy (TN) served as controls. Results provide insight into the role of hypoxia in glomerulopathies such as NSC.
