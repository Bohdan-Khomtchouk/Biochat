TITLE
Spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion

SUMMARY
Analysis of spinal cord (SC) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and SC; the peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes spinal and cranial nerves along with their associated DRGs. Results identify gene expression differences between the CNS and the PNS.
