TITLE
Neurotoxin trimethyltin effect on neuronal cell line: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis neuronal PC12 cells treated with 1 or 5 uM trimethyltin (TMT). TMT induces neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and limbic system with a delayed onset. Results provide insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to TMT toxicity.
