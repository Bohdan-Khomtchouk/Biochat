TITLE
Phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin activation effect on primary T lymphoblasts and their exosomes

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary T lymphoblasts and derived exosomes after activation with PMA plus ionomycin. Exosomes contain specific RNA species and can be functionally transferred to recipient cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the selective sorting of RNA into exosomes.
