TITLE
Multipotent stromal cell expansion in vitro

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of cultures of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) from bone marrow aspirates from 3 donors. On day 2, the MSCs are in transition from lag phase to log phase; on day 7, they are in stationary phase. Results provide insight into the molecular changes in MSCs during in vitro expansion.
