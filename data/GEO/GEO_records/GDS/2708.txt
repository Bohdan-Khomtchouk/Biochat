TITLE
Quercetin effect on cultured cardiomyocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured cardiomyocytes treated for up to 24 hours with the flavonoid quercetin. Consumption of food rich in quercetin is correlated with a decreased incidence of heart disease. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of quercetin.
