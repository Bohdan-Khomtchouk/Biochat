TITLE
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model

SUMMARY
Analysis of motor neurons of 60, 90, and 120 day old SOD1 G93A transgenics, a model for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of ALS.
