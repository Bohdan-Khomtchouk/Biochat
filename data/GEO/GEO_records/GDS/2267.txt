TITLE
Metabolic cycle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of nutrient-limited continuous-culture cells at 12 25-minute intervals for 3 cycles. Cells grown under such conditions exhibit robust, periodic cycles in the form of respiratory bursts. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms responsible for controlling metabolic oscillations.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
