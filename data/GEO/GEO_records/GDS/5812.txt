TITLE
Staphylococcal alpha-toxin effect on airway epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o- (Hla-susceptible) and S9 (Hla-resistant) treated with S. aureus recombinant alpha-toxin (rHla) for 2 hrs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cell type-specific responses of airway epithelial cells to alpha-toxin.
