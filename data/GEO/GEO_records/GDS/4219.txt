TITLE
Peripheral blood monocyte CD16 + and Cd16- subsets from healthy donors

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood monocyte (Mo) CD16 (FcγRIII) subsets CD16- and CD16+. Increase in circulating CD16+ Mo have been reported in inflammatory pathologies (sepsis/HIV infection). Results provide insight into developmental and functional relationship between CD16+ and CD16- Mo subsets.
