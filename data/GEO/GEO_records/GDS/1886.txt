TITLE
Moderate hypothermia effect in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells exposed to moderate hypothermia (MH) at 32 degrees C for 24 hours. THP-1 cell line is an in vitro system for analyzing the effects of hypothermia. MH has therapeutic applications. Results show substantial changes in gene expression in response to MH.
