TITLE
Chitin oligomer chitooctaose effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of 14-day-old Col-0 seedlings treated with 1 uM chitooctaose for 3 minutes. Chitooctaose, a chitin oligomer, is released by plant enzymes from the cell wall of many plant fungal pathogens. Results provide insight into the plant defense response to fungal elicitors.
