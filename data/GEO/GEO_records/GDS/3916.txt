TITLE
Recombinant human growth hormone effect on lactating mammary gland: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of milk fat globule from milk samples collected from normal, lactating women every 3hr for 4 days (1 day of baseline/pre-rhGH administration and 3 days of high-dose rhGH administration). Results provide insight into potential molecular mechanisms for increasing milk production.
