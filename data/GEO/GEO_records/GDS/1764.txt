TITLE
Various oxidative stress-inducing agents effect on mycelia: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of mycelia at various timepoints up to 9 hours after exposure to diamide, H2O2, or menadione. Specific cell functions are involved in the resistance to each oxidative stress-inducing agent. Results identify transcriptional responses unique to diamide, H2O2, and menadione.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans
