TITLE
SIRT3 knockout effect on brown adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown adipose tissue of sirtuin SIRT3 knockout 129Sv males. SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect, a metabolic reprogramming that provides tumor cells with the substrates required for biomass generation. Results provide insight into the role of SIRT3 in tumorigenesis.
