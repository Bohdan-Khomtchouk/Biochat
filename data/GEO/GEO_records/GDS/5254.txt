TITLE
Pirin depletion effect on myelomonocytic cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of U937 myelomonocytic cells depleted for Pirin. Pirin is silenced in cells with the acute myeloid leukemia-1 eight-twenty-one and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor leukemogenic fusion proteins. Results provide insight into the role of Pirin in myeloid differentiation.
