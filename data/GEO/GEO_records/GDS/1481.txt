TITLE
Obesity: preadipocyte expression profile (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured abdominal subcutaneous preadipocytes from 7 male and 7 female non-diabetic obese Pima Indians. The prevalence of obesity in Pima Indians is among the highest of any population. Results provide insight into the role of preadipocytes in obesity and obesity-related inflammation.
