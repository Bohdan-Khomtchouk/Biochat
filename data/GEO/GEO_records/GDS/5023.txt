TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition effect on malignant urothelial cells deficient in TGFβ-activated kinase 1

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3)-positive, MGHU3 (Y375C) bladder cancer cells depleted for TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) then treated with FGFR-specific PD173074 inhibitor. Results provide insight into the integration of TAK1 and FGFR3 signaling in bladder cancer.
