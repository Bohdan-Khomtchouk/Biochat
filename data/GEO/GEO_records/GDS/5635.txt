TITLE
Chlamydia Type III secretion effector TepP-deficient mutant infection of endocervical epithelial cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of A2EN endocervical epithelial cells infected with a Chlamydia trachomatis mutant strain lacking type III secretion effector TepP (Ct875) or its complemented counterpart for 4hr. Results provide insight into the impact of effector protein TepP on the host cell molecular response.

CITATIONS
Chen YS, Bastidas RJ, Saka HA, Carpenter VK et al. The Chlamydia trachomatis type III secretion chaperone Slc1 engages multiple early effectors, including TepP, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein required for the recruitment of CrkI-II to nascent inclusions and innate immune signaling.
