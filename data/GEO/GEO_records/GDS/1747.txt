TITLE
SOD1-G93A transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: spinal cord

SUMMARY
Analysis of spinal cord from SOD1-G93A transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at 75 or 110 days of age. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase mutations are a cause of ALS. Gene expression results, together with proteomic data, provide insight into functional changes underlying ALS progression.
