TITLE
NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase-loss transgenic models: hepatic expression profiling

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver in two NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)-loss transgenic models: liver-Cpr-null (liver-specific Cpr deletion) and Cpr-low (global Cpr suppression). Results provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying altered hepatic gene expression related to CPR-deficiency.
