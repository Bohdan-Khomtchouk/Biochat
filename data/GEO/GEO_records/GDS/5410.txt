TITLE
Non-small cell lung cancer H460-derived cancer stem cell differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from non-small cell lung cancer cell line H460 and allowed to redifferentiate under adherent conditions in serum-containing media for up to 24hr. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of H460-derived CSCs.
