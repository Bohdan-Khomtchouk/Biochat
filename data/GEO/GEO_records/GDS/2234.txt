TITLE
Skeletal muscle response to endurance exercise training

SUMMARY
Comparison of vastus lateralis muscles of previously sedentary individuals with improved insulin sensitivity (SI) after 20 weeks of exercise to those with no change in SI. Results provide insight into the mechanisms involved in the improvement in SI induced by regular exercise.
