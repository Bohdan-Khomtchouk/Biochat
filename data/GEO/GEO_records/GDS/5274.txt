TITLE
Alopecia areata model: skin

SUMMARY
Analysis of alopecic skin from C3H/HeJ animals. The C3H/HeJ strain develops spontaneous alopecia areata (AA) with high similarity to human AA. AA is an autoimmune disease resulting from damage of hair follicle by T cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying AA pathogenesis.
