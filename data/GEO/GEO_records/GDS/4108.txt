TITLE
Prostate response to activated form of p110β isoform of PI3-kinase

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventral prostate from transgenics expressing a constitutively activated p110β allele in prostate. Activation of the p110β isoform causes mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). Results provide insight into ability of an activated allele of p110β to induce prostatic tumor.
