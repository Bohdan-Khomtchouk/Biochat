TITLE
Huntington's disease CAG knock-in effect on striatum and cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of striatum and cerebellum of HdhQ111/Q111 CAG knock-ins (expressing full-length huntingtin with 111-glutamines) and wild-type HdhQ7/Q7 mice (expressing full-length huntingtin with 7-glutamines). Results provide insight into tissue-specific differences in susceptibility to HD CAG mutation.
