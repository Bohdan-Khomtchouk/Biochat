TITLE
Treacher Collins' syndrome Tcof1 gene overexpression and knockdown effect on neuroblastoma cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells with the Treacher Collins' syndrome (TCS) Tcof1 gene overexpressed or inactivated.  TCS is an autosomal dominant dysostosis of the face and lower jaw. Results provide insight into the role of Tcof1 in neuroblastoma cell proliferation.
