TITLE
miR-221 expression effect on prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of PC-3 prostate cancer cells expressing pre-miR-221. miR-221 is frequently downregulated in primary prostate cancer. Results provide insight into the role of miR-221 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

CITATIONS
Kneitz B, Krebs M, Kalogirou C, Schubert M et al. Survival in patients with high-risk prostate cancer is predicted by miR-221, which regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting IRF2 and SOCS3. Cancer Res 2014 May 1;74(9):2591-603. PMID:Â  24607843
