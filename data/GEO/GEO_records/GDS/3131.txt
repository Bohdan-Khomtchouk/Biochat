TITLE
Hearts from low and high capacity runners with and without exercise training

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts from low (LCRs) and high capacity runners (HCRs) with or without exercise training. Aerobic capacity is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for the difference in inborn aerobic capacity in the LCRs and HCRs.
