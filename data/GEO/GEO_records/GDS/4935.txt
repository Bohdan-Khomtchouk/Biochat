TITLE
Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 overexpression effect on primary pancreatic islets

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary islets transduced with adenovirus overexpressing pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx-1). Homeodomain transcription factor Pdx-1 has key roles in pancreatic development and β-cell function. Results provide further insight into the role of Pdx-1 in pancreatic islets.
