TITLE
Dietary saturated fat effect on small intestine

SUMMARY
Analysis of small intestine divided into 3 equal parts along the proximal to distal axis (SI 1, SI 2, SI 3) from C57Bl/6J males fed high-fat diets varying in polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios (P/S). Results provide insight into role of dietary fat type on development of metabolic syndrome.
