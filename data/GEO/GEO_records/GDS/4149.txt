TITLE
Ataxin-1-Like deficiency effect on lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung of ATAXIN1-Like-/- (Atxn1L-/-) C57BL/6J mice at P6. Alveolarization defects causing air space enlargement were apparent in ATXN1L knockouts at late alveolar stage (P17-23). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating the alveolarization defect.
