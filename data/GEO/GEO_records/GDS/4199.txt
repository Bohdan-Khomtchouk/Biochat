TITLE
Wild-type embryonic stem cell rescue of mdx model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of pectoralis muscle from 4 month-old, wildtype/mdx chimeric males.  Chimeras were created by injecting WT ESCs into mdx mutant blastocysts; injected blastocysts developed in the uterus of pseudopregnant females. Results provide insight into molecular basis of WT ESC rescue of mdx mice.
