TITLE
FHL2 deficiency effect on spontaneously immortalized embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of spontaneously immortalized embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) lacking the LIM-only protein FHL2. FHL2 deficiency results in reduced proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized EFs. Results provide insight into the role of FLH2 in cell cycle and cell proliferation.
