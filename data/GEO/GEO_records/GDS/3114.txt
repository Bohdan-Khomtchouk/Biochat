TITLE
Chronic hypoxia effect on the developing brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain cortices and hypothalami of developing animals subjected to chronic consistent hypoxia (CCH) or chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the long-lasting pathological effects of hypoxia on postnatal brain development.
