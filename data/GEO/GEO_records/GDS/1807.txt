TITLE
Hypoxia effect on B lymphocyte cell line

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of B lymphocyte P493-6 cells subjected to hypoxia. Cells incubated in 0.1% oxygen for 29 hours, the point of highest expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1).  Results identify hypoxia responsive genes in P493-6 cells.
