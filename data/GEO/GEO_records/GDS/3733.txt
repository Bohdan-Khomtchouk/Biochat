TITLE
Growth plate chondrocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of growth plate chondrocytes, representing reserve and hypertrophic zones (RZ and HZ, respectively), isolated from metacarpals of prepubertal males. RZ cells terminally differentiate into non-dividing HZ cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of chondrocyte development.
