TITLE
Obesity: adipocyte expression profile (HG-U95A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured abdominal subcutaneous mature adipocytes from 4 male and 5 female non-diabetic obese Pima Indians. The prevalence of obesity in Pima Indians is among the highest of any population. Results provide insight into the role of adipocytes in obesity and obesity-related inflammation.
