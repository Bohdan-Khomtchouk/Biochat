TITLE
All-trans-retinoic acid effect on transglutaminase 2-silenced, NB4 model of acute promyelocytic leukemia: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of stable TG2-knockdown NB4 APL cells induced to differentiate in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for up to 72 hrs. Silencing of TG2 delays the differentiation process of NB4 cells. Results provide insight into the role of TG2 in the ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells.
