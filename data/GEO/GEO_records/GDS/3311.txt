TITLE
Oxidative stress effect on ATF4 knockout embryonic neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of bZip transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-deficient, embryonic neurons treated with homocysteate (HCA), a glutamate analog that induces oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the role of ATF4 in oxidative stress-induced cell death.
