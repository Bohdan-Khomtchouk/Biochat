TITLE
Pancreatic CD45+ immune cells from NOD model of type 1 diabetes

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic CD45+ cells from 10 week-old NOD females MRI-scanned to noninvasively visualize effects of pancreatic-islet inflammation. All NOD juveniles develop insulitis but vary highly in their progression to diabetes. Results provide insight into molecular basis of disease progression.
