TITLE
HIV viremia effect on monocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD14+ monocytes from 8 HIV patients at the aviremic state during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and at the viremic state after the cessation of HAART. Results provide insight into the impact of HIV infection and high-level HIV viremia on the function of monocytes.
