TITLE
Salt stress effect on mannitol-producing, salt-tolerant  M6PR transgenic plant: leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaf from mannose-6-phosphate reductase (M6PR) transgenic plants subjected to salt stress (100mM NaCl). M6PR transgenics were dramatically more salt tolerant relative to the wild type. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of mannitol-enhanced, stress tolerance in plants.
