TITLE
X-Box binding protein overexpression effect on breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 breast cancer (BC) cells overexpressing spliced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), a transcription factor that participates in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results provide insight into the role of XBP1 and the UPR in estrogen and antiestrogen responsiveness in breast cancer.
