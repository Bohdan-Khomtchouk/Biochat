TITLE
Extraocular and hindlimb skeletal muscle cell differentiation: time course (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell lines derived from extraocular (EOM) and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle allotypes at various time points up to 48 hours following induction of myogenesis. Results provide insight into the early developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of skeletal muscle classes.
