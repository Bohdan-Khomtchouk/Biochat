TITLE
microRNA-124 guide strand segmentation effect on HCT-116 Dicer hypomorph cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT-116 dicer- cells transfected with miR-124 duplex containing a segmented guide strand. Following miRNA guide strand segmentation, seed-based (positions 2 through 8 at the 5' end of the guide strand) activity persisted. Results illustrate a structural flexibility in miRNA duplexes.
