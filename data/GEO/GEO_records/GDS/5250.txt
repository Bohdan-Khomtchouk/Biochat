TITLE
Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) knockout effect on striatum

SUMMARY
Analysis of striatum from striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP)+/- and -/- littermates. Brain-specific tyrosine phosphatase STEP is associated with de-phosphorylation of several key neuronal signaling proteins. Results provide insight into role of STEP in synaptic plasticity.
