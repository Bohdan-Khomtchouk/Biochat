TITLE
Obese patients with and without type 2 diabetes: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver biopsies from 13 obese subjects (9 with type 2 diabetes, T2D). Hepatic lipid accumulation contributes to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms related to hepatic lipid accumulation in obese patients with or w/o T2D.
