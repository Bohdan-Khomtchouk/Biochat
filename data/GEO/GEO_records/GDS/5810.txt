TITLE
Hypoxia effect on von Hippel Lindau-overexpressing renal cell carcinoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 786-O cells transfected with von Hippel Lindau (VHL)-overexpression vector and cultured under hypoxia conditions (1% O2) for 24 hours. Results provide insight into overlap and differences of VHL- and hypoxia-dependent molecular alterations in RCC.
