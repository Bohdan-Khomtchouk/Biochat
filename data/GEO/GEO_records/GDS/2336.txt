TITLE
Caffeine effect on TOR complex 1 mutant: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of Tor1p mutant treated with up to 9 mM caffeine. Tor1p is a component of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), a regulator of growth in eukaryotic cells. I1954V and W2176R substitutions in Tor1p confer resistance to caffeine. Results provide insight into the function and activity of TORC1.
