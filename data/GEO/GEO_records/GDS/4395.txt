TITLE
External beam radiation therapy effect on prostate cancer patients: peripheral white blood cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood from men with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PC) on days 1, 7, 14, 21, 42 of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and at 30 days post-EBRT. Fatigue is a common side effect of EBRT. Results provide insight into molecular basis of fatigue in men with PC during EBRT.
