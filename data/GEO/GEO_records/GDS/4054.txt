TITLE
microRNA-221/222 knockdown effect on fulvestrant-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of fulvestrant-resistant MCF7 cells transfected with antisense miRNA inhibitors targeting miR-221 and miR-222. miR-221/222 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation in fulvestrant-resistant MCF7-F cells. Results provide insight into the role of miR-221/222 in acquired resistance to fulvestrant.
