TITLE
Fetal male and female whole gonads

SUMMARY
Comparison of male and female whole gonads at embryonic day 13 (E13). At E13, primordial germ cells enter mitotic arrest in male gonads and meiotic prophase in female X gonads. Results provide insight into the biological processes regulating early gonadal differentiation.
