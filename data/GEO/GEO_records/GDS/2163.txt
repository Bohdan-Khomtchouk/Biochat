TITLE
Paneth cell response to intestinal colonization

SUMMARY
Analysis of Paneth cells harvested by LCM from germ-free animals and previously germ-free animals reconstituted with normal intestinal flora. Paneth cells are key effectors of small intestinal antimicrobial defense. Results provide insight into how intestinal surfaces cope with microbial challenges.
