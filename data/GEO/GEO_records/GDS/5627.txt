TITLE
Dasatinib-resistant and dasatinib-sensitive pancreatic cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of dasatinib-resistant and dasatinib-sensitive PC cell lines. Dasatinib, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor, is FDA-approved for PC, but certain PC cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance to dasatinib. Results provide insight into molecular basis of dasatinib-resistance in PC cells.
