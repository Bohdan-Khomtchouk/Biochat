TITLE
IFN-gamma inflammatory effect on bronchial epithelial cells modulated by dexamethasone: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial epithelial cells treated with interferon (IFN) gamma, or dexamethasone (dex), or both. IFN-gamma plays a role in lung inflammatory responses and corticosteroids such as dex are used as treatments for inflammation. Cells examined 8 or 24 hours after treatment.
