TITLE
High-fat-diet model: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from obesity-prone (OP) Wistar males with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by a 16 week, high-fat diet (HFD). Obesity-resistant (OR) males, fed an identical diet, were also examined. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD pathogenesis.
