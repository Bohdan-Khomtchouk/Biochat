TITLE
Age effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells  from young and old C57BL/6s at 2 to 3 months and 22 to 24 months of age, respectively.  Results provide insight into the cellular and molecular changes underlying hematopoietic stem cell aging.
