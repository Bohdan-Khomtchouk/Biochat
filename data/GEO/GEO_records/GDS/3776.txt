TITLE
IKKbeta deletion effect on neutrophils

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ly6G+ thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal neutrophils from animals with inducible deletion of IKKbeta. Ikkbeta-delta neutrophils had a longer lifespan than did wild-type counterparts.  Results provide insight into the molecular basis of enhanced neutrophil lifespan in IKKbeta deficiency.
