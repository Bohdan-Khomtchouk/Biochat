TITLE
Uterus response to 17beta-estradiol: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri from overiectomized animals at various lengths of time up to 24 hours following treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the uterotrophic effect induced by a physiological dose of E2.
