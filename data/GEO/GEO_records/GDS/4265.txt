TITLE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in ex-smokers: sputum

SUMMARY
Analysis of sputum from ex-smokers with moderate (stage 2) or severe (stages 3, 4) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD). Induced sputum contains inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils and macrophages. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying COPD progression.
