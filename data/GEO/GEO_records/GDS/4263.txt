TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of composite bone marrow (BM) from healthy children and adults. Normal BM constitutes a complex tissue of blood progenitor cells changing in composition with age. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms associated with changes in the total precursor B-cell compartment with age.
