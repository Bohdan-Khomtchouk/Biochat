TITLE
High-density lipoproteins effect on pancreatic β cells subjected to apoptotic stimuli

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic β-TC3 insulinoma cell line subjected to serum deprivation in the presence of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the HDL protective effect on pancreatic β-cells in response to stress.
