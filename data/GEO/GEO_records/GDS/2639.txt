TITLE
Aging and cognitive impairment: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi from aged learning-impaired animals on the last day of training in the Morris water maze (MWZ) or 21 days post-training. The MWZ task is a dorsal hippocampal-dependent task. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of aging-related cognitive impairment.
