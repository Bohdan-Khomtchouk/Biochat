TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma target genes in aorta

SUMMARY
Analysis of aorta isolated from adult male C57BL/6J treated for 21 days with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone or vehicle. Diminished activity of PPARgamma may play role in pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular dysfunction.
