TITLE
Transcription factor DAF-19 deficient mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutants lacking DAF-19, a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in cilia function. Cilia defects are associated with a variety of human disorders, such as cystic kidney disease. Results provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate the formation and function of cilia.
