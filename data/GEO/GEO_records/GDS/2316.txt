TITLE
Gata4 heterozygous mutant heart response to pressure overload

SUMMARY
Analysis of pressure-overloaded (PO) heart ventricles of animals heterozygous for the second exon deletion of Gata4, a transcription factor. PO induced by transverse aortic constriction. Results provide insight into the role of Gata4 in the regulation of pathways necessary for cardiac hypertrophy.
