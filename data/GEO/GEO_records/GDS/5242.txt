TITLE
Interleukin-21 effect on STAT3-deficient naïve B cells from autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of naïve B cells purified from peripheral blood of AD-HIES patients with STAT3 loss-of-function mutation and then cultured with CD40 ligand alone or together with interleukin-21. Results provide insight into IL-21R/STAT3 signaling induced genes underlying naïve B cell differentiation.
