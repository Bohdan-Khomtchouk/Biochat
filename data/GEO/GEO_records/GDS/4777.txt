TITLE
Freshly-isolated and cultured arterial and venous endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of freshly-isolated endothelial cells (EC) from umbilical arteries and veins and cultured arterial and venous ECs from different vascular regions. Culturing leads to loss of the arterial phenotype. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying arteriovenous EC heterogeneity.
