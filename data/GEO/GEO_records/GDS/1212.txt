TITLE
Tumor necrosis factor effect in the absence of NF-kappaB activity: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  on gene expression in HeLa cells with NF-kappaB inactivated. NF-kappaB inactivated with 2 ug/ml doxycycline. Cells examined at various time points following stimulation with 25 ng/ml TNF. Results identify potential targets of NF-kappaB.
