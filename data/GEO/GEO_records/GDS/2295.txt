TITLE
Aplidin and cytarabine effect on diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma SKI-DLCL cells treated with Aplidin, cytarabine (AraC), or both anticancer drugs. The effect of the drugs on animals with SKI-DLCL cell-derived tumors also examined. Results provide insight into the action of Aplidin alone and in combination with AraC.
