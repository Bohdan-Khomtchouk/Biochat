TITLE
Cancer stem cell population in highly metastatic variants of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD24-/CD44+/ESA+ cancer stem cells from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (BC) cell line and its highly metastatic variants 231BoM-1833 and 231BrM-2a. The majority of BC deaths are attributed to metastatic disease. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of metastatic progression.
