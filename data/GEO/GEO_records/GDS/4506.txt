TITLE
Liver response to obesity and fasting

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated polysomes from leptin deficient (ob/ob) males after overnight fasting. The liver is critical for metabolic homeostasis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying changes in protein metabolism caused by obesity and diabetes.
