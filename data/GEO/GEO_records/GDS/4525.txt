TITLE
Aortic endothelial cell response to very high wall shear stress

SUMMARY
Analysis of aortic endothelial cells (EC) exposed to high wall shear stress (WSS) for 24hr in an in vitro flow loop system. High WSS often induces expansive remodeling of the artery. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive remodeling under high WSS conditions.
