TITLE
Methylmalonic acidemia-associated renal disease model: kidney

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney from methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Mut)-deficient females that express Mut in hepatocytes under the control of an albumin promoter. This animal model replicates methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) kidney disease. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying MMA renal disease.
