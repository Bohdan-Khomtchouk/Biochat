TITLE
Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy effect on interleukin-18 null hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of left ventricles of interleukin (IL)-18 null mutants following surgical transaortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac hypertrophy (LVH) by pressure overload. IL-18 is a cardiotropic proinflammatory cytokine. Results provide insight into the role of IL-18 in the hypertrophic response.
