TITLE
ROR alpha1 deletion effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle (SM) from transgenics deficient in retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) alpha 1delDE. SM accounts for significant levels of lipid catabolism; ROR alpha is involved in regulating lipid metabolism. Results provide insight into ROR alpha1 signaling in SM.
