TITLE
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to Lassa Virus and Mopeia/Lassa reassortant 29: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs exposed in vitro to LASV or ML29 viruses and collected up to 24 hrs post-exposure. The ML29 vaccine candidate is derived from Lassa and Mopeia viruses and protects against Lassa fever disease. Results provide insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanisms of attenuation.
