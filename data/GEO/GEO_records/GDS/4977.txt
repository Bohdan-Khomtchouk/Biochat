TITLE
Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma and T Cell/Histiocyte Rich Large B Cell Lymphoma: microdissected tumor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of tumor cells microdissected from frozen sections of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), T cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL), and THRLBCL-like NLPHL. Results provide insight into the molecular relatedness of the lymphoma entities.
