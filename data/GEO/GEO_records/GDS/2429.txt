TITLE
Monocyte differentiation to macrophage and subsequent polarization (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes (MCs) treated with M-CSF to induce differentiation into macrophages (MPs), and mature MPs treated with either IFN-gamma and LPS or IL-4 to induce polarization to M1 or M2 cells, respectively. Results provide insight into MC to MP differentiation and polarized activation.
