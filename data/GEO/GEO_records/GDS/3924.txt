TITLE
Image defocus effect on retina/retinal pigment epithelium: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from 1 week-old chicks wearing a unilateral spectacle lens of + or 15 diopters for 6 hours or 3 days.  The spectacle lens induces refractive errors. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying refractive development.
