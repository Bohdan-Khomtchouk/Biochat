TITLE
Obstructive sleep apnea response to continuous positive airway pressure treatment: leukocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Results provide insight into the system-wide molecular response of OSA patients to CPAP therapy.
