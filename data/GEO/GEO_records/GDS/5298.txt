TITLE
miR-28 expression effect on Burkitt lymphoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of P3HR1 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells expressing miR-28 for 12 and 24 hours. BL is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. miR-28 is downregulated in BL. Results provide insight into the role of miR-28 in the pathogenesis of BL.
