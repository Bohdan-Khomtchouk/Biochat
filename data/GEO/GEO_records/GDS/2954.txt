TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived lipopeptide effect on monocytes and dendritic cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes (MOs) and MO-derived dendritic cells (DCs) for up to 24 hours following Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived lipopeptide treatment. Toll-like receptor activation by bacterial lipopeptides reduced the viability of M. tuberculosis in MOs and macrophages but not MO-derived DCs.
