TITLE
Hypoxia effect on HL-1 cardiomyocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia for 8 hrs. Accumulation of triglycerides in the myocardium occurs under reduced O2 conditions and is associated with impaired cardiac function. Results provide insight into molecular basis of lipid accumulation in heart under hypoxic conditions.
