TITLE
Various bone marrow hematopoietic cell fractions

SUMMARY
Analysis of BM hematopoietic cell fractions including CD34-KSL hematopoietic stem cells. HSCs are primitive cells capable of both self-renewal and differentiating into all of the mature blood cell lineages. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying maintenance of HSC self-renewal.
