TITLE
MyD88 and TRIF deficient spleen response to septic peritonitis

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleens of MyD88 and TRIF double null mutants following surgical induction of septic peritonitis. MyD88 and TRIF are involved in innate immune responses that combat bacterial infections. Results provide insight into the role of MyD88 and TRIF in the pathogenesis of septic peritonitis.
