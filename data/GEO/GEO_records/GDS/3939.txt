TITLE
Fisher 344 rat model of aging: parietal cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of parietal cortices of young and aged F344 males implanted with telemetry devices to measure sleep architecture. Animals were trained in the Morris water maze to assess cognitive function. Results provide insight into possible mechanistic links between sleep changes and cognitive aging.
