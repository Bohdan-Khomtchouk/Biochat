TITLE
Caveolin-3 deficiency effect on virgin mammary glands

SUMMARY
Analysis of caveolin-3 (Cav-3) deficient mammary glands from virgin females. Cav-3 deficient virgin mammary glands develop lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this Cav-3 null phenotype.
