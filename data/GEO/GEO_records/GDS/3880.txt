TITLE
Prolonged exercise training effect on skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetes subjects

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies from insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects before/after exercise training, pre-diabetics and healthy controls. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of T2D, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the effects of prolonged exercise training.
