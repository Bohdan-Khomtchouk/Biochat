TITLE
T-dependent and T-independent germinal center B cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of T-dependent (TD) and T-independent (TI) germinal center B cells from animals 4 days after immunization. The TD animals were carrier-primed 5 weeks earlier so that T-cell help was not limiting. Results provide insight into molecular differences between TD and TI germinal center B cells.
