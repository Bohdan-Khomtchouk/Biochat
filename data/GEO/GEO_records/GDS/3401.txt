TITLE
Two distinct isogenic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell populations from umbilical cord blood (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Comparison of UCB1 and UCB2 cells, two distinct isogenic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) populations isolated from umbilical cord blood. UCB1 and UCB2 display phenotypic differences. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the phenotypic heterogeneity among MSC populations.
