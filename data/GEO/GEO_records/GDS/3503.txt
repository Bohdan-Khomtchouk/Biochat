TITLE
Endothelial progenitor cell response to exercise

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 12 healthy subjects at baseline and after 3 months of exercise, then cultured for the endothelial progenitor cell-colony forming units (EPC-CFUs) assay. Results provide insight into EPC phenotype and relevance to endothelial function.
