TITLE
Acute ethanol administration effect on Toll-like receptor 3 signaling in macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of peritoneal macrophages from 8 to12 week-old C57BL/6xC3H females treated with 100 ug poly(I:C) and 6 g/kg ethanol.  Poly(I:C) mimics viral dsRNA by binding Toll-like receptor 3.  Results provide insight into the suppression of innate immunity by ethanol.
