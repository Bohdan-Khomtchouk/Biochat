TITLE
Quinine effect on yeast eukaryotic model

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells subjected to anti-malaria drug quinine (QN) at concentration that exerted a very slight effect on cellular growth. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying QN action and the host response to the drug.
