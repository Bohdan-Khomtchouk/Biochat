TITLE
KRAP deficiency effect on brown adipose tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown adipose tissues from animals lacking KRAP. KRAP null mutants exhibit increased metabolic rate, reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia, and hypoleptinemia. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the metabolic phenotype of KRAP deficient animals.
