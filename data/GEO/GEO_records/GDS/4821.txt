TITLE
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-driven pediatric glioblastoma model with p53 null background

SUMMARY
Analysis of high-grade gliomas (HGG) driven by intracranial implantation of p53-null astrocytes expressing any of 6 different mutant forms of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα) found in pediatric HGGs. Results provide insight into the role of PDGFRα mutations in pediatric HGGs.
