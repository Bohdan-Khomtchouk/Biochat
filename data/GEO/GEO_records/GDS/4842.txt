TITLE
SARM-deficient brain response to vesicular stomatitis virus infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of brains from SARM-deficient animals infected with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). SARM is a member of the Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor family. VSV is used to study the response to neurotropic viral infections. Results provide insight into the role of SARM in innate immunity.
