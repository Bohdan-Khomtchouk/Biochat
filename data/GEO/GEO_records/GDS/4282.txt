TITLE
Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma tumors and tumorgrafts deficient for tumor suppressor BAP1 or PBRM1

SUMMARY
Analysis of BAP1- and PBRM1-deficient ccRCC primary tumors, tumors growing in immunodeficient mice (tumorgrafts), and matched normal kidney cortices. BAP1 loss, but not PBRM1 loss, is associated with high-grade tumors. Results provide insight into molecular classification of RCC subtypes.
