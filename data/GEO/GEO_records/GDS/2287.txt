TITLE
Airway epithelial cell response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa rsmA mutant infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of airway epithelial cells infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 or the rsmA mutant. RsmA is a small RNA-binding protein that plays a role in the regulation of virulence-related genes in P. aeruginosa. Results provide insight into the influence of RsmA-regulated functions on the host.
