TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast response to overexpression of combinatorial transcription factor modules

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transduced with various combinations of transcription factors (TFs) shown to play a role in developmental cardiogenesis. Results provide insight into cardio-inducing capacity of the TFs to actuate cellular reprogramming of MEFs into cardiomyocyte-like cells.
