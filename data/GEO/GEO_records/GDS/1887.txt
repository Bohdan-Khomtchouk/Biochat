TITLE
Rectal cancer cells and radiotherapy response

SUMMARY
Analysis of rectal cancer cells from patients prior to preoperative radiotherapy. Response to radiotherapy determined by histopathologic examination of resected specimens. Results identify gene markers for the characterization and prediction of the response to radiotherapy in rectal cancer.
