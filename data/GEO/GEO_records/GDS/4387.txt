TITLE
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated acute liver failure (ALF) patients: liver explant

SUMMARY
Analysis of explanted livers of 4 patients with HBV-associated ALF who underwent liver transplantation. Liver has inherent regenerative capacity via hepatic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) when hepatic loss is massive. Results provide insight into role of HSPC in liver regeneration associated with ALF.
