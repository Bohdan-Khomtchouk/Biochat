TITLE
Candida albicans DAY185 infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of N2 young adults after 4hr exposure to live or heat-killed C. albicans DAY185. C. albicans hyphae can kill C. elegans in a manner modeling key aspects of mammalian pathogenesis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying host immune response to C. albicans infection.

ORGANISM
