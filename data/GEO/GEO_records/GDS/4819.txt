TITLE
Inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme MLN4924 effect on melanoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of A375 melanoma cells treated with small molecule MLN4924 for up to 24 hrs. MLN4924 selectively inhibits Nedd8-activating enzyme resulting in inactivation of the entire family of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of MLN4924-induced cell death.
