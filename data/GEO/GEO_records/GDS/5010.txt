TITLE
N-nitrosodiethylamine effect on high mobility group N 1 chromosomal protein-deficient liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from Hmgn1-/- mutants injected with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN). HMGN1 is a nucleosome-binding protein affecting chromatin structure/function. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying accelerated progression of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in HMGN1 mutants.
