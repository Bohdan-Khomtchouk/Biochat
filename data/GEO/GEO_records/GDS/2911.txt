TITLE
Huntington's disease models

SUMMARY
Comparison of striatal cells harboring a mutant huntingtin protein with 111 glutamines to wild type striatal cells treated with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). The size of the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin is correlated with mitochondrial function. 3-NP is a respiratory chain inhibitor.
