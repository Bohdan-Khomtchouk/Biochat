TITLE
Cardiac hypertrophy and phosphoinositide 3-kinase

Analysis of the relationship between cardiac hypertrophy/cell size regulation with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Constitutively active (caPI3K - hearts 20% larger) and dominant-negative (dnPI3K - hearts 17% smaller) mice examined.
