TITLE
Mixed lineage leukemia fusion protein induction of acute leukemia: bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow of C57BL6 mice injected with AAF4.MLL-transduced or AF4.MLL/MLL.AF4-transduced leukemic cells. MLL fusion proteins initiate malignant transformation leading to the development of acute leukemia. Results provide insight into the leukemogenic properties of MLL fusion proteins.
