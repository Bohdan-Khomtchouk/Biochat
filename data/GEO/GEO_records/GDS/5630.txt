TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide effect on superoxide dismutase 1-deficient yeast cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of superoxide dismutase 1 deficient cells treated with reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 20 minutes. Sod1 deletion in yeast is known to cause extensive oxidative damage. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Sod1â€™s role in oxidative stress resistance.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
