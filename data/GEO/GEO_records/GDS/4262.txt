TITLE
Oxidized low-density lipoprotein effect on LOX-1 overexpressing aortic endothelial cell line HAECT: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1)-overexpressing HAECT cells treated with OxLDL for up to 24 hrs. OxLDL is implicated as a proatherogenic factor. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying OxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.
