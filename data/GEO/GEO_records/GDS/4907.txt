TITLE
Postinfarction heart failure model: left ventricle

SUMMARY
Analysis of LV from males subjected to left coronary artery ligation to induce large, moderate, or small myocardial infarctions (MI). Only animals with large MIs develop LV remodeling and heart failure (HF). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the progression of LV remodeling and HF.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
