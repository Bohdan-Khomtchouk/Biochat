TITLE
Hippocampus response to high-frequency stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of males subjected to ventrolateral (VL) thalamus high-frequency stimulation (HFS). HFS of the VL thalami is used to treat the resting tremor of Parkinson's disease, a disorder that involves the neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra and brain areas such as the hippocampus.
