TITLE
CD43+/41+/235+ iPSC-derived progenitor cells with germ-line trisomy 21

SUMMARY
Analysis of sorted CD43+/41+/235+ progenitors generated from trisomy 21 (T21) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) affects many tissues, including blood, particularly during embryogenesis. Results provide insight into T21 effect on embryonic hematopoiesis.
