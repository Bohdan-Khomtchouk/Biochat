TITLE
Clock neuron function destruction effect on the head

SUMMARY
Analysis of heads of transgenics expressing a polyglutamine-expanded neurotoxin in the major timeless (tim)-expressing cells of the adult brain. tim is a clock gene. Results provide insight into the effect of the complete absence of clock-neuron function on behavior and molecular phenotypes.
