TITLE
Inherited dilated cardiomyopathy patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of iPSCs derived from skin fibroblasts of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) family members carrying point mutation R173W in the sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) gene. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying familial dilated cardiomyopathy.
