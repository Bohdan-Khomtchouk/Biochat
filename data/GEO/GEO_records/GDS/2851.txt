TITLE
Brain trauma model: time course (RG-U34A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain at various time points up to 21 days following lateral fluid percussion-induced brain injury.  Delayed cell death following trauma results in brain damage. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying brain damage after traumatic injury.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
GPL85 : [RG_U34A] Affymetrix Rat Genome U34 Array
