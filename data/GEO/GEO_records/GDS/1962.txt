TITLE
Glioma-derived stem cell factor effect on angiogenesis in the brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of gliomas of different grades. Stem cell factor (SCF) is overexpressed by glioma cells but its role in gliomagenesis has been unclear. Results identify a positive correlation of SCF expression with increasing glioma grade which supports a role for SCF in tumor angiogenesis in the brain.
