TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-γ coactivator-1α deficiency effect on aged gastrocnemius muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscle from aged animals with muscle-specific Pgc-1α depletion. PGC-1alpha is a transcriptional coactivator of the mitochondrial gene program. Results provide insight into the role of Pgc-1α in the glucose intolerance and chronic systemic inflammation associated with aging.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
