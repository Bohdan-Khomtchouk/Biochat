TITLE
Long-term heat-stress effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle from eight healthy men following a 10-week application of heat stress (8 hours/day, 4 days/week) on the quadriceps muscles without exercise training. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the muscular adaptation to heat stress.
