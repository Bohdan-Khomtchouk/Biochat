TITLE
Interstrain differences in the liver effects of trichloroethylene

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from multiple inbred strains 24hr after trichloroethylene (TCE) treatment. TCE is a widely used industrial chemical and a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying  interstrain differences in liver effects of TCE.
