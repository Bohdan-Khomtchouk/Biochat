TITLE
Dioxin exposure in utero effect on the pituitary gland at maturity

SUMMARY
Analysis of pituitary glands of postnatal day 70 male rats exposed in utero to dioxin at gestational day 15. Rats exposed to dioxin in utero exhibit a reduced pituitary synthesis of luteinizing hormone at the late fetal and early postnatal period, leading to defects in sexual behavior at adulthood.
