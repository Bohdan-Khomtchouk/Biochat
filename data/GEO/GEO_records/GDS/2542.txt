TITLE
Heart failure in obesity model

SUMMARY
Analysis of left heart ventricles of 4 and 10-month old SHHF obese animals homozygous for leptin receptor (ObR) mutation. This mutant is obese at 4 months of age and prone to heart failure after 14 months. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the contribution of obesity to heart failure.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
