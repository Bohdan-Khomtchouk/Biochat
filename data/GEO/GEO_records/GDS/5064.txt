TITLE
Neuroserpin G392E mutant expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells expressing the G392E mutant of neuroserpin. Accumulation of mutant neuroserpin polymers in the ER is associated with familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. Results provide insight into pathways initiated by the polymerization of neuroserpin within the ER.
