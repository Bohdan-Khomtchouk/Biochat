TITLE
Leaf response to paraquat: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ler ecotype rosette leaves for up to 4 hours following treatment with paraquat. Paraquat is an herbicide that acts as a terminal oxidant of photosystem I. In light paraquat reduces oxygen to the superoxide radical, which subsequently dismutates to hydrogen peroxide.
