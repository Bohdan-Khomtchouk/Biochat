TITLE
P19CL6 cardiogenic embryonal carcinoma cell differentiation into a cardiac lineage: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of P19CL6 cells induced to differentiate into a cardiac lineage in the presence of DMSO. These results, together with results from E10.5 second heart field (SHF)-containing pharyngeal arch and E12.5 heart, provide insight into Nkx2.5 target genes relevant specifically to SHF.

ORGANISM
