TITLE
Supplementary dietary calcium effect on small-intestinal mucosal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of small intestine (proximal, middle, distal) mucosal cells of C57BL/6J males fed high-fat diets differing in Ca concentration. High-Ca (150mmol/kg) stimulates fecal fat and bile acid excretion. Results provide insight into role of dietary Ca on development of obesity or insulin resistance.
