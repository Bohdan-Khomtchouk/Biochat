TITLE
Regulatory T cell ablation effect on BDC2.5/NOD pancreatic or splenic natural killer cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of natural killer (NK) cells isolated from the pancreas or spleen of BDC2.5/NOD.Foxp3DTR animals up to 24 hours after diphtheria toxin (DT) injection to ablate regulatory T (Treg) cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Treg/NK cross-talk in controlling diabetes.
