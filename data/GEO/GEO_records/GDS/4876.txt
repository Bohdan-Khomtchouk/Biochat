TITLE
Pulmonary surfactant protein-C deficiency effect on alveolar type II epithelial cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) from mutants deficient for surfactant protein-C (SP-C). SP-C is a surfactant-associated protein secreted by AEC II cells. Results provide insight into the basis of the progressive lung inflammation and remodeling observed in SP-C null mutants.
