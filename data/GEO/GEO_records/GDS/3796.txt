TITLE
Alkylphospholipids effect on HaCaT keratinocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of HaCaT keratinocytes treated with alkylphospholipids (APLs) Ino-C2-PAF, Glc-PAF, and edelfosine. APLs interfere with a variety of key enzymes implicated in cell growth, motility, invasion, and apoptosis. Results provide insight into mechanism of action of APLs.
