TITLE
Cell lines derived from metastatic lung adenocarcinoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of KrasG12D;p53-/- cell lines derived from primary lung tumors or from metastases (liver, lymph node). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in extracellular matrix (ECM)-adhesion in metastatic progression.
