TITLE
Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity with lymph node metastasis

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 18 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity with or without lymph node metastasis. Expression in lymph node metastasis also examined. Results used to identify gene expression signature in primary tumors that indicates the presence of lymph node metastasis.
