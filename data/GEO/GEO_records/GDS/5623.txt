TITLE
Interferon-gamma effect on lipopolysaccharide-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of BMDMs primed with IFNγ and subsequently activated with LPS. Pro-inflammatory macrophages are induced by the Th1 cytokine IFNγ and/or the toll-like receptor ligand LPS. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of IFNγ priming on LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages.
