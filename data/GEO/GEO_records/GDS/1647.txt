TITLE
RPE65 null mutant model of Leber's congenital amaurosis

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas of RPE65 null mutants at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. RPE65 is highly expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Mutations in REP65 cause 10-15% of Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) cases, a severe form of retinal dystrophy. Results provide insight into early LCA progression.
