TITLE
Various central nervous system regions of adult inbred strain

SUMMARY
Analysis of 51 regions with distinct functions in the central nervous system (CNS) microdissected from 7 to 8 week-old Balb/c males. Each region sampled every 4 h for 24 h then pooled. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying distinct functional regions in the adult brain.
