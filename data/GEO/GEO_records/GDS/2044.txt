TITLE
DNA demethylation effect on dermal fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary dermal fibroblasts treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) for 96 hours. This study seeks to identify developmental regulator genes whose expression in terminally differentiated cells is inhibited by DNA methylation.
