TITLE
Lung response to urban particulate matter: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from hypersensitive males exposed to urban particulate matter.  Males exposed to 10 mg Ottawa dust sample EHC-93 per kg of body weight.  Lungs examined at various time points up to 40 hours after exposure.  Results provide insight into the molecular effects of exposure to dust.
