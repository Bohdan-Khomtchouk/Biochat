TITLE
Selenate effect on shoots

SUMMARY
Analysis of shoots from 10-day-old plants grown with selenate, the major form of bioavailable selenium (Se) in soil. Plants have the capacity to attenuate the toxic effects of Se.  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Se-stress responses and Se tolerance mechanisms in plants.
