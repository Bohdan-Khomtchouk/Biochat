TITLE
Epidermal stem cell and transit-amplifying cell (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of cDNA libraries each generated from a single cultured epidermal stem cell (SC) or transit-amplifying (TA) cell. TA cells are SC progenies that are destined to terminally differentiate. Single cell expression profiling avoids the problem of potentially masking cellular heterogeneity.
