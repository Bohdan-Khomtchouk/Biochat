TITLE
High temperature adapted strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3 strains derived by growing the ancestral Bc251 strain for 2,000 generations at 41.5 degrees C. Cells grown to mid log-phase at 41.5 degrees C. Results provide insight into the role of heat-inducible genes in the genetic adaptation to long-term temperature stress.
