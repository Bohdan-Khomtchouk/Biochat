TITLE
Zinc finger transcription factor Fezf1 deficiency effect on main olfactory epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of E.18 olfactory cells lacking Fezf1, a zinc finger transcription factor. Olfactory cells isolated from the main olfactory epithelium. Results provide insight into the role of Fezf1 in olfactory system development and sensory neuron identity.
