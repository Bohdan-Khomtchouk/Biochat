TITLE
Organophosphorus compound VX effect on hepatocytes: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of hNHEPS hepatocytes exposed to sublethal concentrations (up to 10Î¼M) of the highly toxic organophosphorus (OP) compound VX (O-ethyl S-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothiolate). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying OP-induced hepatotoxicity.
