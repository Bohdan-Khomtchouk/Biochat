TITLE
Irradiation effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from C57Bl6 females exposed to a low, intermediate, or lethal dose of total body irradiation. Results used to define gene expression signatures for exposure to different doses of radiation.
