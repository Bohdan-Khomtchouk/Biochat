TITLE
Diesel exhaust inhalation effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals exposed to diesel exhaust (DE), a major source of urban fine particulate matter (FPM). Exposure to ambient FPM is associated with cardiovascular disease. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying such health effects.
