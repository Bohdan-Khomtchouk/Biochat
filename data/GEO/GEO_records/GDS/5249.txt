TITLE
Bicaudal C homolog 1 knock down effect in primary calvarial osteoblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of calvarial osteoblasts transfected with siRNAs targeting bicaudal C homolog 1 (constructs BICC1_1, BICC1_2 and BICC1_3). Bicc1 encodes an RNA-binding protein. Results provide insight into the role of Bicc in osteoblastogenesis.
