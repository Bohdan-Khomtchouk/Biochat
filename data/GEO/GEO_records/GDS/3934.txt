TITLE
Suspension cell cultures response to overexpression of master regulators VND6 and SND1

SUMMARY
Analysis of suspension cell lines in which VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN6 (VND6) or SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATES NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1) was overexpressed after the addition of estrogen. Results provide insight in to the roles of master regulators VND6 and SND1 in xylem development.
