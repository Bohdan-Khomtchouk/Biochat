TITLE
Increased cell membrane saturated fatty acid effect on Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Analysis of Escherichia coli cells treated with CHIR-090, an inhibitor of lipid A bioynthesis, to increase the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (SFA:UFA) in the cell membrane. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms regulating membrane lipid homeostasis in E. coli.
