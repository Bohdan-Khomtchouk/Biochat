TITLE
Intestinal epithelium response to ursodeoxycholic acid

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal colon epithelium of C57BL/6J females fed a standard diet containing 0.4% ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). UDCA mitigates colon carcinogenesis in humans and in animal models. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticarcinogenic action of UDCA.
