TITLE
GATA-3 deficiency effect on regulatory T cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of regulatory T (Treg) cells from mutants deficient for the transcription factor GATA-3. GATA-3 forms a complex with the transcription factor Fox3p, essential in the function of Treg cells. Results provide insight into the role of GATA-3 in the regulation of the Treg transcriptome.
