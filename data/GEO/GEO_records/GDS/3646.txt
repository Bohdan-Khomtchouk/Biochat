TITLE
Celiac disease: primary leukocytes

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of untouched primary leukocytes from unrelated celiac disease individuals. Results used in conjunction with genome-wide association genotype data provide insight into genetic variation effects on gene expression in primary leukocytes from an immune-mediated disease.
