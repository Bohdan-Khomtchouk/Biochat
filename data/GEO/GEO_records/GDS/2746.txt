TITLE
Lmna H222P homozygous and heterozygous mutant models of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: hearts

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of A-type lamin Lmna H222P homo-/heterozygous mutants. LMNA mutations lead to autosomal dominant and recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy. Results provide insight into the role of LMNA in the development of cardiomyopathy.
