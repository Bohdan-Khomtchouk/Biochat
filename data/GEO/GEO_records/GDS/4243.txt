TITLE
Host immune response of bacterial infected nematode stimulated with small molecule

SUMMARY
Analysis of bacterial infected C. elegans treated with 70 μM RPW-24 or DMSO. In a C.elegans-bacterial infection assay screening small molecules, RPW-24 was identified as a putative antimicrobial agent. Results provide insight into C. elegans conserved immune response to bacterial infection.
