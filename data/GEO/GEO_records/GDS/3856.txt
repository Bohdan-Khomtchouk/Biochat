TITLE
Oral mucosal fibroblast response to artificial wounding stimulus

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of oral mucosal (OM) fibroblasts and patient-matched skin fibroblasts following serum starvation/induction. OM fibroblasts exhibit a preferential wound-healing response compared to that of dermis. Results provide insight into molecular basis of OM fibroblast wound healing response.
