TITLE
CA1 and CA3 hippocampal slice cultures response to oxidative stress: time course

SUMMARY
Anlaysis of CA1 and CA3 hippocampal slice cultures for up to 12 hours following treatment with duroquinone to induce oxidative stress (OS). Neurons in the CA1 region are sensitive to OS, while those in CA3 are resistant. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this difference.
