TITLE
Transcription factor OTX2 oncogene silencing effect on D425 medulloblastoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of D425 medulloblastoma (MB) cells with doxycyline inducible shRNA against OTX2, sampled 0 to 96 hrs after induction in 3 independent time courses (TC). OTX2 is implicated as an oncogene in childhood MB. Results provide insight into role of OTX2 in medulloblastoma.
