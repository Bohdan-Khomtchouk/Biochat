TITLE
Polybrominated diphenyl ether effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers collected from postnatal day (PND) 22 and 13-week-old Wistar/Han rats exposed in utero to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and directly dosed with PBDE. PBDEs are flame retardants. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PBDE toxicities.
