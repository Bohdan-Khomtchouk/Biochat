TITLE
Ls174T colon cancer cell line response to Wnt signaling inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ls174T colon cancer cells following doxycyclin-induction of a dominant-negative Tcf4 transgene, or a shRNA against β-catenin, to block the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms downstream of a defined signal transduction pathway.
