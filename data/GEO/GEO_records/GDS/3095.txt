TITLE
Zinc effect on malignant and non-malignant prostate cell lines: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of malignant PC-3 and non-malignant HPR-1 prostate cells treated for up to 6 hours with zinc. Zinc exposure induces apoptosis in PC-3 cells, but not in HPR-1 cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying zinc-induced prostatic cell apoptosis.
