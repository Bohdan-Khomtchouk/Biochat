TITLE
Newly diagnosed and chronic pediatric immune thrombocytopenia: peripheral blood T-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-cells from children with newly diagnosed ITP and children with chronic ITP. ITP is an autoimmune disease that resolves in the majority of children but becomes chronic in others.  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the newly diagnosed and chronic phases of ITP.
