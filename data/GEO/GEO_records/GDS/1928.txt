TITLE
Compensated and decompensated right ventricular hypertrophy at onset: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of right ventricles at the onset of compensated or decompensated right ventricular hypertrophy. Compensated and decompensated phenotypes induced by injection with 30 and 80 mg/kg monocrotaline, respectively. Results identify potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
