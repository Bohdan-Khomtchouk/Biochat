TITLE
Pancreatic-specific PPAR-beta deletion effect on pancreatic beta-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of β-cells harboring a pancreatic-specific deletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-β. The pancreas-specific KO animals developed chronic hyperinsulinemia due to increased beta-cell mass and insulin secretion. Results provide insight into role of PPAR-β in pancreas.
