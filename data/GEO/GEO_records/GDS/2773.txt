TITLE
Endothelial cell response to chronic activation by tumor necrosis factor

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial cells acutely activated by treatment with soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or chronically activated by expression of an uncleavable form of the transmembrane TNF precursor. Results provide insight into the mechanisms mediating the effect of chronic endothelial activation.
