TITLE
Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 gamma delta T cells response to non-TCR agonist  stimulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of Vdelta1 (Vd1) and Vdelta2 (Vd2) gamma delta (gd) T cells following stimulation with a non-TCR mediated agonist, PMA/ionomycin. Vd1 and Vd2 cells differ in tissue tropism, TCR usage, and agonist response. Results provide insight into the functional differences between Vd1 and Vd2 cells.
