TITLE
Mechanical strain effect on fetal lung type II epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic day 19 fetal lung type II epithelial cells exposed to mechanical strain for 16 hours. Mechanical forces are essential for normal fetal lung development. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating lung development in response to mechanical forces.
