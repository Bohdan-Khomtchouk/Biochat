TITLE
Keratinocyte stem cellâ€“enriched hair follicle bulge cells

SUMMARY
Comparison of outer root sheath (ORS) cells of the hair follicle bulge with other defined ORS cell subpopulations within the follicle. Results provide insight into the biological distinctiveness of hair follicle bulge cells, suggesting the bulge is a repository for keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs).
