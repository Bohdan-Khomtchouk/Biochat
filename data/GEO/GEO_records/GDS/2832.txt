TITLE
Sphingosine-1-phosphate effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) after treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which plays a role in regulation of fate in many cell types. ESCs grown on mouse embryo fibroblast feeder cells and under feeder-free conditions. Results provide insight into the role of S1P in ESC renewal.
