TITLE
Melanoma cell lines treated with a DNA methylase inhibitor

SUMMARY
Analysis of a poorly tumorigenic melanoma cell line and its 3 highly aggressive derivative lines after treatment with 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Results suggest multiple markers for melanoma progression that are regulated by DNA methylation.
