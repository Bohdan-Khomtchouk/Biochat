TITLE
Transcription factor Klf5 deficiency effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking the transcription factor Klf5. Klf5 deficiency results in the failure of ESC derivation from cells of the inner cell mass and early embryonic lethality. Results provide insight into the role of Klf5 in blastocyst development and ESC self-renewal.
