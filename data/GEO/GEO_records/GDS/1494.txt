TITLE
RyhB small regulatory RNA effect on global iron use

SUMMARY
Analysis of derivatives of strain MG1655: wild-type, fur mutant, and wild-type with added FeSO4, induced to overexpress RyhB. RyhB is a noncoding RNA regulated by the Fur repressor protein. Results suggest that RyhB plays a major role in the regulation of iron metabolism.
