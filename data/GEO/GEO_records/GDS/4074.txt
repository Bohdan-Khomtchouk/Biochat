TITLE
Zinc finger transcription factor induced fulvestrant resistant MCF7-R73 breast cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7-R73 cells retrovirally induced with various zinc finger transcription factors. Six unique ZF-TFs conferred stable fulvestrant-resistance. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying acquired fulvestrant-resistance in breast cancer cells.
