TITLE
Fibroblast adipogenesis induced by EBF-1 and PPARgamma2 overexpression: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of NIH-3T3 embryonic fibroblasts induced to differentiate into adipocytes by overexpression of early B cell factor (EBF)-1 or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma2 transcription factors. Cells examined at various time points up to 10 days following overexpression.

ORGANISM
