TITLE
EphB2-selected populations of intestinal crypt cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal epithelial cells FACS-sorted according to high, medium or low EphB2 receptor levels. Intestinal stem cells (ISC) highly express EphB2 receptor which becomes gradually silenced as cells differentiate. Results provide insight into a molecular program specific for normal ISCs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
