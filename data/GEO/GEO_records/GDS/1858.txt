TITLE
Various miRNA transfections: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells at 12 or 24 hours after transfection with wild type or mutant miR-1 or miR-124. miR-1 is preferentially expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, while miR-124 is preferentially expressed in brain. Results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of target transcripts.
