TITLE
Thymocytes of the NOD background response to activation by a mimotope peptide

SUMMARY
Analysis of NOD or B6g7 strain BDC2.5 transgenic fetal thymic organ culture thymocytes after addition of a mimotope peptide that activates mature BDC2.5 T cells to inititate apoptosis. Results provide insight into the differential sensitivity to clonal deletion of this clonotype in the 2 strains.
