TITLE
Effect of host quantitative resistance during Phytophthora sojae infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypocotyls from 8 cultivars, varying in quantitative resistance, up to 120 hours following infection with oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae. Mock inoculations spiked with 2-16% P. sojae RNA. Results identify host and pathogen genes differentially expressed during P. sojae infection.
