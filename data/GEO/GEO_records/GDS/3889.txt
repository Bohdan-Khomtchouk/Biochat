TITLE
Hematopoietic CD34+ cells exposed in vitro to dioxin

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cells from 5 healthy donors (3 paired samples) before and after in vitro 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways of TCDD-induced hematopoietic progenitor cell impairment in bone marrow.
