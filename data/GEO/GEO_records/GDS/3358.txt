TITLE
Androgen deprivation effect on LNCaP prostate cancer cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured LNCaP prostate cancer cells during 12 months of androgen deprivation. Following androgen ablation therapy, most prostate cancer patients develop treatment resistance. Results provide insight into prostate cancer cell survival and androgen-independence.
