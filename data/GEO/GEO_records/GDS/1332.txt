TITLE
Huntington's disease: peripheral blood expression profile (Codelink Uniset 20K)

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood samples of 5 presymptomatic and 12 symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD) patients. Studies suggest that gene expression may be altered in a variety of tissues in HD, including peripheral blood. Results identify potential markers for HD.
