TITLE
Cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 biofilms

SUMMARY
Analysis of cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchial epithelial CFBE41o- cells exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 biofilms. Cells overexpressing 508del-CFTR and cells rescued with wild type CFTR were examined. CFTR mutations enhance the inflammatory response in the lung to PA01 infection.
