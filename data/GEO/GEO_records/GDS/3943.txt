TITLE
Effect of aging on nematode

SUMMARY
Analysis of C.elegans at 3 points during aging: late larval L4 stage, days 6 and 15 of adulthood. C. elegans exhibits increased susceptibility to bacterial infection with age. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the decline in immune function with aging (immunosenescence).

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans
