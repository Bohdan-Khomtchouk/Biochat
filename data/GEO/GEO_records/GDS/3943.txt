TITLE
Effect of aging on nematode

SUMMARY
Analysis of C.elegans at 3 points during aging: late larval L4 stage, days 6 and 15 of adulthood. C. elegans exhibits increased susceptibility to bacterial infection with age. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the decline in immune function with aging (immunosenescence).
