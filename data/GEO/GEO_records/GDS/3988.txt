TITLE
Intrahippocampal kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy: dentate gyrus

SUMMARY
Analysis of an animal model of focal epilepsy in which kainic acid (KA) is injected into the right posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus (DG) adjacent to the KA lesion and the non-lesioned contralateral side were examined in each animal. Results provide insight into molecular basis of epilepsy.
