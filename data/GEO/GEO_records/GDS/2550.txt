TITLE
Recycling factor p110 mutation effect on embryonic development

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3 and 5-day egy mutant embryos, which contain a mutation in recycling factor p110. This mutation leads to microcephaly and thymus hypoplasia. U4/U6 snRNPs are disrupted in egy mutants. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these developmental defects.
