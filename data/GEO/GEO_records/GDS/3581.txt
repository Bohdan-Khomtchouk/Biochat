TITLE
Anti-mitotic compound MT7 effect on immortalized cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells treated for up to 12 hrs with MT7, an anti-mitotic compound from a combinatorial library. MT7 inhibits cell proliferation by arresting mitosis specifically and reversibly in various tumor cell lines of human origin. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of MT7.
