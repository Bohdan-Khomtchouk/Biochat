TITLE
Strain PAO1 response to natural quorum sensing inhibitor protoanemonin

SUMMARY
Analysis of laboratory strain PAO1 treated with 125Î¼M protoanemonin (4-methylenebut-2-en-4-olide), a natural quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying protoanemonin inhibition of QS in P. aeruginosa.

ORGANISM
