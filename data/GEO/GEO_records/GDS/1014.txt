TITLE
Serum response factor SRF overexpression in embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryonic stem (ES) cells overexpressing serum response factor SRF.  SRF transiently transfected into ES cells disrupted for both copies of SRF.  RNA examined 72 hours after transfection.  Results identify potential transcriptional targets of SRF.
