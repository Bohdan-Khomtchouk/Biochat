TITLE
Diabetic nephropathy: models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes

SUMMARY
Examination of kidneys from streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6J and db/db animals, which are models for type I and type II diabetes, respectively. Results identify HSD3-beta 4 and OPN as classifiers for the mesangial matrix expansion phenotype, an indicator for end-stage renal disease.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

PLATFORM
GPL409 : cDNA spotted microarray
