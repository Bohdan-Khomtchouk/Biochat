TITLE
Cyclophilin B depletion effect on glioblastoma multiforme cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of U251 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells depleted for cyclophilin B (CypB), a prolyl isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum. CypB depletion reduces GBM cell survival. Results provide insight into the role of CypB in the survival of GBM cells.
