TITLE
Tristetrapolin-deficiency and mRNA decay in fibroblasts: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of tristetrapolin (TTP)-deficient fibroblasts after serum activation and subsequent actinomycin D treatment for up to 120 minutes. TTP is a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein that binds to AU-rich elements in mRNA, leading to increases in the rates of mRNA deadenylation and destruction.
