TITLE
NOD mice positive for Early Insulin AutoAntibodies: pancreatic lymph nodes

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic lymph nodes of Early Insulin AutoAntibodies (E-IAA) positive 5 wk-old Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice. E-IAA mark the first measurable phenotypic checkpoint in T1D pathogenesis. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying initiation of T1D.
