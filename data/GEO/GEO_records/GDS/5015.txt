TITLE
Modified natural and stimulated in vitro fertilization cycles: cumulus cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of cumulus cells surrounding mature oocytes derived from modified natural in vitro fertilization (IVF) and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation IVF cycles. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the lower success rates of modified natural IVF.
