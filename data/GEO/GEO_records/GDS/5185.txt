TITLE
Wig-1 depletion effect on brain striatum of mutant huntingtin transgenic animal

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain striata of BACHD animals depleted for the transcription factor wig-1. BACHD, a model for Huntingtonâ€™s disease, harbors the human mutant huntingtin gene. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways affected by wig-1 depletion in the BACHD striatum.
