TITLE
Bexarotene effect on gemcitabine resistant non-small lung cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of gemcitabine (Gem)-resistant non-small lung cancer Calu3 cells treated with bexarotene (Bex). Acquired drug resistance is a major obstacle in cancer therapy. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of bexarotene to overcome Gem-resistance in Calu3 cells.
