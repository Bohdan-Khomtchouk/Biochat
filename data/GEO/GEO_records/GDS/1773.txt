TITLE
B-form DNA transfection effect on TBK1 and IKKi deficient embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblast deficient in kinases TBK1, IKKi (Ikbke), or both following transfection with B-form DNA. B-DNA transfection triggers interferon-beta production via TBK1 and IKKi. Results provide insight into the mechanisms of intracellular recognition of DNA during infection.
