TITLE
Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis: intestinal biopsies

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon mucosal tissue from 10 monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for ulcerative colitis (UC). Twins (paired samples) were analyzed to obtain mucosal response data independent of genetic variation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying UC.
