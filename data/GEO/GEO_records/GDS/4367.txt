TITLE
Azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer model: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of colon from AOM/DSS-induced model of ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer (UC-CRC). Nonresolving inflammation is associated with increased incidence of CRC. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the development from colitis to colorectal cancer.
