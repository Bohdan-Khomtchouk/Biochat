TITLE
Muscle cell survival mediated by transcriptional coactivator p300

SUMMARY
Analysis of insulin growth factor II deficient C2AS12 myoblasts expressing wild type or protein interaction domain mutant p300 at 0 and 24 hours after a switch to low serum media. Wild type but not the mutant p300 prevents the progressive cell death induced by serum withdrawal.
