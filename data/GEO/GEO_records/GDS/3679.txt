TITLE
Morbid obesity: subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of SC and OM adipose tissue collected from morbidly obese patients.  Patients grouped as Low or High Acylation Stimulating protein (ASP) and Triglyceride (TG). ASP is associated with various metabolic disorders. Results provide insight into molecular basis of the two ASP-TG lipemic indices.
