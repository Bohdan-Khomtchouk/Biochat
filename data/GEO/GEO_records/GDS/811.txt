TITLE
Amyloid precursor protein mutant overexpression in strain resistant to neuronal cell loss

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of brain left hippocampi from 12 month old Tg2576 transgenics overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (APPSw).  APPSw linked to the early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  Tg2576 express neuroprotective genes that prevent neuronal cell loss.
