TITLE
Sulfur dioxide-induced airways disease model: lungs

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of spontaneously hypertensive (SH) animals after exposure to 350 ppm sulfur dioxide 5 hours per day for 4 days. Results provide insight into the molecular and genetic basis of the greater susceptibility of SH animals to sulfur dioxide-induced airways disease.
