TITLE
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers effect on adrenocortical carcinoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells treated with the hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyl ether (PBDE) 2-OH-BDE47 or 2-OH-BDE85. PBDEs are used as flame retardants in various products. The two PBDEs are cytotoxic. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PBDE cytotoxicity.
