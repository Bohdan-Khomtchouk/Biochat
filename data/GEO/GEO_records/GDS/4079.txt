TITLE
Breast lipotransfer white adipose tissue CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissue (WAT) CD34+ cells from breast lipotransfer aspirates and marrow-derived CD34+ cells from leukapheresis of normal patients. WAT is a rich reservoir of CD45-CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Results provide insight into role of WAT CD34+ cells in cancer growth.
