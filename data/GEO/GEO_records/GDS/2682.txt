TITLE
Conjunctiva and cornea comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of conjunctival (Cnj) and corneal (Co) epithelia, the main cellular components of the ocular surface. Cnj and Co epithelia are embryologically related but phenotypically and functionally disparate. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of these differences.
