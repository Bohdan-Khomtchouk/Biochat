TITLE
Kruppel-like transcription factor 7 knockout effect on the olfactory epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of olfactory epithelia from Kruppel-like transcription factor 7 (KLF7) knockout mutants. Kruppel-like transcription factors are important regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation in several organ systems. KLF7 knockout leads to impaired axon projection in the olfactory system.
