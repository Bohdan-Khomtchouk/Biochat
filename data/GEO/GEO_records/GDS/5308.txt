TITLE
Antidepressant fluoxetine effect on depression model: ventral dentate gyrus

SUMMARY
Analysis of ventral dentate gyrus from adults subjected to chronic corticosterone (CORT) to induce depression-like behaviors, followed by combined treatment of CORT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of antidepressant resistance.
