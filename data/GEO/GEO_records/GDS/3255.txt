TITLE
Held out wing mutant embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutant embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic Held out wing (HOW), an RNA-binding protein (RBP) highly expressed in the mesoderm during early embryogenesis. how mutant embryos exhibit aberrant mesoderm spreading. Results provide insight into the role of HOW in mesoderm development.
