TITLE
c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway activation and suppression effect on aortic vascular smooth muscle cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells following c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation or JNK suppression with H202 treatment to induce oxidative stress (OS). OS is linked to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and activates JNK. Results provide insight into the role of JNK in AAA.
