TITLE
Cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy model

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart left ventricles (LVs) of animals with pressure overload LV hypertrophy (LVH) caused by transverse aortic constriction.  Pressure overload on the heart resulting from chronic hypertension or aortic stenosis is a stimulus for LVH. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of LVH.
