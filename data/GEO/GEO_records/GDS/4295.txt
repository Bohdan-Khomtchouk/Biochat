TITLE
Histone methyltransferase H3K79 Dot1l deletion effect on MLL-AF9 leukemia cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL)-AF9 leukemia cells after loss of Dot1l for up to 7 days. Loss of Dot1l leads to decreased growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of MLL-AF9 cells. Results provide insight into role of Dot1l in MLL-rearranged leukemia.
