TITLE
Liver response to antagonism of endogenous microRNA-122 using a chemically modified antisense oligonucleotide: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from NMRI females treated with 25mg/kg LNA (locked nucleic acid)-antimiR-122 on day 2 and sacrificed at days 3, 9 and 23. Results  provide insight into the utility of LNA-modified oligonucleotides in silencing miRNAs in vivo.
