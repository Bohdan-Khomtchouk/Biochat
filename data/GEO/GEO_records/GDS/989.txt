TITLE
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus infected cell lines

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cell lines BCBL-1 and BC-3 infected by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Raji infected by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and BC-1 infected by both viruses.  Results identify expression patterns specific to KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma derived cells.
