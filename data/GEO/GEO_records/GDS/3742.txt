TITLE
Zinc excess effect on cyanobacterium Synechocystis cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cyanobacterium cultures subjected to zinc excess (776 uM) for up to 4 hrs. Although an essential metal, Zn at excess levels can disturb metal homeostasis leading to oxidative stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria stress response to Zn toxicity

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

PLATFORM
GPL3214 : Takara CyanoChip v.2.0
