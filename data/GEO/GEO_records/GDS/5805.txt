TITLE
Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 deficiency effect on prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer (PC) cell lines LNCap (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent) following siRNA-mediated knockdown of Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Pin1 modulation of both PC two cell lines.
