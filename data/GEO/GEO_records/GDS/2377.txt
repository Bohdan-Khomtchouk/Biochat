TITLE
Response to copper stress conditions

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells subjected to elevated copper (Cu) for 45 minutes (Cu shock) or grown in the presence of elevated Cu for 6 hours (Cu adapted). Industrial activity results in elevated levels of environmental Cu. Results provide insight into the molecular response of P. aeruginosa to Cu stress.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

PLATFORM
GPL84 : [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
