TITLE
Chronic myelogenous leukemia response to imatinib

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients prior to imatinib (Gleevec) treatment. Imatinib induces complete cytogenetic response (CCR) in most CML patients. This study attempts to determine transcriptional signature of imatinib non-responders.
