TITLE
HIV and tuberculosis co-infection: peripheral blood mononuclear cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from HIV patients with and without M. tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. Co-infection with TB is a cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. Results provide insight into a molecular signature to distinguish HIV/TB co-infected patients from HIV mono-infected patients.
