TITLE
High Mobility Group AT-hook Protein 2 deficiency effect on the embryonic lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from embryonic day 18.5 C57BL/6 mutants deficient for the High Mobility Group AT-hook Protein 2 (HMGA2). High-mobility-group proteins are abundant non-histone chromatin-associated proteins. Results provide insight into the role of HMGA2 in lung development.
