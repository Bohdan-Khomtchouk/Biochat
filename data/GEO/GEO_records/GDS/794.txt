TITLE
Cardiac hypertrophy progression: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of hearts from FVB males subjected to cardiac pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). TAC performed on 3 month old males.  Hearts examined 2, 10, and 21 days after surgery.  Results provide insight into the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.
