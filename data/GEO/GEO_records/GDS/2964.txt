TITLE
Retinal pigment epithelium development

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) of E7 to E18 embryos. The RPE regulates transport between the neural retina and fenestrated capillaries of the choroid, a vascular layer between the retina and sclera. Results provide insight into the extent of remodeling of the RPE during development.
