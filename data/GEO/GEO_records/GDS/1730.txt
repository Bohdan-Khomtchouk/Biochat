TITLE
Autocrine platelet-derived growth factor inhibition effect on malignant gliomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of U87 glioblastoma (GBM) cell clones overexpressing a dominant-negative form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A subunit to inactive the PDGF autocrine signaling loop. The autocrine PDGF loop is a hallmark of GBM. Results identify genes regulated by oncogenic PDGF signaling.
