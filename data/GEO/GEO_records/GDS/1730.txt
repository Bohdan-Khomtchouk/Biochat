TITLE
Autocrine platelet-derived growth factor inhibition effect on malignant gliomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of U87 glioblastoma (GBM) cell clones overexpressing a dominant-negative form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A subunit to inactive the PDGF autocrine signaling loop. The autocrine PDGF loop is a hallmark of GBM. Results identify genes regulated by oncogenic PDGF signaling.

CITATIONS
Ma D, Nutt CL, Shanehsaz P, Peng X et al. Autocrine platelet-derived growth factor-dependent gene expression in glioblastoma cells is mediated largely by activation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein and is associated with altered genotype and patient survival in human brain tumors.
