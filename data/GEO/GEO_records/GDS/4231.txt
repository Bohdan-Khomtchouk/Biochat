TITLE
Antiretroviral therapy effect on brain of patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders

SUMMARY
Analysis of postmortem brain of ART-treated, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) patients. ART reduces morbidity and mortality in HIV infection, but HAND persist despite treatment. Results provide insight into ART effectiveness in brain and into molecular signatures of HAND under ART.
