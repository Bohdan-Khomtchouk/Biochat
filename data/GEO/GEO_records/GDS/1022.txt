TITLE
Lung pneumocyte response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 lung pneumocytes after infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) PAK mutants deleted for various components of the type III secretion system (TTSS).  Mutants in TTSS effectors and translocators studied.  PA causes serious respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients.
