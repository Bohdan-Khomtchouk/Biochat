TITLE
NF-kappaB and phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor treated monocytes infected with the human cytomegalovirus

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes treated with an NF-kappaB or a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and then infected with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Results provide insight into the role of NF-kappaB and PI3K in the activation of monocytes to a proinflammatory state after an HCMV infection.
