TITLE
Jurkat T cell response to silver nanoparticles

SUMMARY
Analysis of Jurkat T cells exposed to to 0.2 mg/L of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Ag ions for 24 hours. Cell viability screening revealed that Jurkat T cells exhibit higher sensitivity to AgNPs than to Ag ions. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this difference in sensitivity.
