TITLE
Small molecule KY02111 effect on induced pluripotent stem cell line IMR90-1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of IMR90-1 iPSCs cultured in cardiac differentiation medium containing serum for 3 days, then treated with KY02111 for up to 24 hrs. KY02111 promotes differentiation of PSCs to cardiomyocytes. Results provide insight into molecular basis of KY02111-induced cardiac differentiation of PSCs.
