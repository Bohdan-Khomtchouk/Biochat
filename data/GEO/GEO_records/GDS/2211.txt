TITLE
Flagellin effect on toll-like receptor 5 deficient intestinal epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) null animals stimulated with flagellin. TLR5 mediates the immune response to flagellin. Results provide insight into the role of IECs in the innate immune response mediated by TLR5.
