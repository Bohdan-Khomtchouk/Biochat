TITLE
Sonic Hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine effect on co-culture of mesenchymal stem cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of a co-culture of 92% human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and 8% human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvEC) treated with the Sonic Hedgehog morphogen inhibitor cyclopamine. The co-culture of hMSC and huvEC supports the formation of a primitive three dimensional vascular network.
