TITLE
Skin carcinogenesis model

SUMMARY
Analysis of papillomas initiated by DMBA/TPA treatment of epidermal keratinocytes deficient for activating transcriptional factor 2 (ATF2).  ATF2 mutant animals show increased susceptibility to papillomas relative to the WT counterparts. Results provide insight into the role of ATF2 in skin cancer.
