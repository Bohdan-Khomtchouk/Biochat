TITLE
Relaxation response practice effect on blood

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole blood from long-term practitioners of daily relaxation response (RR) practice and those with short-term (8 wks) RR training. RR is a mind-body intervention that offsets the physiological effects caused by stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the RR.
