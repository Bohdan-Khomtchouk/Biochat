TITLE
Central nervous system cell types derived from embryonic stem cell line H9

SUMMARY
Analysis of hESC (H9)-derived CNS cell types: neural rosettes, neurons, astrocytes and immature oligodendrocytes. Results provide insight into molecular profiles of CNS neuronal populations susceptible to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection.
