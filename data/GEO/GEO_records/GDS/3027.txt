TITLE
Early-early stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy: quadriceps

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles from 1.5 to 61 month old children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a degenerative skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Results provide insight into the early phases of DMD pathogenesis and pathophysiology.
