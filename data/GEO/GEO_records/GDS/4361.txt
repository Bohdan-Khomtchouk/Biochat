TITLE
AP1510, TGFα  or heregulin ligand effect on MCF10 mammary epithelial cells expressing HER2-FKBP-HA chimeric receptors

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary epithelial MCF10A/HER2/FKBP/HA cells treated with AP1510 to induce the chimeric HER2-FKBP molecule to homodimerize, or with TGFα or heregulin to induce heterodimerization with EGFR or HER3. Results provide insight into signaling events following HER2 receptor dimerization.
