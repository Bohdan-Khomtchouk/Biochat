TITLE
Monocyte-derived macrophages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients response to fine and ultrafine particles

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocyte-derived macrophages from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients after in vitro treatment with a mix of fine titanium dioxide (TiO2) and ultrafine Printex 90 particles, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TiO2 and Printex 90 are used in the manufacture of many products.
