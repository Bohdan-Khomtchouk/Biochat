TITLE
Conjugated linoleic acid isomers effect on intestinal cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestinal Caco-2 cells treated with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer trans-10, cis-12 CLA or cis-9, trans-11 CLA. CLA exerts isomer-specific effects on transepithelial calcium transport and cell growth in Caco-2 cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of action.
