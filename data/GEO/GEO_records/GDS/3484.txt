TITLE
Insulin-like growth factor-I effect on breast cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MCF-7 cells stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) for 3 or 24 hours. High serum IGF-I levels are associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of IGF-1 in the development and progression of breast cancer.
