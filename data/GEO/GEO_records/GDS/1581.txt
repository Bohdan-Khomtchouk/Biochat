TITLE
Embryonic kidney: ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme (RG-U34B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of ureteric buds (UBs) and metanephric mesenchyme (MM) from E13.5 kidneys. UB-secreted factors induce conversion of adjacent MM cells into nephrons. Results identify as potential regulators a set of 20 secreted molecules specific to the UB and conserved between species.
