TITLE
Neonatal mononuclear cell response to lipopolysaccharide

SUMMARY
Analysis of neonatal mononuclear cells from cord blood incubated with 5 ug/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Effect of LPS on adult mononuclear cells from peripheral blood compared. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for increased susceptibility of neonates to sepsis.
