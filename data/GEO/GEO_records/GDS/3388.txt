TITLE
Bisphenol A effect on nonmalignant breast epithelial cell aspirates from breast cancer patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of random periareolar fine-needle aspirates collected from unafflicted, contralateral breast tissue of breast cancer patients and treated with bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is a prevalent xenoestrogen. Results provide insight into early molecular events induced by BPA in susceptible breast tissue.
