TITLE
Gpr1 receptor and Gpa2 G protein alpha subunit deletion mutants

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of mutants lacking the Gpr1 receptor or the Gpa2 G protein alpha subunit. Results provide insight into the role of the Gpr1 receptor and the Gpa2 G protein alpha subunit in the maintenance and modulation of cell size in response to glucose.

ORGANISM
