TITLE
Essential hypertension BPH model

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of adrenal glands from blood pressure high (BPH) males at the prehypertensive stage. BPH males examined at 5 weeks of age. Results compared to gene expression in SHR rat model, and provides insight into mechanisms of hypertension shared across species.
