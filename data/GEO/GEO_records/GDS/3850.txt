TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligand treatment: adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3 tissue types from lean and insulin resistant, obese Zucker rats untreated or treated with 1 of 4 PPARγ ligands (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone, AG035029).  Results provide insight into the role of PPARγ as an essential mediator for maintenance of body insulin sensitivity.
