TITLE
Skeletal muscle initial response to concentric resistance exercise training: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis biopsies taken at the outset (day 1, 2 and 4) of concentric resistance exercise (RE) training in RE naive individuals. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the initial transient response of skeletal muscle to concentric RE.
