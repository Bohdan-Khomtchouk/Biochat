TITLE
Exercise training effect on metabolic syndrome patients: vastus lateralis muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle from metabolic syndrome (MS) female patients before and after 6 months of exercise training. MS is associated with insulin resistance. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin-resistant skeletal muscle in MS patients.
