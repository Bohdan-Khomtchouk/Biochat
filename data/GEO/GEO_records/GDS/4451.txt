TITLE
Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy patient-specific iPSC model

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD) patient dermal fibroblasts. Inflammatory brain demyelination is observed in CCALD patients. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying CCALD pathogenesis.
