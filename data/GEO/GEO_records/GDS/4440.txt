TITLE
Transcription factor Otx2 knockout effect on fourth ventricular choroid plexus

SUMMARY
Analysis of fourth ventricular choroid plexus tissue from Otx2 knockout mice at E13. Choroid plexuses (ChPs) are main regulators of cerebrospinal fluid composition in developing brain. Results provide insight into role of transcription factor Otx2 in development and maintenance of ChP cells.
