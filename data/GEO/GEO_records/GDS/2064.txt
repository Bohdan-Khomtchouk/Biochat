TITLE
MicroRNA miR156b and miR164b overexpression effect on floral apex

SUMMARY
Analysis of floral apices of transgenics overexpressing miRNA miR156b or miR164b. Most plant miRNAs have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their targets. However, targets with up to 5 mismatches exist. Results provide insight into the mechanism of target recognition by plant miRNA.
