TITLE
Polychlorobiphenyl non-coplanar congener PCB-153 effect on liver cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of a metabolically competent HepG2 cells exposed to PCB-153, a prototype non-coplanar congener of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB). Different congeners of PCB lead to varying degrees of cellular oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of non-coplanar PCB congeners.
