TITLE
H3K79 histone methyl transferase DOT1L inhibitor Compound 55 effect on breast cancer cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 like) inhibitor Compound 55 or DOT1L siRNA. DOT1L is a histone H3-lysine79 (H3K79) methyltransferase. Results provide insight into the role of DOT1L/H3K79 methylation in breast cancer.
