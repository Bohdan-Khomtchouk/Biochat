TITLE
Gonadal development: ovaries and testes

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonads from fetal, neonatal and adult C57BL/6 males and females. Events during meiosis I prophase are critical for correct segregation of chromosomes. Defects in these events may contribute to infertility. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying meiosis I prophase.
