TITLE
Immature dendritic cell response to butanol fraction of Echinacea purpurea: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of immature dendritic cell lines (iDCs) treated with the butanol-fraction of stems and leaves of E. purpurea [BF/S+L/Ep] containing defined bioactive phytocompounds. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the immune-modulatory activities induced by the phytocompounds.
