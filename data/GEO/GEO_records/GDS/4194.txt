TITLE
NZB/W model of systemic lupus erythematosus: renal macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of F4/80hi renal macrophages isolated at an early stage of lupus, during lupus nephritis, and after induction of remission. The infiltrating F4/80hi cells are associated with renal damage. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which F4/80hi macrophages contribute to lupus nephritis.
