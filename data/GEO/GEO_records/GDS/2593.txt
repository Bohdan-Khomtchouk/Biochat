TITLE
Wild type cells at various growth rates

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells at various growth rates during balanced growth in chemostat. Results compared to those from cells overexpressing NOX. NOX allows cells to recycle the excess NADH during rapid growth. OD600 of 0.19 to 0.6 examined. Part of a study tracking responses to various perturbations.
