Topical protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor effect on graft model of alopecia areata: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin from C3H/HeJ grafted recipients with established alopecia areata (AA) following alopecic graft transplantation that were treated with topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib or tofacitinib for up to 24 wks. Results provide insight into molecular basis of AA pathogenesis.
