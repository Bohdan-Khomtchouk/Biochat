TITLE
Lung response to infection with Staphylococcus aureus Hla-deficient isogenic mutant: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from C57BL/6J females up to 24hrs post-infection with mutant S. aureus deficient in alpha-hemolysin (Hla). Hla is a pore-forming cytotoxin. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to Hla in the context of S. aureus infection.
