TITLE
Colorectal cancer progression: polysomal mRNA profiles

SUMMARY
Comparison of polysomal RNA from isogenic cell lines established from a colorectal cancer (CRC) patient. SW480 and SW620 cells derived from the primary tumor and a lymph node metastasis, respectively. The cell lines constitute a cellular model of CRC transition from invasive carcinoma to metastasis.
