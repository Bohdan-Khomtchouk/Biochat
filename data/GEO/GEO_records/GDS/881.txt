TITLE
Breast cancer and selective estrogen receptor modulators

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene stimulation and inhibition by the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) and raloxifene (Ral) or ICI 182,780 (ICI) and by estradiol (E2) in estrogen receptor-containing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cells were treated for 8 or 48 hours.
