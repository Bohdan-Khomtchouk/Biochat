TITLE
HIV infection effect on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from HIV patients at different clinical stages and rates of disease progression. Changes in T-cell function are a hallmark of HIV infection. Results provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms in HIV infections that lead to these changes in T-cell function.

CITATIONS
Hyrcza MD, Kovacs C, Loutfy M, Halpenny R et al. Distinct transcriptional profiles in ex vivo CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are established early in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and are characterized by a chronic interferon response as well as extensive transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cells.
