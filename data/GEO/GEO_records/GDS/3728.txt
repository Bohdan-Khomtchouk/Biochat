TITLE
X chromosome dosage model

SUMMARY
Analysis of four somatic tissues (brain, liver, kidney and muscle) from 12-week-old 40,XX and X monosomic (39,XO) mice. In humans, complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome results in Turner syndrome (45,XO). Genes deregulated in XO mice provide insight into the molecular basis of TS.
