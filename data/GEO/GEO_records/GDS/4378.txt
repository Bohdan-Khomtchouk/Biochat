TITLE
Ozone effect on G-protein double-null mutant leaves: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaves from G-protein double mutant gpa1-4/agb1-2 plants with null mutations in the α- and β-subunits that were exposed to 125 ppb ozone for up to 2 days. Results provide insight into the role of G-protein signaling pathways in plant response to ozone exposure.
