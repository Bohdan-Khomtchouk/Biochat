TITLE
Skeletal muscle during a 24-hour (12 hour light:12 hour dark) cycle

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastrocnemius muscles of Wistar animals during a 24-hour period, from zeitgeber time (ZT) 0.25 to ZT 23.75. Results provide insight into baseline patterns of gene expression in normal skeletal muscle within the 24 hour circadian cycle.
