TITLE
Rhesus macaque type-I interferon agonist effect on peripheral whole blood of SIV-infected Sooty mangabeys: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of whole blood from 8 naturally SIV-infected SMs treated with recombinant RM IFNalpha2-IgFc (rmIFNα2) for 16 weeks. SIV infection of SMs is typically non-pathogenic. Results provide insight into effects of experimentally-augmented IFN-I signaling in chronically SIV-infected SMs.

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta
