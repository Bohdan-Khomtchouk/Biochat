TITLE
Pediatric acute leukemia patients with early relapse: white blood cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of WBCs from pediatric B cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with early, late, or no relapse. For patients with relapsed BCP-ALL, early relapses fare worse than later relapses. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of early relapses in BCP-ALL.
