TITLE
Pulmonary vascular microendothelial cell response to mutations in type 2 receptor for the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway, BMPR2

SUMMARY
Analysis of PMVECs cultured from triple transgenics carrying immortomouse gene, a transactivator, and either control, Bmpr2delx4+ or Bmpr2R899X mutation. Hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension is often associated with BMPR2 mutations. Results provide insight into role of Bmpr2 in endothelium.
