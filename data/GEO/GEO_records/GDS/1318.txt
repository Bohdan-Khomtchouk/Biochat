TITLE
Hormone-sensitive lipase inactivation effect on muscle

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of soleus muscle from females lacking the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) gene. HSL is a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization in adipocytes and found to be active in skeletal muscle. Results provide insight into the role of HSL in muscle lipid metabolism.
