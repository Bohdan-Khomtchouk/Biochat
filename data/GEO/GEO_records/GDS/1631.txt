TITLE
Osteoblast differentiation (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS-sorted bone cells 7 and 17 days following induction of differentiation. Cells sorted based on GFP expression from a promoter that becomes active in the preosteoblastic stage between days 5 and 7 or from one that remains inactive until the osteoblastic stage between days 15 and 17.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
