TITLE
Zinc-finger protein basonuclin knockdown effect on oocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of oocytes following RNAi knockdown of basonuclin (Bnc1), a zinc-finger protein found in abundance in oocytes. The Bnc1 gene qualifies as a maternal-effect gene because the source of pre-implantation embryonic Bnc1 is maternal. Results provide insight into the function of Bnc1.
