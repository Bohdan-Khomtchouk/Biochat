TITLE
Dietary iron-deficiency effect on jejunum (RAE230B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of jejunum from iron (Fe)-deprived 12-week-old Sprague Dawleys. Results provide insight into the genetic response to Fe deprivation in the jejunum versus the duodenum (characterized earlier) and the role of distal gut segments in increasing Fe absorption in conditions of Fe-deficiency.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
