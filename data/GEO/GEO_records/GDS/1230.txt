TITLE
Hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell comparison (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Comparison of CD34+CD33-CD38-Rho(lo)c-kit+ cells, enriched for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC), to CD34+CD33-CD38-Rho(hi) cells, enriched for committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Cells obtained from umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. Provides insight into control of HSC fate.
