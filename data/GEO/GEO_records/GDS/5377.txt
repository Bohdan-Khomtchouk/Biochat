TITLE
Folate deficiency effect on methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR+/- intestinal neoplasia model: duodenum

SUMMARY
Analysis of intestine from MTHFR+/- BALB/c mice fed a low folate diet (0.3mg/kg) for 1 yr. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with risk for colorectal cancer. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying the impact of folate and MTHFR deficiency on tumorigenesis.
