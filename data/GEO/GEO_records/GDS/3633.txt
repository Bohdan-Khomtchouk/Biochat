TITLE
p24 deficiency

SUMMARY
Analysis of abdominal and head/thorax segments of mutants lacking p24. Members of the p24 protein family are transmembrane constituents of the ER and Golgi-derived transport vesicles that function in trafficking secretory proteins. Results provide insight into the effect of the loss of p24 function.

ORGANISM
