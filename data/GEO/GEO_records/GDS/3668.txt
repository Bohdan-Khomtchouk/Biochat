TITLE
Familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis: monocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes (MO) from familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients. FH patients have a defective or missing LDLR resulting in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesions often contain MO-derived, lipid-laden macrophages. Results provide insight into the role of MO in onset of atherosclerosis.
