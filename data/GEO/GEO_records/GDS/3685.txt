TITLE
Livers with Dicer1 deficient hepatocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver with hepatocytes lacking Dicer1. Dicer1 is an RNaseIII-type enzyme that cleaves both long double-stranded RNA molecules and hairpin miRNA precursors, and it is required for the processing of all miRNAs. Results provide insight into the function of Dicer1 in the liver.
