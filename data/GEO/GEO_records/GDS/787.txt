TITLE
Presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double knockout effect on brain cerebral cortex

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of brain cerebral cortex from presenilin (PS) 1 and 2 conditional double knockout (cDKO) mutant at 6 months of age.  PS inactivation is restricted to the forebrain. PS1 and PS2 mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease. Inflammatory markers upregulated in PS cDKO.
