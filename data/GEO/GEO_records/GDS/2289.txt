TITLE
PPARalpha overexpression effect on skeletal muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles of transgenics (trs) overexpressing PPARalpha. Trs overexpressing PPARalpha develop glucose intolerance despite protection from diet-induced obesity. Results provide insight into the role of PPARalpha in the development of insulin-resistant diabetes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
