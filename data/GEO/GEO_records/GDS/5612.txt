TITLE
Sirtuin-1 activator resveratrol effect on adult secondary neurospheres

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult secondary neurospheres derived from hippocampal neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells and treated with resveratrol, an activator of NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1). Results provide insight into the role of Sirt1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
