TITLE
Skeletal myoblast cell line KM109 differentiation: time course (II, dye-swap)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of primary myoblast cell line KM109 obtained from muscle biopsy of a healthy individual and induced to differentiate by serum deprivation. Cells examined at various time points up to 14 days following serum deprivation. Results provide insight into late myogenesis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens
