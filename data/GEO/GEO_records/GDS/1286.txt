TITLE
Esophageal cell response to low pH: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of esophageal cell line SKGT4 following exposure to low pH 6.5. Cells examined at various time points up to 2 hours following exposure. Results provide insight into role of gastric acid in pathogenesis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD) and esophagus adenocarcinoma.
