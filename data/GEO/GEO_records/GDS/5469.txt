TITLE
Left ventricle myocardium from MerCreMer model of transient cardiomyopathy: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of left ventricle myocardium from the MCM model of cardiomyopathy. Transient cardiomyopathy develops in this model after 5 day exposure to tamoxifen, with peak heart failure (HF) at day 10, and resolved HF at day 28. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of evolving HF.
