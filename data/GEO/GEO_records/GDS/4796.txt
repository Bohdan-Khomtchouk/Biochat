TITLE
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid depletion effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from C57Bl/6J males fed an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) depleted diet for 3 months. Livers examined at the fed and fasting state. Result provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of hepatic steatosis associated with n-3 PUFA depletion.
