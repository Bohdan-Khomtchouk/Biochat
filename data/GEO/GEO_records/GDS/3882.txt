TITLE
Type 2 diabetic pancreatic islets of Langerhans

SUMMARY
Analysis of islet of Langerhans isolated from type 2 diabetic (T2D) organ donors. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are critical regulators of pancreatic β cell mass and survival. Results provide insight into a role for class II PI3Ks in insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells.
