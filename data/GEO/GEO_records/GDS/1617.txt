TITLE
Motexafin gadolinium and zinc effect on Ramos B-cell lymphoma line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ramos B-cell lymphoma cultures following 4 hour treatment with anticancer agent motexafin gadolinium (MGd), zinc acetate (25 or 50 uM), or combinations of MGd and zinc. Results provide insight into the molecular changes that accompany the disruption of intracellular zinc homeostasis.
