TITLE
Valproic acid effect on theca cells (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal theca cells treated with 500 uM valproic acid (VPA), an anti-epilipetic that induces polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like symptoms. Theca cells from PCOS patients also examined. Results provide insight into the underlying mechanisms contributing to VPA-induced PCOS-like symptoms.
