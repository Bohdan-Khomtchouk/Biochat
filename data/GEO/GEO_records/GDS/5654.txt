TITLE
Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose tissue from two subcutaneous depots (inguinal and axillary) and two visceral depots (epididymal and mesenteric) from age-matched, C57Bl/6 males. SubQ and VISC represent two broad categories of obesity. Results provide insight into fat depot-specific molecular profiles.
