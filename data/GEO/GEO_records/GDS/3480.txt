TITLE
Sox10 depletion effect on Schwannoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of RT4D6 Schwannoma cells depleted for Sox10, an Sry-related HMG-Box transcription factor. Sox10 is important in the development of several cell lineages including neural crest stem cells and the derivative peripheral glial cells and melanocytes. Results identify Sox10 gene targets.
