TITLE
BPH/J2 model of neurogenic hypertension: hypothalamus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypothalamus from young (6 week-old) and adult (26 week-old) BPH/2J hypertensive males and age-/gender-matched normotensive BPN/3J controls. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying early and established neurogenic hypertension in hypothalamus.
