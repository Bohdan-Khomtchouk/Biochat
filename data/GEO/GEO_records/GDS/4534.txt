TITLE
HdhQ111 knock-in model of Huntington's disease: striatum and cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of striatum and cerebellum from a HdhQ111/111 knock-in model of Huntington's disease (HD). The 10-week HdhQ111/111 mice exhibit somatic instability in striatum but not in cerebellum. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of tissue-specific somatic instability.
