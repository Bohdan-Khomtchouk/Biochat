TITLE
Hypoxia-inducible factors-1 and -2 overexpression effect on embryonic kidney cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293T embryonic kidney cells subjected to hypoxia or overexpressing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, degradation resistant HIF-1, or HIF-2. Results provide insight into the respective roles of HIF-1 and HIF-2 in the cellular response to hypoxia.
