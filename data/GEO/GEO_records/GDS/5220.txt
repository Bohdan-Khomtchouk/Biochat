TITLE
bZIP transcription factor E4bp4 deficiency effect on lineage-depleted bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild-type and E4bp4-knockout lineage-depleted bone marrow which is enriched for hematopoietic progenitor cells.  Transcription factor E4bp4 (Nfil3) is essential for natural killer (NK) cell development. Results provide insight into downstream targets of E4bp4 in early NK development.
