TITLE
Notch1 overexpression model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: double positive CD4+/8+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of DP (CD4+/8+) cells from an intracellular Notch1 (Notch1-IC)-induced T-ALL model that recapitulates most features of human T-ALL. T-ALL malignancy is driven by oncogenic activation of NOTCH1 signaling. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Notch1-driven leukemogenesis.
