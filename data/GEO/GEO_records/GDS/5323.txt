TITLE
CREB-Binding Protein Inhibitor ICG-001 effect on pancreatic cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of AsPC1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells treated with IGC-001 up to 24 hours. IGC-001 binds to CREB-binding protein to disrupt its interaction with β-catenin. Results compared to β-catenin depletion (GDS5324) and provide insight into the therapeutic potential of IGC-001 in PDAC.
