TITLE
Leukemia-specific fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown effect on ETV6/RUNX1-positive, B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of ETV6/RUNX1 (E/R) fusion gene-positive, BCP ALL cell lines (AT2 and REH) following E/R knockdown. E/R (also known as TEL/AML1) is the most frequent gene fusion in childhood ALL. Results provide insight into role of E/R gene fusion in leukemia propagation and maintenance.
