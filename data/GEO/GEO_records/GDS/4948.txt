TITLE
Transforming growth factor beta effect on cytokine-activated, NOD-derived, splenic natural killer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of NOD-derived, splenic natural killer (NK) cells cultured with or without cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 + IL-18 in the absence of TGF-β, or with both cytokines in the presence of TGF-β. Results provide insight into the impact of TGF-β on NK cells independent of general activation.
