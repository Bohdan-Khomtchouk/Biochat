TITLE
Immortalized endothelial cell line response to atorvastatin

SUMMARY
Analysis of EA.hy926, an immortalized umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line, and its primary cell counterpart following treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin to inhibit the mevalonate pathway. Results suggest EA.hy926 cells have retained endothelial cell-specific features.
