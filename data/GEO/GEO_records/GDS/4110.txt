TITLE
Inactivation of wt-p53 function in hTERT immortalized prostate epithelial EP156T cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of EP156T cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding either p53R175H mutant (M cells), dominant-negative p53 peptide GSE56 (G cells) or control vector (C cells). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying early stages of transformation.
