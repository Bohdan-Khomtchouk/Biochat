TITLE
RNA polymerase II associated protein Paf1 depletion: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells depleted of Paf1, an RNA polymerase II associated protein. Cells were examined at various time points up to 8 hours following the inactivation of Paf1 expression from a tetracycline-regulated promoter using doxycyline (DOX). Results identify the primary targets of Paf1.
