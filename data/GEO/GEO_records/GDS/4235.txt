TITLE
Programmed Death 1 antibody effect on pathogenic Simian Immunodeficiency Virus infection: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from SIVmac251-infected (12 wks) rhesus macaques (RMs) treated with an antibody against Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) for 14 days. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which PD-1 blockade enhances survival of SIV-infected RMs.
