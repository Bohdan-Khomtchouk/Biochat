TITLE
House dust mite extract effect on a bronchial epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of H292 bronchial epithelial cells exposed to house dust mite (HDM) extract. More than just a physical barrier, epithelium can produce mediators in response to pathogens and allergens. Results provide insight into the nature of the response of bronchial epithelial cells to HDM allergen.
