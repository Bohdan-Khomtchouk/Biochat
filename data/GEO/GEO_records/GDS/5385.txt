TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide effect on tumor progression locus 2 kinase-deficient macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2)-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 hrs. Tpl2 (Map3k8) is a serine/threonine kinase critical in innate immunity. Results provide insight into the role of Tpl2 in BMDMs during acute inflammation.
