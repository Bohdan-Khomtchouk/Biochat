TITLE
Host cell response to HIV-1 Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant HIV-1 Vpr protein at various timepoints following doxycycline induction. Vpr advances HIV pathogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle at G2/M. Results identify changes in cellular gene expression associated with Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens
