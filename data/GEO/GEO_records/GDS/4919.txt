TITLE
Models of rhabdomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of MyoD-derived sarcomas derived from MDKP (MyoDCE/+; LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53Fl/Fl) mice and histological variants (UPS, pleomorphic RMS, and embryonal RMS) from P7KP (Pax7CE/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53Fl/Fl) mice. Results provide insight into molecular differences underlying the sarcoma subtypes.
