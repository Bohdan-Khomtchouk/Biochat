TITLE
Heat shock transcription factor 1 C-terminal domain mutant

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) C-terminal domain mutant (hsf1-ba1). The hsf1-ba1 mutation inhibits the heat-induced hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1. Results identify genes whose transcriptional response to heat shock is reduced by the hsf1-ba1 mutation.
