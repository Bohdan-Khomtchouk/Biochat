TITLE
Natural killer cell response to interleukin-2 treatment: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of resting natural killer (NK) cells and NK cells activated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for up to 24 hours.  The effector function of NK cells is enhanced by cytokines such as IL-2. Results provide insight into the molecular events in NK cell activation.
