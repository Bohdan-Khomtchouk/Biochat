TITLE
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned substantia nigra: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of substantia nigrae (SN) injured by treatment with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine at 1 and 7 days postlesion. Parkinson's disease (PD) culminates in the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the SN. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD.
