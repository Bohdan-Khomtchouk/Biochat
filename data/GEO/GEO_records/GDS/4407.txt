TITLE
Biallelic CEBPA-mutated acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from biallelic CEBPA (encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding protein)-mutated, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with or without multilineage dysplasia (MLD). Cases without CEBPA mutations also examined.  Results provide insight into the classification of CEBPA-mutated AML patients.
