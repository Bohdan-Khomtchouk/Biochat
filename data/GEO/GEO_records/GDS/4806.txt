TITLE
Pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist effect on various tissues: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver, heart, kidney and skeletal muscle from animals treated with different doses (therapeutic, toxic) of PPM-201, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist. Results provide insight into molecular bases of organ-specific toxicity induced by a panPPAR agonist.
