TITLE
TNFalpha effect on epidermal keratinocytes in the presence of NF-kappa B inhibitor: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of epidermal keratinocytes treated with TNFalpha in the presence of 10 uM parthenolide, an NF-kappa B inhibitor. Cells examined at various time points up to 48 hours following TNFalpha treatment. Results identify NF-kappa B-dependent subset of TNFalpha-regulated genes.
