TITLE
TRIF-deficient Herpes simplex encephalitis patient: peripheral blood mononuclear cell response to TLR agonists LPS and R-848

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs collected from an HSV1 encephalitis (HSE) patient with TRIF deficiency (homozygous TRIF nonsense mutation) and stimulated with LPS or resiquimod hydrochloride R-848. TRIF is the sole adaptor protein for TLR3. Results provide insight into the role of the TLR3 pathway in HSE.
