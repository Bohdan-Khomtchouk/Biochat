TITLE
Na+/H+ exchanger 3 deficiency effect on the colon

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutant colons lacking Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). NHE3 provides a major route for intestinal Na+ absorption. NHE3 deficient animals develop colitis restricted to the distal colonic mucosa. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of colitis development induced by NHE3 deficiency.
