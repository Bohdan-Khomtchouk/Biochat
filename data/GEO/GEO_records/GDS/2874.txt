TITLE
D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency effect on the embryonic head

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic head tissue lacking D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh). Mutations in human PHGDH gene cause serine deficiency disorders like congenital microcephaly and psychomotor retardation. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of SDD.
