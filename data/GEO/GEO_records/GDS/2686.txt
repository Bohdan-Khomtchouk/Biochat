TITLE
MyD88 deficient macrophage response to zymosan

SUMMARY
Analysis of MyD88-deficient macrophages treated with fungal cell wall component zymosan. Zymosan-induced Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is transduced via adaptor protein MyD88. Results provide insight into the role of non-TLR innate immune signaling in response to zymosan and pathogenic fungi.
