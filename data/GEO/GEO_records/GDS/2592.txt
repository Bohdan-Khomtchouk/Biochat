TITLE
NOX overexpressing cells at various growth rates

SUMMARY
Analysis of NOX overexpressing MG1655 cells at various growth rates during balanced growth in chemostat cultures. Cells with NOX recycle the excess NADH generated during rapid growth. OD600 of 0.13 to 0.4 examined. Part of a study tracking responses to chemical and physiological perturbations.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
