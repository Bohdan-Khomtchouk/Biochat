TITLE
NOD/SCID/huALL xenotransplant model of pediatric acute leukemia

SUMMARY
Analysis of xenograft leukemia samples from NOD/SCID mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients with pediatric BCP-ALL. The xenograft samples displayed short or long “Time To Leukemia” (TTL). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct TTL phenotypes.
