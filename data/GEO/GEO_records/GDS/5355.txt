TITLE
Histone demethylase RBP2 deficiency effect on MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cell line transfected with siRNAs against RBP2. RBP2 is a histone demethylase (also known as JARID1A and KDM5A) associated with breast cancer metastasis. Results provide insight into roles of RBP2 in breast cancer metastasis.
