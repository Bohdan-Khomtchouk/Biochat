TITLE
Resistance exercise training effect on the skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of biceps brachii muscles from trained and untrained arms 4 hours after an acute bout of bilateral arm resistance exercise (RE). Subjects underwent a 12 week progressive unilateral arm RE training program. Results provide insight into the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to RE training.
