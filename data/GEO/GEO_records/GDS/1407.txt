TITLE
Leukocyte inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole blood following 4 hour treatment with lipolysaccharide (LPS). Leukocytes from individuals with high and low responses to LPS examined. LPS response assessed by measuring cytokine production. Results provide insight into the variability of LPS responses between individuals.
