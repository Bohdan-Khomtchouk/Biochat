TITLE
Aiolos/OBF-1 double null mutation effect on bone marrow pre-BII cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow pre-BII cells from Aiolos/OBF-1 double null mutants. Aiolos is a chromatin regulator, OBF-1 a transcriptional activator. Small pre-BII to immature B cell transition is impaired in the double mutants. Results provide insight into the role of Aiolos and OBF-1 in pre-BII cells.
