TITLE
Lung tumors arising from Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and constitutively active Kras mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung tumors resulting from the concurrent activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and expression of a constitutively active Kras mutant in the lung epithelium. 21% of lung tumors have Kras mutations. Results provide insight into the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in lung cancer.
