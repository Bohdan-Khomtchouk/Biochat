TITLE
Lung apical membrane protein T1alpha null mutant effect on pulmonary development

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of lungs from apical membrane protein T1alpha null mutants at 18.5 days post coitum and at birth.  Lung alveolar epithelial type I cell differentiation is blocked in T1alpha null mutants.  Results provide insight into mechanisms controlling alveolar type I cell differentiation.

ORGANISM
