TITLE
Interleukin-1 effect on epidermal keratinocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of epidermal keratinocytes at various time points up to 48 hours post-interleukin-1 (IL-1) treatment. IL-1 is a proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine that plays a role in inflammatory diseases of the skin. Results provide insight into gene products that mediate the effects of IL-1.
