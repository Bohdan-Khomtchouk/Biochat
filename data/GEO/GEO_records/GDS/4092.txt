TITLE
Breast cancer cell lines treated with methylated or unmethylated DNA oligos

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer cell lines BT-20 and Hs578T treated with methylated or un-methylated CpG DNA oligos: CDH13 and ODN 2006. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms triggered by methylated, but not by unmethylated DNA, that could be involved in tumour biology.
