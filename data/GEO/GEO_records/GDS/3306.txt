TITLE
Two week storage and recovery of kidney HEK293 cells at ambient temperature

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 spheroids and monolayer controls subjected to dry storage for up to 2 weeks, followed by 0hr to 72hr recovery. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic arrest and recovery of HEK293 spheroids.
