TITLE
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma and various soft tissue sarcomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) tumors and various soft tissue sarcomas (STSs). MFH is characterized by non-recurrent complex chromosomal aberrations, and overlapping histological and immunohistochemical phenotypes. Results provide insight into the similarities between MFH and STSs.
