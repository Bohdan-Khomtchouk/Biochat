TITLE
Copper sulfate stress effect on kgb-1 mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of kgb-1 mutants incubated with 1mM copper sulfate for 1hr. The conserved KGB-1 JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates the response to heavy metal stress. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the heavy metal stress response.
