TITLE
Ribonucleoprotein- and polysome-associated mRNAs of the testis: time-course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and polysome fractions of prepuberal and adult testes. Protein synthesis occurs on polysomes and translationally inactive mRNAs are sequestered as RNPs. Results provide insight into the translation state of individual mRNAs as spermatogenesis proceeds.
