TITLE
mRNA cap-binding protein ABH1 mutant response to abscisic acid

SUMMARY
Analysis of abh1 mutants treated with abscisic acid (ABA). ABH1 encodes a nuclear mRNA cap-binding protein homolog. The abh1 mutant is hypersensitive to ABA, a plant hormone that regulates development and abiotic stress responses. Results provide insight into the role of ABH1 in ABA signaling.
