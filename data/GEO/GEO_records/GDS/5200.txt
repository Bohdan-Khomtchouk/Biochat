TITLE
Kruppel-like factor 5 deficiency in bladder epithelial cells effect on the fetal bladder

SUMMARY
Analysis of fetal bladders with Kruppel-like transcription factor 5 (KLF5) deficiency specific to bladder epithelial cells. KLF5 is expressed in proliferative epithelial cell types during embryogenesis. Results provide insight into the role of KLF5 in the development of the bladder urothelium.
