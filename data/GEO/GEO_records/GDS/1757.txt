TITLE
Diurnal cycle effect in leaves: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Col-0 leaves at various time points in a normal day-night cycle. Col-0 plants grown in 12-hour light 12-hour dark rhythm at 20 degrees C. Leaves collected 4, 8, and 12 h into the light period and into the night. Results identify genes that undergo diurnal changes of expression.
