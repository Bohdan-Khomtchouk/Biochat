TITLE
Left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of progressive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) males at 12, 16, and 20 months of age. LVH impairs diastolic relaxation, which decreases cardiac output and leads to heart failure (HF). Provides insight into pathogenesis of hypertrophy and LV remodeling.
