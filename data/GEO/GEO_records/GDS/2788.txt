TITLE
LIM-only protein 4 induction effect on breast cancer cell line (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MCF-7 cells following the induction of expression of nuclear LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4). LMO4 is upregulated in breast cancer. Results provide insight into the role of LMO4 in promoting tumor formation.
