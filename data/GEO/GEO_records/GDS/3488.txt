TITLE
Adipose tissue response to dihydrotestosterone: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retroperitoneal adipose tissue samples from gonadectomized males and females following treatment with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for up to 24 hours. Results provide insight into the role of DHT in the adipogenesis that occurs in retroperitoneal adipose tissues.
