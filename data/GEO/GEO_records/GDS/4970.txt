TITLE
CD138- and CD138+ FACS-sorted myeloma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD138+ and CD138− cells isolated from 2 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. The CD138- cells have greater clonogenic potential than the CD138+ plasma cells and exhibit stem cell properties. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the CD138- clonogenic population.
