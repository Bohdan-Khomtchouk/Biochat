TITLE
Parathyroid hormone-related protein knockdown effect on breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells depleted for parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) using siRNA. PTHrP affects the proliferative and invasive activities of breast cancer cells and regulates their sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Results identify PTHrP-regulated tumor-relevant genes.
