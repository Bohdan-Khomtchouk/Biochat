TITLE
Edelfosine effect on unstimulated CD4+ T cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of unstimulated CD4+ T cells (derived from buffy coat PBMCs) treated with edelfosine at 3.3 or 10 µg/ml. Edelfosine is a cytotoxic drug taken up by highly proliferating cells such as activated immune cells. Results provide insight into molecular basis of edelfosine action in immune Tcells.
