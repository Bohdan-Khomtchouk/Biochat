TITLE
TCDD effect on regenerating fin: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposed caudal fins at various time points up to 5 days post amputation. TCDD prevents caudal fin regeneration. Results provide insight into the pathways required for fin regeneration and the mechanisms of TCDD toxicity.
