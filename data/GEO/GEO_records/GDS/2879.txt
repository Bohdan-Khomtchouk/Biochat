TITLE
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli response to epinephrine, norepinephrine, and indole

SUMMARY
Analysis of enterohemmorhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 treated with epinephrine (EP), norepinephrine (NE), and indole. During infection in the gastrointestinal tract, EHEC is exposed to a wide range of signaling molecules such as EP and NE, and bacterial signaling molecules such as indole.
