TITLE
Bleomycin effect on lungs: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Comparison of lungs from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains, 3 and 6 weeks after treatment with 80, 100, or 125 units of bleomycin/kg. C57BL/6Js are susceptible to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, while C3H/HeJs are resistant. Results identify candidate genes underlying fibrosis susceptibility.
