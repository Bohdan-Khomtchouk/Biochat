TITLE
GH/IGF-1 signaling disruption and caloric restriction additive effect

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling defective Ames dwarfs (DF) subjected to caloric restriction (CR). DF and CR in combination additively extend life span. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying this additive effect.
