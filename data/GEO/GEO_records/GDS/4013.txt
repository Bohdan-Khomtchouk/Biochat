TITLE
High-fat diet effect on hepatic steatosis: liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver of C57Bl/6 mice chronically fed a high-fat diet for 21 weeks to induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which is linked to obesity and diabetes. Results provide insight into the role of adipose tissue and liver interactions in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.
