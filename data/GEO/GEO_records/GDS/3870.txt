TITLE
Developmental Regulators BrlA and StuA deficiency effect on vegetative mycelium: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of mycelium from mutants defective in two central regulators of conidiation, transcription factors BrlA and StuA. Inactivation of stuA blocks both conidiation and penicillin V (PENV) production. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying penicillin biosynthesis.

ORGANISM
Penicillium chrysogenum
