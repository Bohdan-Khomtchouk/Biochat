TITLE
Protein kinase HIPK2 overexpression effect on Human Embryonic Kidney cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with homeo-domain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) and HIPK2-DN mutant. HIPK2 mediates renal fibrosis in 3 mouse models of renal fibrosis (Tg26, UUO, folic-acidinduced renal fibrosis). Results provide further insight into role of HIPK2 in kidney fibrosis.
