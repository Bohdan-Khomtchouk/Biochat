TITLE
Electrical stimulation in vivo effect on neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes in the presence of an inhibitor of contraction

SUMMARY
Analysis of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes subjected to electrical stimulation in the presence of blebbistatin to inhibit contraction. Results provide insight into electrical pulse-induced changes in gene expression in neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes independent of contraction.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
