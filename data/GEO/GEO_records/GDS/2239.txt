TITLE
Hepatitis C virus core protein effect on hepatocyte cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 hepatocytes following induction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein expression. HCV core protein is implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results provide insight into the molecular processes affected by the HCV core protein.
