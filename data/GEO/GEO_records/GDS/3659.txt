TITLE
Transcriptional regulator Fog2 knockout effect on adult heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart ventricles of 6-week-old animals deficient for zinc finger transcriptional regulator FOG2 (friend of Gata 2, also known as ZFPM2). Fog2-null adults have severely depressed ventricular function and die at 8-14 weeks. Results provide insight into the role of Fog2 in the adult heart.
