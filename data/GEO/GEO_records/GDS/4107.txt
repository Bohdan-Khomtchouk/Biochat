KUCaP-2 xenograft model of castration-resistant prostate cancer: various stages

SUMMARY
Analysis of KUCaP-2 xenograft tissues transplanted into mice and collected during androgen-dependent growth (AD), castration-induced regression nadir (ND), and castration-resistant regrowth (CR) stages. Results provide insight into molecular basis of castration-resistant prostate cancer development.
