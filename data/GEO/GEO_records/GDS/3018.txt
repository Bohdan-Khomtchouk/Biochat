TITLE
Cardiac hypertrophy to overt heart failure transition model

SUMMARY
Analysis of left ventricle (LV) biopsies of hypertrophic hearts from homozygous hypertensive transgenics TGR(mRen-2) 27 (Ren-2) that either progressed to heart failure (HF) or remained compensated. Results provide insight into molecular changes that occur during the hypertrophy-to-HF transition.
