TITLE
1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D effect on prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of RWPE1 cells, an immortalized, non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line, treated with 1,25(OH)2D (i.e., the active form of vitamin D), for up to 48 hrs. RWPE1 cells are growth arrested by 1,25(OH)2D. Results provide insight into the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer prevention.
