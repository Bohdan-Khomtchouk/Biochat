TITLE
Endothelial cell response to estradiol in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with 1 nmol/L estradiol for 24 hours. The incidence of coronary heart disease in women increases after menopause. Results provide insight into the response of the cardiovascular system to estrogens at the molecular level.
