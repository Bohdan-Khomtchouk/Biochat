TITLE
Resistance exercise effect on MHC I and MHC IIa muscle fibers of young and old women

SUMMARY
Analysis of slow-twitch MHC I and fast-twitch MHC IIa muscle fibers from young and old women before and after 12 weeks of progressive resistance training. Fibers obtained from vastus lateralis. Results provide insight into the molecular adaptation of young and old MHC I and IIa fibers to exercise.
