TITLE
Adult and juvenile streptozocin-induced diabetic littermates: kidney cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of cortex from adult and juvenile Sprague-Dawley males 6 weeks after injection of STZ to induce diabetes. Puberty unmasks or accelerates the diabetic nephropathy. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying pubertal acceleration or unmasking of kidney disease in diabetes.
