TITLE
Neuromedin U effect on type-2 Th cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of type-2 Th cell line D10.G4.1 after treatment with 10 nM neuromedin U (NmU) for various times up to 12 hours. NmU is a neuropeptide that binds to its receptor on D10.G4.1 cells, eliciting the release of cytokines. This effect suggests a role for NmU in immune response and inflammation.
