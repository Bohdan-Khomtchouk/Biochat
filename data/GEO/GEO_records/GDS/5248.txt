TITLE
KSR2 deficiency effect on white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissues of mutants lacking the kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). KSR2 functions as a molecular scaffold to regulate the MAP kinases ERK1/2. Result provide insight into the role of KSR2 in white adipose tissues.
