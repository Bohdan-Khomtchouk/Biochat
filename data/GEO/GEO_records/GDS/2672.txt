TITLE
Embryonic V6.5 stem cell differentiation in vitro (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of V6.5 embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies in vitro. Cells examined at various time points up to 14 days after inducing differentiation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that drive embryonic stem cell differentiation.
