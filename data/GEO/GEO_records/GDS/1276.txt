TITLE
Inflammatory lung injury and mechanical ventilation

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of C57BL/6 based model of lung inflammation and injury. The model develops acute lung injury (ALI) after concurrent exposure to low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mechanical ventilation (MV). MV may contribute to ALI in critically ill patients.
