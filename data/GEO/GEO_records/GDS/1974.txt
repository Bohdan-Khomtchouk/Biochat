TITLE
Keratinocyte response to GLI1 and GLI2 induction: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocyte HaCaT cells at 24 and 72 hours following induction of GLI1 or a constitutively active form of GLI2 from a tetracycline inducible promoter. GLI transcription factors mediate the hedgehog signal in development and carcinogenesis.

ORGANISM
