TITLE
Stress factor RpoS regulon in exponential-phase bacteria

SUMMARY
Analysis of rpoS knockout mutants of bacteria K-12 strain MG1655 cells in exponential phase. RpoS, an alternative sigma factor and a stress response regulator, is a major regulator of genes required for stationary phase adaptation. Results provide insight into the role of RpoS in exponential phase.
