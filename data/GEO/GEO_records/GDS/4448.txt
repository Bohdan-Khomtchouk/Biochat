TITLE
Large RS-like factor SON knockdown effect in HeLa cervical cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HeLa cells depleted of SON, a large Ser/Arg (SR)-related protein localized in nuclear speckles. SON depletion severely impairs spindle pole separation, microtubule dynamics, and genome integrity. Results provide insight into the role of SON in cell-cycle progression.
