TITLE
Late passage LNCaP prostate tumor cells treated with androgen receptor shRNA or androgen R1881

SUMMARY
Analysis of late passage (LP50) LNCaP cells treated with AR shRNA or control shRNA, grown in hormone-free media to deplete androgen, and treated with androgen R1881 or vehicle. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying acquired androgen independence of late passage LNCaP cells.
