TITLE
Salinity stress effect on seedling shoot tissues: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of shoot tissue from 17-day-old Morex seedlings subjected to salinity stress. Gene expression in shoot tissue examined following exposure to 100 mM NaCl at various lengths of time up to 27 hours. Results provide insight into the ion-specific effects of salinity on gene expression.

ORGANISM
