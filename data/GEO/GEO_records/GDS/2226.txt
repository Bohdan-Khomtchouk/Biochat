TITLE
Hippocampus of various inbred strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi from 8 inbred strains. The hippocampus is a key area of the brain involved in behaviors such as learning, memory, anxiety, and aggression. Results provide insight into strain-specific gene expression differences and their relationship to phenotypic variables such as behavior.
