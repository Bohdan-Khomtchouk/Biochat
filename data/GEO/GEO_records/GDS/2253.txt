TITLE
Mammary epithelial stem cells (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of mammary stem cells, colony-forming progenitor cells and myoepithelial cells. Data reveal that the molecular features of stem cells are intermediate between progenitor and myoepithelial cells, and may provide insight into mammary stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

ORGANISM
