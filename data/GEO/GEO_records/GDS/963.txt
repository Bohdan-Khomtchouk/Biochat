TITLE
Macular degeneration and dermal fibroblast response to sublethal oxidative stress

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of dermal fibroblasts from patients with macular degeneration.  Fibroblasts subjected to sublethal oxidative stress.  This study tests the hypothesis that patients with macular degeneration have an abnormal response to cellular injury in sites other than the eye.
