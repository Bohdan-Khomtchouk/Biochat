TITLE
Heart atrium and ventricle

SUMMARY
Comparison of heart atrial appendages and ventricular free walls. Unlike ventricular muscle cells, atrial muscle cells produce the hormones atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this phenotypic difference.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
