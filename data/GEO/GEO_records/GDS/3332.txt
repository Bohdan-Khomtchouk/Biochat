TITLE
Wine fermentation effect on yeast: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain Vin13, subjected to ethanol levels up to 10% during a 15-day wine fermentation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response of yeast to the long-term environmental stresses present during alcoholic fermentation.
