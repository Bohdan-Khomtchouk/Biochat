TITLE
Melanocyte to melanoma transformation

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of normal melanocytes, primary melanoma cells, and metastatic melanoma cells. Results provide insight into changes in advanced melanoma relative to normal melanocytes and reveal new targets that can be used in assessing prognosis, staging, and therapy of melanoma patients.
