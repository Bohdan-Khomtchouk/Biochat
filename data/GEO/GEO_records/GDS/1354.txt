TITLE
Cirrhosis and liver endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver endothelial cells (LECs) from male Wistars exposed to carbon tetrachloride to induce cirrhosis. Studies suggest that LECs play a role in the decrease of hepatic vascular compliance in cirrhosis. Results identify endothelial-specific pathways for therapeutic targeting.
