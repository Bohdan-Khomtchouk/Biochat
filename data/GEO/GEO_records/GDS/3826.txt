TITLE
SP-C/c-raf transgenic model of lung cancer: adenocarcinomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung tumor cells and transgenic but morphologically unaltered lung cells, both harvested from SP-C/c-raf transgenics. Normal lung from non-transgenic littermates also examined. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from lung dysplasia to cancer.
