TITLE
Histone demethylase KDM3A-deficiency effect on estrogen-stimulated breast cancer cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 depleted for KDM3A (histone lysine demethylase 3A) then treated with estrogen. Histone lysine methylation is an important regulator of transcription. Results provide insight into role of KDM3A in ER signaling in breast cancer.
