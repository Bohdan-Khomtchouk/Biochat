TITLE
Ethanol effect on heads

SUMMARY
Analysis of heads from animals exposed to 50% ethanol vapor for 40 minutes once or five times. The multiple treatments were interspersed with exposures to 10% ethanol vapor. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fast and chronic ethanol tolerance.

ORGANISM
