TITLE
Reflux-induced esophageal cancer model

SUMMARY
Analysis of three rodent carcinoma cell lines established from two biliary reflux-associated tumors. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is associated with the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Results identify upregulation of several cancer-related genes important in human esophageal cancer.

ORGANISM
