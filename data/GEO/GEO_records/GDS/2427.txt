TITLE
Arginine regulon repression and derepression

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells with the arginine (Arg) regulon fully or partially repressed, or derepressed. Genes of the Arg regulon are coordinately repressed by the Arg repressor (ArgR) in response to Arg. Results provide insight into ArgR-mediated repression of arginine biosynthesis and uptake genes.
