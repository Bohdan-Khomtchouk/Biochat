TITLE
Respiratory burst oxidase homologs effect on wound responsiveness

SUMMARY
Analysis of systemic leaves from mutant plants with antisense-mediated reduction in respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rboh) activity. Rboh are homologs of gp91phox, the catalytic subunit of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase. Results provide insight into the role of Rboh in the wound response.

ORGANISM
