TITLE
CD4CD45Rbhi T-cell transfer colitis model: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of colon tissue from RAG-1-/- C57BL/6 males injected with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells from healthy wild type C57BL/6 males to induce colitis. T cells critically regulate clinical inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of colitis development.
