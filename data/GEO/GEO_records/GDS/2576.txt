TITLE
Microgravity effect on osteoblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2T3 osteoblasts following 3 days of simulated microgravity using the rotating wall vessel (RWV). Weightlessness or microgravity of spaceflight induces bone loss due in part to decreased bone formation. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating bone formation.
