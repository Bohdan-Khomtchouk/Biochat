TITLE
Auxin response transcription factor ARF6 and ARF8 mutations effect on flower development

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutant flowers heterozygous for arf6 but homozygous for arf8, and mutants double homozygous for both arf6 and arf8. Mutants examined at various stages of development. ARF6 and ARF8 are auxin response factors that coordinate the transition from immature to mature fertile flowers.
