TITLE
Female reproductive tract response to male-derived molecules and sperm: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the reproductive tracts of females up to 24 hours after mating. Male-derived accessory gland proteins transferred to females during mating affect reproductive physiology. Results provide insight into the response of female reproductive tissues to male-derived molecules and sperm.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL72 : [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
