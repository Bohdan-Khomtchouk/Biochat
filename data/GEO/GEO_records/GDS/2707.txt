TITLE
Neuralized embryoid bodies response to Hedgehog agonist

SUMMARY
Analysis of neuralized embryoid bodies (EBs) treated with a Hedgehog (Hh) agonist. EBs neuralized with retinoic acid. Hh signaling is mediated by Ci/Gli zinc finger domain-containing transcription regulators. Results used to identify gene targets of Gli.
