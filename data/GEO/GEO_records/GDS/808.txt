TITLE
Heart ischemia protection: comparison of pharmacologic and ischemic preconditioning

SUMMARY
Comparison of Wistar heart left ventricles preconditioned against ischemia by pharmacologic treatment with isoflurane to those preconditioned by exposure to sublethal ischemia.   Expression profiles examined in preconditioned hearts either perfused alone or subjected to ischemia and then reperfused.

ORGANISM
