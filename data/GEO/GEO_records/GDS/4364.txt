TITLE
Natural and induced Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and Foxp3-deficient induced regulatory T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of 3 subsets of sorted Tregs: natural (nTreg), induced (iTreg), and iTregs that lost Foxp3 expression (ex-iTreg), from spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes of BALB/c Rag1-/- mice treated with WT nTregs and WT iTregs. Results provide insight into molecular relationships among the Treg subsets.
