TITLE
Proapoptotic BH3-only protein Nix deficiency effect on the spleen

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleens of mutants lacking Nix, a proapoptotic BH3-only factor that is transcriptionally induced during erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis requires a critical balance between proapoptotic and antipaoptotic pathways. Results provide insight into the role of Nix in erythropoiesis.
