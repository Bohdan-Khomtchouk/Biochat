TITLE
FG-3019/gemcitabine combined-treatment effect on KPC model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of PDA tumors isolated from KPC (LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre) mice after combined treatment with FG-3019 (a mAb directed against CTGF) and chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the enhanced anti-PDA activity of FG-3019/gemcitabine.
