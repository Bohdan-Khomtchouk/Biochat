TITLE
Head muscle progenitors and trunk muscle progenitors: developmental time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) myogenic progenitors and trunk myogenic progenitors from E9.5 - E11.5 embryos. During embryogenesis, certain heart and craniofacial muscles arise from PM progenitors. Results provide insight into role of PM regulatory network in myogenesis and cardiogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
