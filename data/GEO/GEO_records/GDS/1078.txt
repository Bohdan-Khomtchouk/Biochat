TITLE
E2F-1 overexpression effect on melanoma cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of SKMEL-2 melanoma cells overexpressing the transcription factor E2F-1. E2F-1 overexpression induces apoptosis in many tumor cells. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying E2F-1 induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.
