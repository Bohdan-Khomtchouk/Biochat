TITLE
A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cell line with acquired platinum resistance

SUMMARY
Analysis of a cisplatin-resistant, A2780 cell line derived from parental (drug-sensitive) A2780 cells after 5 rounds of drug selection. Resistance to platinum (Pt)-based drugs occurs in the large majority of initially responsive tumors. Results provide insight into molecular basis of Pt resistance.
