TITLE
Multiple sclerosis patients with high serum semaphorin4A levels: peripheral blood cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood from MS patients with high or low serum levels of transmembrane-type semaphorin Sema4A. MS patients with high Sema4A levels have more severe disabilities and are unresponsive to IFN-β treatment. Results provide insight into role of Sema4A in the pathogenesis of MS.
