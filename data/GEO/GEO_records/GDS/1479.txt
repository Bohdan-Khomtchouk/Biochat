TITLE
Carcinoma in situ lesions of the urinary bladder

SUMMARY
Analysis of bladder biopsies of superficial transitional cell carcinomas with or without surrounding carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions and muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC). CIS is a common mTCC precursor. Results provide insight into which tumors in early stage bladder cancer are likely to progress.
