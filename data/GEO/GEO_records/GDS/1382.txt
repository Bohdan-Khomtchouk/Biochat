TITLE
mRNA translation and dehydration stress

SUMMARY
Evaluation of proportion of individual mRNAs in polysomal complexes in leaves under control and mild dehydration stress (DS) conditions. DS reduces level of mRNA in polysomes (ribosome loading) for most genes. Results suggest transcript sequence features that regulate differential mRNA translation.
