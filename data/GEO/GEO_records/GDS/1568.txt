TITLE
Fibroblast response to serum: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts at various time points up to 36 hours after serum stimulation. The fibroblast serum response represents a wound healing program; cancer progression is likened to wound healing gone awry. Results provide insight into the significance of the wound healing process in cancer.
