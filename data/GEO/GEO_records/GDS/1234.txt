TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 K650E mutation for type II thanatophoric dysplasia

SUMMARY
Analysis of PC12 cells expressing fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) K650E mutant responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) type II. Mutant receptor expressed as a chimera of FGFR3 and platelet derived growth factor receptor. Results provide insight into TD type II pathogenesis.
