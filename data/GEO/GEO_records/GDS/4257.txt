TITLE
Early lung immune response in tuberculosis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt)-infected lung 0 to 21 days after infection. TB immunity is associated with IFNγ lung T helper cell type 1 (Th1) accumulation and Mt-infected macrophage activation. Results provide insight into immune events that occur prior to Th1 accumulation in TB lung.
