TITLE
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) response to light damage

SUMMARY
Analysis of RPE from BALBc mice, exposed to 6000 lux cool white light for 1.5 h and allowed to recover for 24 hrs in the dark. RPE is the site of pathologic processes in many retinal disorders. Results provide insight into the molecular response to light damage of the RPE.
