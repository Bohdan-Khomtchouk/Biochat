TITLE
Raf kinase inhibitor 1 knockout effect on C57BL/6 pancreas

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas from Raf kinase inhibitor 1 (Rkip1) knockouts. Rkip1-/- mice exhibit a larger pancreas and increased beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content. Results provide insight into the role of Rkip1 in regulation of pancreatic beta cell function and proliferation.
