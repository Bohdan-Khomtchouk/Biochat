TITLE
Kidney epithelium cell line response to adaptive mutations in Influenza A virus (H3N2) non-structural 1 gene

SUMMARY
Analysis of M1 cells following infection with H3N2 human influenza isolate A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK-wt) or mouse-adapted (MA), recombinant HK NS1 mutants. NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of MA NS1 mutations on host gene expression.
