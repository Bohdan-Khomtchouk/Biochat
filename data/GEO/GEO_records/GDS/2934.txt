TITLE
PPARalpha deficient small intestine response to fasting

SUMMARY
Analysis of PPARalpha deficient small intestines after a 24 hour fast. PPARalpha is a fatty acid-activated transcription factor. Results provide insight into transport function and phase I/II metabolism in the small intestine during fasting and the role of PPARalpha in the response to fasting.
