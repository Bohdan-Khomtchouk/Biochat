TITLE
Leaf morphogenesis control by JAW microRNA

SUMMARY
Investigation of the molecular basis of jaw-D uneven leaf shape and curvature phenotype. Aerial parts of two week old jaw-d mutant and control plants examined. JAW microRNA guides mRNA cleavage of several TCP genes controlling leaf development.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
