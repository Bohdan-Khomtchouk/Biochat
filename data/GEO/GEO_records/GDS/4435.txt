TITLE
Serca2a effect on Dilated Cardiomyopathy iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of DCM iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes treated with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (Serca2a). Serca2a treatment improved the function of these cardiomyocytes. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Serca2a-mediated repair of DCM iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.
