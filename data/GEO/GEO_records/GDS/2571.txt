TITLE
Bone morphogenic protein 6 effect on an endothelial cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial cells treated for up to 24 hours with bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6). BMP proteins participate in the regulation of angiogenesis in physiological and pathological conditions. Results provide insight into the mechanisms that contribute to BMP-dependent angiogenic signaling.
