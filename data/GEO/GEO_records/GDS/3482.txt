TITLE
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis XIAP depletion effect on a colorectal cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of early and late passage HCT116 colon cancer cells depleted for X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). XIAP is overexpressed in the majority of NCI 60 cell lines compared to normal cells suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target in a wide spectrum of malignancies.
