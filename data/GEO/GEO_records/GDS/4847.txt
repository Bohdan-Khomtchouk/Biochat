TITLE
Chloroprene effect on mouse lung: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of B6C3F1 females exposed to 0 to 90 ppm chloroprene (CR) for 5 or 15 days. CR, a monomer used in the production of neoprene elastomers, generates multiorgan tumors in mouse and rat cancer bioassays. Compared to rats (GDS4848), B6C3F1 mice are sensitive to CR-induced lung tumors.
