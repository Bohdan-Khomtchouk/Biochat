TITLE
Titin mutation effect on embryonic muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of trunk and tail muscles of runzel (ruz) mutant embryos at 3.5 days post fertilization (dpf). Ruz mutants carry a mutation in the titin gene resulting in muscle degeneration and embryonic lethality. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of titin muscular dystrophy.
