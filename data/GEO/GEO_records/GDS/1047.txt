TITLE
Vernalization independence vip5 and vip6 mutants

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 3 week old vernalization independence (VIP) vip5 and vip6 mutants.  VIP genes repress flowering by activating the MADSbox gene FLC.  Results provide insight into the role of VIP genes in flowering and development.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
