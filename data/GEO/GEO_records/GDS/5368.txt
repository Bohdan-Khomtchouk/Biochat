TITLE
N-terminal truncated GATA1-mutant effect on fetal CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of fetal CD34+ HSPCs expressing N-terminal truncated GATA1-mutant (GATA1s) during myeloid differentiation for 4 and 14 days. GATA1s mutations are  associated with transient leukemia (TL)- in Down syndrome neonates. Results provide insight into the role of GATA1s in TL pathogenesis.
