TITLE
ERK MAP kinase inactivation during G0/G1 to S phase transition: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of NIH3T3 cells treated with the ERK inhibitor U0126 before or after the addition of the ERK activator FGF. Cells stimulated with FGF for up to 12 hours. Results identify genes regulated by the ERK pathway during G0/G1 to S phase transition.
