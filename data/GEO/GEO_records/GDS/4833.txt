TITLE
Cediranib effect on metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma

Analysis of metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) biopsies from patients treated with cediranib, a small-molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the substantial single-agent activity of cediranib on ASPS.
