TITLE
Transcription factor p63 inactivation effect on squamous cells (HG-U133B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of squamous cells following siRNA knockdown of the transcription factor p63, a homolog of the tumor suppressor p53. p63 encodes multiple isoforms that activate or repress transcription, and is critical for the development and maintenance of squamous epithelia.
