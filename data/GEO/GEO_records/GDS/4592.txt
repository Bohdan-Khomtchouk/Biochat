TITLE
Antiphospholipid antibody effect on first-trimester placental explants

SUMMARY
Analysis of first-trimester placenta explants treated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies are a maternal risk factor for preeclampsia. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying antiphospholipid antibody involvement in preeclampsia pathogenesis.
