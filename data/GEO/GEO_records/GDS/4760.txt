SUMMARY
Analysis of true interval breast cancers (TIBCs; tumors appearing after a negative screening mammogram) and mammogram screen-detected breast cancers (SDBCs). The development and progression of TIBCs differ from those of SDBCs. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TIBCs.
