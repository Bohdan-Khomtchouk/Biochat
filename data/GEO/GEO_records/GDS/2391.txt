TITLE
PGC-1alpha transcriptional coactivator null mutation effect on the brain striatum

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain striatum of PGC-1alpha transcriptional coactivator null mutants. PGC-1alpha regulates several metabolic processes. Altered energy metabolism is implicated in Huntington's disease (HD). Results provide insight into the role of PGC-1alpha in HD pathogenesis.
