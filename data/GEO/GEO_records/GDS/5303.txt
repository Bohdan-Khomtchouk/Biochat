TITLE
Transcription factor EB overexpression effect on brain hippocampus with an accumulation of mutant tau deposits

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi of Tg4510 animals overexpressing transcription factor EB (TFEB). Tg4510 animals, a model for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), express the P301L mutant microtubule-associated protein tau. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of TFEB on tauopathy diseases including AD.
