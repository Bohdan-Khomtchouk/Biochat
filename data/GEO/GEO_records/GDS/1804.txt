TITLE
Heat shock factor sigma32 overexpression: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cells at various time points up to 10 minutes following induction by IPTG of alternative sigma factor, sigma32, from an inducible promoter. Sigma32 mediates the heat shock response. Results identify genes regulated by sigma32.
