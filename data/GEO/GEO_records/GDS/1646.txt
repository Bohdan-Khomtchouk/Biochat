TITLE
HIV-1 burden effect on mononuclear cell response to co-infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with various titers of HIV-1 and exposed to a single infectious dose of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gc). Results provide insight into the role of viral burden in defining the cellular contribution to host immune response to co-infection with Gc.
