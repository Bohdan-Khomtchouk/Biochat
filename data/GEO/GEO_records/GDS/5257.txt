TITLE
Calyx of Held synaptic development: globular bushy cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of calyx of Held globular bushy cells at different maturation stages: P3, P8 and P21. Calyx of Held presynaptic terminals in the auditory brainstem develop into axosomatic synapses. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying development of mammalian synaptic structure and function.
