TITLE
Copper effect on liver cell line: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 liver cells treated with up to 600 uM copper sulfate for up to 24 hours. Copper is an essential trace element but can be extremely toxic at supraphysiological levels. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of copper toxicity.
