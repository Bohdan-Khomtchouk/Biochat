TITLE
Proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone effect on extravillous cytotrophoblasts in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of EVCTs isolated from first trimester placenta and treated with rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist. EVCT invasion into the uterus is critical for placental and fetal development. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PPARγ-mediated regulation of EVCT invasion in vitro.
