TITLE
Uterus response to 17beta-estradiol: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri of immature 19 to 20 day old Alpk:APfCD-1 females given a single injection of 400 ug/kg 17beta-estradiol (E2). Gene expression examined at various time points up to 72 hours following treatment. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying E2-induced uterine growth.
