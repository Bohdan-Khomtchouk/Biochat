TITLE
Alveolar macrophage response to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide exposure in vivo

SUMMARY
Analysis of alveolar macrophages purified from bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage after saline instillation into a lung segment followed by LPS instillation into the contralateral lung. Results provide insight into innate immune pathways activated in alveolar macrophages exposed to LPS in vivo.
