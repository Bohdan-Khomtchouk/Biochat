TITLE
Bar1-deficient mating type a cells response to alpha mating factor: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of mating response of W303 bar1delta a-type cells treated for up to 150 minutes with various concentrations of alpha mating factor pheromone. BAR1 encodes an aspartyl protease that cleaves the alpha factor to inactivate it. The alpha factor induces the cell cycle arrest during mating.
