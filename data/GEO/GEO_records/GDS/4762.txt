TITLE
Fibroblast response to coculture with basal breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts (HFF1, HFF2, Wi38, CCD1112Sk) and breast cancer epithelial cells (Cal51, MDA-MB-231) FACS-sorted from 6-day cocultures. Cancer-associated fibroblasts can promote tumor formation and growth. Results provide insight into tumor-fibroblast interactions involved in tumorigenicity.
