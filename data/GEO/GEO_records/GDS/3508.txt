TITLE
Hormone-sensitive lipase deficient liver response to a high fat diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) null mutants fed a high fat diet. Decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and elevation of plasma cholesterol are observed in this HSL-null animal model. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these features.
