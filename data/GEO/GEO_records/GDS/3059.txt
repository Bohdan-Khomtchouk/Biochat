TITLE
Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 response to methyl-tert-butyl ether

SUMMARY
Analysis of Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 cultures grown on methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or ethanol. M. petroleiphilum is an aerobic MTBE-degrading bacterium. The water pollutant MTBE is an additive that increases a fuel's oxygen content. Ethanol is an alternative oxygenate substituted for MTBE.
