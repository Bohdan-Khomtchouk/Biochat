TITLE
NCI60 cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of 60 cell lines (the NCI60) derived from tumors from a variety of tissues and organs. Such cell lines are used extensively as experimental models of neoplastic disease. Results identify variation in gene expression patterns in the cell lines and their relationships to tumors in vivo.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens
