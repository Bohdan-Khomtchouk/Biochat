TITLE
Aging and cognitive decline: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi from F344 males, at 5 age points across the adult lifespan, tested on the Morris water maze (MWM) task.  MWM is a dorsal hippocampal-dependent, spatial memory task. MWM performance showed an age effect. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of cognitive aging.
