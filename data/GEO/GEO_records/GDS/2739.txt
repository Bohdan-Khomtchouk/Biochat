TITLE
Hyperplastic enlarged lobular units: epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial cells isolated from hyperplastic enlarged lobular units (HELUs). HELUs arise from the enlargement of normal terminal duct lobular units by hyperplastic columnar epithelial cells and are the earliest histologically identifiable precursor of breast cancer.
