TITLE
Sevoflurane and propofol effect on the heart during off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery

SUMMARY
Analysis of atrial biopsies from patients receiving the anesthetic gas sevoflurane or the intravenous anesthetic propofol during off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Anesthetic gases protect against myocardial ischemia. Results provide insight into the basis of this protective effect.
