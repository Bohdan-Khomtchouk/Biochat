TITLE
Effect of ischemia and tissue procurement conditions on resected renal clear cell carcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of ten renal tumors that were resected then immediately frozen or stored at 4°C, 22°C, 37°C for up to 240 minutes. Results provide insight into the impact of tissue acquisition method on tumor gene expression profiles.
