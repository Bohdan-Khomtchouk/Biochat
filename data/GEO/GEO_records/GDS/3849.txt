TITLE
Hematopoietic differentiation model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Hoxa9-ER, an AML cell line created by transducing bone marrow with Hoxa9 fused to a modified ER ligand binding domain in the presence of tamoxifen (4-OHT), for up to 5 days post 4-OHT withdrawal which induces differentiation. Results provide insight into role of Hoxa9 in hematopoiesis.
