TITLE
Dendritic cell subpopulations: spleen (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of three dendritic cell (DC) subpopulations from BALB/c spleens: interferon-producing killer DCs (IKDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs), and conventional DCs (cDCs). Results identify IKDCs as a distinct DC lineage and provide insight into the role of IKDCs in linking innate and adaptive immunity.
