TITLE
Banded hedgehog effect on the pronephric nephron development

SUMMARY
Analysis of pronephric explants dissected from embryos previously injected with banded hedgehog mRNA. Hedgehog suppresses the development of the pronephric kidney tubule but not that of the pronephric glomus. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this inhibitory effect.

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis
