TITLE
Small airway epithelium response to cigarette smoking

SUMMARY
Analysis of small airway epithelial cells of phenotypically normal smokers. The earliest morphologic evidence of changes in the airways associated with chronic cigarette smoking is in the small airways. Results provide insight into how smoking modifies small airway structure and function.
