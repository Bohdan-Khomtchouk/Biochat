TITLE
Epidermal growth factor effect on HER2-overexpressing mammary epithelial MCF10A cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF10A and HER2-overexpressing MCF10A cells  grown on Matrigel in the absence or presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). MCF10A-HER2 cells exhibited autonomous growth, independent of growth factors. Results provide insight into molecular bases underlying the growth autonomy confer
