TITLE
Snail transcription factor/ERÎ± ligand-binding region chimeric protein effect on embryonic stem cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ESC line E14 expressing 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible Snai1-ER at various time points of induction with 4-OHT. Snai1 (Snail homolog 1) is a member of the Snail family of zinc finger transcription factors. Results provide insight into the role of Snai1 in ESC differentiation.
