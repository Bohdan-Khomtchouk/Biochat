TITLE
Segmental trisomy Ts1Cje model for Down syndrome

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of brain cerebella from Ts1Cje males at postnatal days 0, 15, and 30.  RNA pooled from 3 males at each developmental stage. Results provide insight into the molecular changes contributing to the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.
