TITLE
Ovarian germ line stem cell differentiation and reversion: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Dpp expanded germ line stem cells (GSCs) at various time points up to 50 hours following transient bam gene induction. GSCs differentiate into cystocytes 20 hours following bam induction. Cystocytes revert to GSCs 30 hours later. Results identify candidate GSC-specific genes.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

PLATFORM
GPL72 : [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
