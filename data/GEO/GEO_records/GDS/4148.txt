TITLE
Ataxin-1 deficiency effect on lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung of Atxn1-/- C57BL/6J mice at P6. Alveolarization defects causing air space enlargement were apparent in paralog of ATXN1 (ATAXIN1-Like) knockouts (Atxn1L-/-) at late alveolar stage (P17-23). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating the alveolarization defect.
