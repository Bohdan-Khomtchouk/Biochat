TITLE
Nucleotide excision repair mutant xpa-1

SUMMARY
Analysis of xpa-1 mutants deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Transcription-blocking DNA damage is believed to contribute to aging and underlie activation of oxidative stress responses (OSR). Results provide insight into the transcriptomic reprogramming response in xpa-1 mutants.

ORGANISM
