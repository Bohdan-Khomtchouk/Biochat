TITLE
Prolonged cardiothoracic surgery effect on diaphragm

SUMMARY
Analysis of paired diaphragm biopsies from 5 patients during cardiothoracic surgery: the 1st as soon as diaphragm was exposed, the 2nd as late in surgery as possible (4.9 ± 1.8 hrs between biopsies). Results provide insight into diaphragm muscle biology after prolonged cardiothoracic procedures.
