TITLE
Supercritical rosemary extract effect on SW620 colon cancer cells: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of adenocarcinoma derived-SW620 colon cancer cells treated with supercritical rosemary extract (RE-2) at doses of 30, 60 and 100 μg/mL. RE contains carnosic acid and carnosol (diterpenes) and essential oils. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of RE's anticancer effects.
