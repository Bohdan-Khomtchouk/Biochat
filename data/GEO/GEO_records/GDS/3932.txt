TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast response to forced expression of select transcription factors

SUMMARY
Analysis of motor neurons harvested from Hb9::GFP-transgenic E13.5 embryos, derived from Hb9 GFP ESCs, and made from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpression of 10 transcription factors (TF). Results provide insight into molecular basis of TF-mediated conversion of fibroblasts into motor neurons.
