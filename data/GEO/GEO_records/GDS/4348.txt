TITLE
Transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 deficiency effect on proximal small intestine

SUMMARY
Analysis of mature proximal small intestine with intestinal epithelium-specific pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) inactivation. Pdx1 is essential for regulating pancreatic development and maintaining proper islet function. Results provide insight into role of Pdx1 in duodenum.
