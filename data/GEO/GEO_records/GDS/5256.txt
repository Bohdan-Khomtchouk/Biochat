TITLE
Caveolin-1 deficiency effect on dexamethasone treatment: embryonic day E14.5 cerebral cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of E14.5 cerebral cortex, Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) deficient, cultured neurospheres treated with glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone (100nM, 4h). Cav-1 involved in GC signaling in neural stem cells. Results provide insight into role of Cav-1 in GC treatment and impact fetal brain development.
