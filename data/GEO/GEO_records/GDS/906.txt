TITLE
Bladder smooth muscle cell response to mechanical stretch

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cultured bladder smooth muscle cells subjected to repetitive mechanical stimulation for 4 hours.  Chronic overdistension results in bladder wall thickening, associated with loss of muscle contractility. Results identify genes whose expression is altered by mechanical stimuli.
