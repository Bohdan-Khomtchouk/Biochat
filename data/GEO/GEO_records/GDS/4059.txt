TITLE
Gamma-tocotrienol effect on breast cancer MCF-7 cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 cells treated with gamma-tocotrienol (γ-T3). Tocotrienols (T3s) inhibit the growth of various cancer cell lines without affecting normal cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of T3s on cell death and other growth inhibitory pathways.
