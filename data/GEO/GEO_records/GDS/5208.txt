TITLE
Dexamethasone effect on epidermal keratinocytes in vitro: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured epidermal keratinocytes treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone for up to 72 hours. GCs are used as therapeutic agents for skin conditions. Results provide insight into the molecular response of the epidermis to GCs.
