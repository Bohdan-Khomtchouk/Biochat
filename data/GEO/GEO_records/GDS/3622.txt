TITLE
Nrf2-deficient lung response to cigarette smoke: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from transcription factor Nrf2-deficient animals exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) at various doses and for various lengths of time with or without a subsequent recovery period. Results provide insight into the impact of Nrf2 in acute and subchronic smoking scenarios.
