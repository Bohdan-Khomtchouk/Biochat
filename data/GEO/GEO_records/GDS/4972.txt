TITLE
Laccaic acid effect on breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with laccaic acid A (LCA). LCA, a highly substituted anthraquinone natural product, is a small molecule inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). Results provide insight into the degree of selectiveness of LCA’s inhibitory activity on Dnmt1.
