TITLE
THP-1 macrophage-like cells response to W-Beijing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of macrophage-like THP-1 cell line infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) W-Beijing strains and H37Rv. Mtb W-Beijing sublineages are highly virulent, prevalent and genetically diverse. Results provide insight into host macrophage immune response to Mtb W-Beijing strains.
