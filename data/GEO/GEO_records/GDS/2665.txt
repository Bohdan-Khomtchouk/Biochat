TITLE
p53 mutant embryo response to radiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of p53 mutant embryos exposed to gamma radiation. Within 90 minutes of radiation exposure, apoptosis is observed in embryonic and post-embryonic tissues of wild type but not p53 mutants. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this p53-dependent apoptogenic response.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
