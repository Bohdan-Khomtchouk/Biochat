TITLE
TGF-beta effect on normal and tumor cell lines: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal lung epithelial HPL1D cells and lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells treated with TGF-beta for up to 12 hours. TGF-beta inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in normal epithelial cells but acts as a pro-tumor cytokine by promoting tumour angiogenesis, immune-escape, and metastasis.
