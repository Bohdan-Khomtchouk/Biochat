TITLE
Imatinib mesylate effect on patient peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified (PTCL/NOS) cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of patient PTCL/NOS cells treated with imatinib mesylate (1uM, 6h). PTCL/NOS tumors are characterized by aberrant expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRA). Results provide insight into the molecular effects of inhibiting PDGFRA signaling by imatinib.
