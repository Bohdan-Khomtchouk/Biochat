TITLE
Bmi1 deficiency effect on lung cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary lung cells FACS-isolated from Bmi1 deficient mutants. BMI1, a member of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, is required for the self-renewal of adult stem cells. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the BMI1-dependent regulation of lung stem cell self-renewal.
