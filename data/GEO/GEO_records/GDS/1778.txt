TITLE
Alpha2-laminin deficient dy/dy model of muscular dystrophy: diaphragm

SUMMARY
Analysis of diaphragms of alpha2-laminin deficient dy/dy animals. Alpha-2 laminin is important in muscle cell attachment, and its deficiency underlies classical congenital muscular dystrophy. Results provide insight into the events that link alpha2-laminin deficiency with muscle fiber necrosis.

ORGANISM
