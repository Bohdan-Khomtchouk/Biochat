TITLE
Notch-on and Notch-off effects on T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CUTLL1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Notch1-dependent TLL cell line CUTLL1 treated with γ-secretase-inhibitor (GSI) to block Notch signaling, subjected to GSI washout to induce Notch1 reactivation, and incubated up to 4hr with translational inhibitor cycloheximide. Results provide insight into Notch1 function in TLL.
