TITLE
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor upf1 null mutant response to global transcription inhibition: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild type and mutant upf1 strains up to 60 minutes after treatment with 10 ug/ml thiolutin, a global transcription inhibitor. Upf1 is an RNA helicase required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Results identify genes with differential expression over time between the two strains.
