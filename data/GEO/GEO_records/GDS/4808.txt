TITLE
Glioblastoma cells response to Focal Adhesion Kinase Inhibitor Y15 and Temozolomide

SUMMARY
Analysis of DBTRG glioblastoma cells treated with FAK inhibitor Y15, and U87 glioblastoma cells treated with Y15 and chemotherapy drug temozolomide. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic inhibitory effect of Y15 and temozolomide on glioblastoma growth.
