SUMMARY
Analysis of male donor islets transplanted into streptozotocin-induced diabetic females then removed at pregnancy day 12.5. During pregnancy, the mother’s insulin demand increases to sustain fetal growth. Results provide insight into the molecular response of male beta cells during pregnancy.
