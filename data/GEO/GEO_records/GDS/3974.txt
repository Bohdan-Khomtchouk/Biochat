TITLE
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and renal and cardiac MSC-like cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and heart- and kidney-specific MSC-like cells. Both pluripotency and retention of organ-specific functional roles characterize MSC-like cells. Results provide insight into functional similarities/differences of organ-specific MSC-like cells.
