TITLE
CD14 cells from granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood: expression profile

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of CD14+ cells isolated from granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (G-PBMC). Cells collected from normal donors after 3 days of G-CSF stimulation. G-PBMCs may confer a survival advantage to allogeneic transplant recipients.
