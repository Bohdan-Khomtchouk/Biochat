TITLE
Islet amyloid polypeptide effect on pancreatic cell line: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of MIN6 pancreatic beta-cells treated for up to 24 hours with various concentrations of human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). IAPP aggregration contributes to the development of islet amyloidosis in type 2 diabetes. IAPP oligomers are associated with pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis.
