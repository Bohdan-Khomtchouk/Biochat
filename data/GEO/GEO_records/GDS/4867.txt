TITLE
T-cell factor 1-deficient thymic lymphoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of thymocytes collected from Tcf1-/- animals with thymic lymphoma. Tcf1-/- animals of similar age without tumors and Tcf1+/- animals were also examined. Tcf1 is a Wnt-responsive transcription factor. Results provide insight into the role of Tcf1 in the development of thymic lymphomas.
