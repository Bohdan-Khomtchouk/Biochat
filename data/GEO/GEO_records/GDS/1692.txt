TITLE
Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection effect on cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of LER cells up to 48 hours after infection with oncogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A.t.). Unlike all known bacterial phytopathogens, broadly-infectious A.t. lacks the hypersensitive response-inducing HRP genes. Results identify the host transcriptional response to this unusual pathogen.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
