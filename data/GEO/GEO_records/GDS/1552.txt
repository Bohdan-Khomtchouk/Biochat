SUMMARY
Analysis of 10 clinical isolates and 2 laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Intraspecies genetic diversity is important in the pathogenicity and epidemiology of several pathogens. Results provide insight into the variability in gene expression among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.
