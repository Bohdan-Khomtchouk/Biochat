TITLE
Formaldehyde effect on nasal epithelium: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of nasal epithelia exposed to various doses of the carcinogenic pollutant formaldehyde for up to 19 days. Results used as a case study to validate a method that integrates benchmark dose calculations with gene ontology analysis to examine genomic dose-response data.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
