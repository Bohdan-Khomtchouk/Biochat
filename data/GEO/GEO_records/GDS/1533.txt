TITLE
Type 1 diabetes mellitus progression model

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreas of 3-week-old BDC2.5 transgenics that express a diabetogenic T cell receptor on the NOD or NOD.scid genetic background. BDC2.5/NOD has severe insulitis. BDC2.5/NOD.scid has severe insulitis and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Result provides insight into the pathogenesis of T1D.
