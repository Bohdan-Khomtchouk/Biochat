TITLE
Kras G12D heterozygous mutation effect on somatic cell line (Sentrix MouseRef-8)

SUMMARY
Analysis of MLP-29 liver cells bearing the heterozygous Kras G12D mutation. KRAS mutations are present at a high frequency in human cancers. Results identify a gene expression signature for the presence of the mutated Kras.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
