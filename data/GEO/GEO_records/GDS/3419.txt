TITLE
Endosperm and embryo fractions of developing and germinating seeds

SUMMARY
Analysis of pericarp, endosperm and embryo seed tissue fractions of developing and germinating grains. Plant seeds prepare for germination during the seed maturation stage. Results provide insight into the transcriptome relationships between seed maturation and germination.
