TITLE
Interleukin 17A effect on monocyte-derived dendritic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of in vitro-generated dendritic cells (DCs) cultured with interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in the absence or presence of interferon-γ. IL-17A is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases. Results provide insight into the impact of IL-17A on DCs and the role of these DCs in inflammatory disease.
