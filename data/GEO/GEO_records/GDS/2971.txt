TITLE
Hemiasterlin analog HTI-286 effect on docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of prostate cancer LNCaP cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel or the hemiasterlin analog HTI-286. Like docetaxel, HTI-286 disrupts microtubule dynamics. But unlike docetaxel, HT-286 exhibits reduced multidrug resistance.
