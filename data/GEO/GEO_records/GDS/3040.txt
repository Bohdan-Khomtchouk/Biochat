TITLE
Matrix metalloproteinase mutant airway epithelial cells response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured airway epithelial cells (AEC) from matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -7 or -10 mutants after P. aeruginosa infection. MMP-7 and MMP-10 are induced by acute P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Results provide insight into the roles of the MMPs in the host response to Pseudomonas.
