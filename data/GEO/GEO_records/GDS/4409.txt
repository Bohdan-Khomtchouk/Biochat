TITLE
Infantile-onset Pompe response to recombinant human lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) treatment: quadriceps

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps biopsies from infantile-onset Pompe disease patients treated with recombinant human lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA, Myozyme) for up to 52 weeks. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the response to therapy (positive vs. poor clinical outcome).
