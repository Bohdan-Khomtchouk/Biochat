TITLE
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced breast cancer model

SUMMARY
Analysis of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)- induced primary mammary tumors from Wistar-Furth females. Results compared to expression profiles of human breast carcinomas, and found similar to profiles of ER-positive, low to intermediate grade breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

PLATFORM
