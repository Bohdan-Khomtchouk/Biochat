TITLE
Glucagon effect on hepatocytes deficient in lysine acetyltransferase 2B or WD repeat-containing protein 5

SUMMARY
Analysis of C57BL6/J primary hepatocytes depleted of either lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B) or WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5) via shRNA knockdown, then stimulated with glucagon for 90 minutes. Results provide insight into the roles of KAT2B and WDR5 in hepatic gluconeogenesis.
