TITLE
Perforin 1 polymorphism effect on male patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) male patients carrying risk (GAA/AGA) or protective (AGA/AGA) perforin 1 (PRF1) haplotypes. Results provide insight into associations between PRF1 polymorphisms and male patients with MS, particularly male patients with PPMS.
