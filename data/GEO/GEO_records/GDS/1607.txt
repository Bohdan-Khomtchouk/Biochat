TITLE
Muscle glycogen content effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles of MGSKO and GSL30 lines which lack or over-accumulate muscle glycogen, respectively. Liver was also analyzed in MGSKO to assess whether muscle glycogen loss has indirect effects on liver. The two largest glycogen stores in mammals are in skeletal muscle and liver.
