TITLE
TATA-binding protein Spt15 mutant response to ethanol and glucose stress

SUMMARY
Analysis of spt15-300 mutant grown in conditions of ethanol and glucose stress. Mutant generated by global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) and bears 3 mutations in SPT15. Results provide insight into the applicability of gTME to alter cellular eukaryotic phenotypes.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
