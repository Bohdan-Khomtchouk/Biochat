TITLE
PGC-1alpha null brown adipocyte response to cAMP

SUMMARY
Analysis of PGC-1alpha null brown adipocytes treated with cAMP for 4 hours. PGC-1alpha is required for the thermogenic function of brown fat cells, and cAMP plays a role in thermogenesis. Results provide insight into the role of PGC-1alpha in the global transcriptional response to cAMP.
