SUMMARY
Analysis of five brain regions closely connected to the emotion-regulating parts of the limbic system, isolated by LCM from CD-1 males selectively bred for high (HAB), normal (NAB), or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety.
