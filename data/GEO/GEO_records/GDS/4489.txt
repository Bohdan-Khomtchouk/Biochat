TITLE
Turner syndrome amniocyte derived-induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monosomy X (Turner syndrome (TS)) amniocytes. TS derived-iPSCs facilitate modeling of aneuploidy-related abnormal early development. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying aneuploid syndromes.
