TITLE
Ischemic stroke: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs collected from ischemic stroke (IS) patients at least 6 months after the first and only stroke event. Stroke is a complex disease resulting from the interplay of environmental and genetic factors. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying IS etiology.
