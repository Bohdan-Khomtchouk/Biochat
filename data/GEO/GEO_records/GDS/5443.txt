TITLE
Human and chimpanzee TS12KOS vector-generated induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of chimpanzee iPSCs generated from blood cells using Sendai virus vector TS12KOS which carries reprogramming factors KLF4, OCT3/4, and SOX2. TS12KOS was also used to establish human iPSCs from fibroblasts. Results examine differentially expressed genes between human and chimpanzee iPSCs.
