TITLE
RNAlater preservative effect on uterine myometrium: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of uterine myometrial tissue specimens stored in RNAlater preservative for 24 or 74 hours at room temperature. Results indicate RNALater did not contribute any systematic shift in quantitative RNA expression results relative to alternative tissue processing methods (fresh, snap-frozen).
