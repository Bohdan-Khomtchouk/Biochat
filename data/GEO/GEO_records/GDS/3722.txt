TITLE
Activator protein-2gamma silencing effect on MCF-7 breast tumor cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 cells silenced for activator protein (AP)-2γ transcription factor using three distinct self-targeting sequences (AP-2γ siRNA1-3). AP-2γ overexpression in breast tumors is a predictor of poor outcome. Results provide further insight into the role of AP-2γ in breast carcinoma.
