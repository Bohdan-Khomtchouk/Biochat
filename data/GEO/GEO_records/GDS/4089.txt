TITLE
Proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells stimulated with bortezomib (velcade). Proteasome inhibition can regulate estrogen-induced transcription. Results provide insight into the mechanisms by which proteasome inhibition influences ERα function and may uncover improved strategies for the treatment of breast cancer.
