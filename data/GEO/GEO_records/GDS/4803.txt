TITLE
Interleukin-17A effect on primary airway smooth muscle cells from asthmatics

SUMMARY
Analysis of airway smooth muscle cells (ASM) from mild asthmatics after a 2hr interleukin-17A (IL-17A) treatment. IL-17A orchestrates airway inflammation by cooperating with and inducing proinflammatory cytokines. Results provide insight into immediate-early/primary response gene targets of IL-17A.
