TITLE
Cochlea response to mitochondrial DNA mutations

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochleas of animals carrying a mutator allele of the mitochondrial (mt) Polg DNA polymerase. Accumulation of mtDNA mutations is associated with age-related hearing loss. Results provide insight into the role of mtDNA mutations in the pathogenesis of age-related hearing loss.
