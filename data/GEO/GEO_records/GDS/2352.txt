TITLE
T cell receptor-independent basal signaling in unstimulated Jurkat T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of resting Jurkat T cells and derived mutants lacking T cell receptor (TCR) signaling proteins. Even without TCR engagement, the signaling pathways normally responsive to TCR are not inert. Results provide insight into the transcriptional consequences of the constitutive signaling pathway.
