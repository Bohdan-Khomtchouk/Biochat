TITLE
Pre-mRNA splicing factor sta1-1 mutant seedlings

SUMMARY
Analysis of sta1-1 seedlings mutant for the pre-mRNA splicing factor STABILIZED1. sta1-1 mutant identified in a screen for mutants with enhanced stability of the normally unstable luciferase transcript. Results identify endogenous genes with enhanced transcript stability in the sta1-1 mutant.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
