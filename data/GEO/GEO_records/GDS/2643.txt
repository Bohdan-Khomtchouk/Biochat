TITLE
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia: B lymphocytes and plasma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of B lymphocytes (BL) and plasma cells (PC) from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), a B-lymphoproliferative disorder (BLPD). Results provide insight into differences between PC and BL from WM and their cell counterpart in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma.
