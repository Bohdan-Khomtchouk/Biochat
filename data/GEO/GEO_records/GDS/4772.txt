TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of left ventricle (LV) from explanted hearts of male patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM is characterized by systolic contractile dysfunction of the cardiac chambers. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in LV function observed in DCM.
