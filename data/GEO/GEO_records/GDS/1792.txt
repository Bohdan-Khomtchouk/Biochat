TITLE
Gastric tubular adenoma and carcinoma

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastric tubular adenoma and carcinoma cells microdissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of gastric biopsies. Early lesions are small and detectable only with a microscope. Results indicate that routinely processed biopsy specimens may be useful in expression profiling.
