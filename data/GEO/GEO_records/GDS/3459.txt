TITLE
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions and progranulin mutations: various brain regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of various brain regions of patients who suffered from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U). Presence of progranulin (GRN) mutations determined. GRN mutations are associated with FTLD-U. Results identify expression signatures for GRN subtypes of FTLD-U.
