TITLE
High and low chromosomal instability phenotypes in stage II and III colorectal cancers

SUMMARY
Analysis of specimens from consecutive stage II and stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high or low chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype. CIN-high CRC showed poorer outcome than CIN-low CRC. Results provide insight into molecular biomarkers to distinguish between the CIN phenotypes.
