TITLE
Dioxin effect on breast cancer cell line (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 100 nM dioxin. Although dioxin is causative for many types of cancers, low exposure to dioxin is associated with a decreased incidence of breast carcinoma. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this protective effect.
