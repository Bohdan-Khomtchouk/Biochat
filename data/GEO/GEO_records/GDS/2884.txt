TITLE
X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy model and cardiomyopathy

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of mutants lacking EMD, a gene encoding an A-type lamin. Mutations in EMD cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of cardiomyopathy in X-linked EDMD.
