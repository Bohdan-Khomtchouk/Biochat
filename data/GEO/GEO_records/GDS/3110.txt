TITLE
Hypothalamic hamartoma and central precocious puberty

Analysis of hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) from patients with or without central precious puberty (CPP). HHs are congenital lesions composed of neurons and astroglia often associated with CPP. Results provide insight into the mechanisms that initiate normal puberty.
