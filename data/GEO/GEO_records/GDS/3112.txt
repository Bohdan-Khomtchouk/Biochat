TITLE
Hypoxia effect on cultured aortic smooth muscle cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of aortic smooth muscle cells incubated for 16 hrs or 48 hrs under hypoxic conditions (1% or 3%O2). Smooth muscle cell proliferation and survival are modulated by hypoxia. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying oxygen regulation of arterial smooth muscle cells.
