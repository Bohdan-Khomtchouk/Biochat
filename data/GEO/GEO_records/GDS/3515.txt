TITLE
Huntington's disease htt-171-82Q in vitro model: striatal neurons

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured primary striatal neurons expressing the N-terminal 171 residues of the Huntingtin protein along with 82 glutamine residues (htt-171-82Q), which is a pathological number of glutamines. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.
