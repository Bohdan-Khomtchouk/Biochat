TITLE
Dilated cardiomyopathy: left ventricle

SUMMARY
Comparison of subendocardial left ventricular tissue samples from 7 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) to those from 5 patients with non-failing (NF) hearts. DCM is a common cause of heart failure. Results contribute to the identification of a gene expression signature for DCM.
