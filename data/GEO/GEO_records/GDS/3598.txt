TITLE
p300 genetic reduction model of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hippocampi from heterozygous p300 deletion animals. A small percentage of cases of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is caused by p300 mutations. Results provide insight in the contribution of p300 to RSTS pathoetiology.
