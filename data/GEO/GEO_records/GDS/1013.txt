TITLE
IFH1 overexpression: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of overexpression of essential ribosomal protein activator IFH1. Cells engineered to express IFH1 from a galactose inducible promoter. Expression examined at various time points up to 60 minutes following galactose addition.  Results indicate that IFH1 regulates ribosomal protein genes.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
