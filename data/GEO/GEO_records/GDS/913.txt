TITLE
DNA damage from ultraviolet and ionizing radiation effect on peripheral blood lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to ultraviolet (10 J/m^2) or ionizing radiation (5 Gy). Lymphocytes obtained from 15 healthy individuals from ages 21 to 36 years and immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus. Results provide insight into transcriptional response to DNA damage.
