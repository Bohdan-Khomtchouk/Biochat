TITLE
Glucose effect on young pancreatic islets: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of islets isolated from young animals and cultured at 3mM glucose (G3) for 10 hr (T0) and then challenged with 11mM glucose for 1 hr (T1) and 4 hr (T4). Islets cultured at G3 for 2 days were also examined. Results provide insight into the kinetics of molecular response of islets to glucose.
