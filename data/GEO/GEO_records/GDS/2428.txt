TITLE
DNA demethylation effect on glioblastoma cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of short-term cultured glioblastoma cells treated with 5-aza-dC to induce DNA demethylation. Glioblastoma cells derived from 3 independent primary glioblastomas. Results provide insight into the role of epigenetic alterations in glioblastoma gene inactivation.
