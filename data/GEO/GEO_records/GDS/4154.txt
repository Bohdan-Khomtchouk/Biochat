TITLE
Parkinson's disease: post-mortem medullary regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2 regions of PD medullas: dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV) and inferior olivary nucleus (ION). A functional magnetic resonance imaging variant was used to identify brainstem regions targeted by (DMNV) and resistant to (ION) PD. Results provide insight into molecular basis of PD.
