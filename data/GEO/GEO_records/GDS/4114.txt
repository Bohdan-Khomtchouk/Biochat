TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of stroma associated with prostate and breast invasive tumors. Stromal reaction (tumor-associated tissue remodeling) occurs in various cancers. Results provide insight into whether this stromal response is largely a generic phenomenon or whether it reflects tumor-specific properties.
