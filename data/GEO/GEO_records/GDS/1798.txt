TITLE
CBF3 and ABF3 overexpressing transgenic leaves tolerative response to drought

SUMMARY
Analysis of transgenic leaves from plants constitutively expressing Arabidopsis CBF3 or ABF3 following exposure to drought. CBF3 and ABF3 function in distinct stress-response pathways. Results demonstrate ectopic expression of CBF3 or ABF3 enhances stress tolerance.
