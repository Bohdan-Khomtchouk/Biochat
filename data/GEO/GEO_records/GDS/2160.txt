TITLE
CH1 domain deletions in p300 and CBP effect on hypoxic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypoxic fibroblasts bearing deletions in the CH1 domains of 1 allele of p300 and 2 alleles of CBP. CH1 domains interact with the C-TAD domain of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1a and -2a. Results provide insight into the role of CH1 domains in the hypoxia response.
