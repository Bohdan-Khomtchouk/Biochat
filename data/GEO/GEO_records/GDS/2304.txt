TITLE
Akt1 serine-threonine protein kinase activation effect on the heart (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts after acute or chronic induction of a transgenic Akt1 kinase. Acute activation results in reversible hypertrophy, while chronic activation induces transition to failure. Results provide insight into the mechanisms involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.
