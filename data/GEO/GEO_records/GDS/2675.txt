TITLE
Ecdysone receptor knockdown effect on larval metamorphosis

SUMMARY
Analysis of ecdysone receptor (EcR) depleted animals 4 hours before to 4 hours after the start of pupariation. EcR is part of receptor complex for 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), a hormone that triggers developmental transitions in insects. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulated by 20E.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
