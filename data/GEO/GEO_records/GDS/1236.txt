TITLE
Huntingtin exon 1 protein overexpression

SUMMARY
Analysis of Htt14A2.5 cell line expressing a truncated form of huntingtin (Htt) exon 1 protein controlled by a promoter inducible by ponasterone (PA). Expression examined 48 hours after treatment with 5 uM PA. Htt expression in Htt14A2.5 results in protein aggregation.

ORGANISM
