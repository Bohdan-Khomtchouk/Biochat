TITLE
Midshaft fracture effect on the proximal femoral growth plate: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of proximal femoral growth plate at various time points up to 6 weeks following midshaft fracture in 4 week-old Sprague-Dawley females. Growth plates from fractured femora and intact contralateral femora compared. Midshaft femoral fracture stimulates linear growth of the bone.
