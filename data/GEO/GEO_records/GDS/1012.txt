TITLE
Idiopathic and scleroderma-associated pulmonary fibrosis derived fibroblasts response to TGFbeta

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult lung fibroblasts treated with 4 ng/ml TGFbeta cytokine for 4 hours. Fibroblasts obtained from patients with idiopathic or scleroderma-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Results provide insight into the role of TGFbeta in pulmonary fibrosis.
