TITLE
SOCS3 inactivation effect on embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of embryonic stems (ES) cells deleted for SOCS3, a regulator of cytokine signaling. SOCS3 null ES cells derived from blastocysts of SOCS3 heterozygous mutants. Results provide insight into the role of SOCS3 in ES cell biology.
