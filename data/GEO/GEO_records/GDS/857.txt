TITLE
Corneal stromal cell differentiation

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cultured keratocyte, fibroblast, and myofibroblast cells of the corneal stroma. Cultured cells compared to cornea from adults and 10 day postnatals.  Keratocytes maintain the transparent corneal stroma, and upon injury differentiate into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
