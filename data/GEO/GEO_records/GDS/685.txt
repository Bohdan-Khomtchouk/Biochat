TITLE
YODA MAPKK inactivation and constitutive activation effect on stomata

SUMMARY
Examination of gene expression in 7 days post-germination seedlings with either an inactive or a constitutively active YODA MAPKK.  Inactivating YODA results in excess stomata, and constitutively activating YODA eliminates stomata.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

PLATFORM
