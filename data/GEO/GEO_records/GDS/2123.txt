TITLE
Brown fat cell response to PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta deficiency

SUMMARY
Analysis of brown fat cells lacking PGC-1alpha or both PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta. PGC-1alpha is required for the thermogenic function of brown fat cells, and PGC-1beta is the closest homolog of PGC-1alpha. Results provide insight into the specific roles of PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta in brown fat cells.
