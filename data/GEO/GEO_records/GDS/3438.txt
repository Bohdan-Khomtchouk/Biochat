TITLE
Budding yeast response to hypoxia

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type cells grown under reduced oxygen tension. Heme synthesis requires oxygen, and yeast grown anaerobically exhibit an increased uptake of hemin. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating heme uptake.
