TITLE
Angiopoietin-1 stimulation of vascular endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HUVECs upon Ang1 stimulation in the presence (confluent) or absence (sparse) of cell-cell contacts. The Ang1-Tie2 system is implicated in both vascular quiescence and angiogenesis. Results provide insight into Ang1 signalling in the presence or absence of cell-cell contacts.
