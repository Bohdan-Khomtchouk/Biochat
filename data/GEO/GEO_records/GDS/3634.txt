TITLE
miR-205 expression effect on prostate cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of DU145 prostate cancer cells with restored miR-205 expression. miR-205 expression is lower in prostate cancer cell lines than in normal cell lines, as well as in prostate tumors than in matched normal prostate tissues. Results provide insight into the role of miR-205 in prostate cancer.
