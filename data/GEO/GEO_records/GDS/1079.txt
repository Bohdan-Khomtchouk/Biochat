TITLE
Age effect on myoblast progenitors

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary myoblast progenitor (MP) cultures from 8 and 23 month old DBA/2JNIA females. MPs are responsible for the growth, repair, and maintenance of skeletal muscle. Results provide insight into age-related alterations in MP function that contribute to changes in muscle composition.
