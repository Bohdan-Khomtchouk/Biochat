TITLE
Macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of RAW264.7 macrophage cells exposed to 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 and 12 hours.  Macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS.  Results provide insight into trafficking and secretion of cytokines in macrophages.

ORGANISM
