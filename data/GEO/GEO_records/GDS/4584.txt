TITLE
Alveolar type I cells deficient in sterol-response element-binding proteins inhibitor Insig1/2

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung from Insig1/2Δ/Δ animals. Insig1/2Δ/Δ animals exhibit lung inflammation and airspace remodeling associated with lipid accumulation in alveolar type 2 cells. Results provide insight into role of SREBP in regulation of lipid metabolism in lung.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
