TITLE
Adenovirus and lentivirus vector effects on midbrain neuroprogenitor cell cultures: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of differentiated mNPC cultures transduced with three vectors: Helper-dependent (HD) human (HAd) and canine (CAV-2) adenoviruses and VSV-G-pseudotyped self-inactivating HIV-1 vector (LV). Results provide insight into the toxicogenomic profiles of these viral vectors in mNPCs.
