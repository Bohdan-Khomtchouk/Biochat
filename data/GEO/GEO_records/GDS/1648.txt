TITLE
Hypoxia effect on HIF-1 alpha null hepatocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) null mutant hepatocytes subjected to hypoxic conditions for 8 hours. The HIF-1alpha transcription factor is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Results provide insight into hepatocyte gene expression changes induced by short-term hypoxia.
