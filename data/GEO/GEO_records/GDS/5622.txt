TITLE
Myelodysplastic syndrome disorder: bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells from adult patients representing MDS subtypes RCMD (refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia) and RAEB (refractory anemia with excess blasts). Results provide insight into molecular changes in the BM microenvironment contributing to MDS.
