TITLE
Intermediate filament protein GFAP transgene overexpression effect on olfactory bulb: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of olfactory bulb of 23 day and 4 month old transgenics overexpressing human intermediate filament protein GFAP. GFAP missense mutations result in Alexander disease, a neurodegenerative disease. GFAP overexpression results in an encephalopathy similar to that resulting from GFAP mutations.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
