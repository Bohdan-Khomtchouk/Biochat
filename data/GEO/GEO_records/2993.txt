TITLE
Histone deacetylase 5 deficient nucleus accumbens response to cocaine

SUMMARY
Analysis of nuclei accumbens (NAc) from histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) mutants treated with cocaine for 7 days. The NAc is a major brain reward region; loss of HDAC5 causes hypersensitive responses to chronic cocaine. Results provide insight into the role of histone deacetylation in drug addiction.
