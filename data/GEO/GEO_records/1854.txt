TITLE
Postnatal day 7 and adult cerebellum: glycoconjugate expression profile

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebellums of postnatal day 7 (P7) and adult animals using an array focusing on glycoconjugates. P7 was chosen for comparison as many differentiation events are peaking at this time. Glycoconjugates are widely distributed throughout the CNS and play an essential role in its development.
