TITLE
Liver X receptor alpha increase effect on livers of LDLR knockouts fed a high-cholesterol high-fat diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of increasing liver X receptor (LXR) alpha in livers of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockouts fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. LXR alpha improves the serum lipid profile of LDLR nulls fed the unhealthy diet. Effect of T0901317, an LXR alpha agonist, examined.
