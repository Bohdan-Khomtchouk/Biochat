TITLE
MicroRNA miR159a overexpression effect on flower

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage 15 flowers from transgenics overexpressing miRNA miR159a. Most plant miRNAs have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their targets. However, targets with up to five mismatches exist. Results provide insight into the mechanistic basis of target recognition by plant miRNA.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
