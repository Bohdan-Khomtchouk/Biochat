TITLE
Nodal, Mixer, and Sox17 inactivation effect on gastrula stage embryo

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage 11 embryos inactivated for Nodal signaling, or depleted of Mixer or Sox17 proteins.  Microdissected animal caps and vegetal and equatorial regions of stage 11 embryos also examined. Nodal, Mixer, and Sox17 are key proteins of a pathway controlling endoderm formation.
