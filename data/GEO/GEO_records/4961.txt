TITLE
Claudin 18 deficiency effect on the lung

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of claudin 18 (C18) mutants. Claudin are constituents of epithelial and endothelial tight junctions that regulate paracellular permeability to ions and solutes. C18 is expressed in the lung alveolar epthelia (AE). Results provide insight into the role of C18 in AE barrier function.
