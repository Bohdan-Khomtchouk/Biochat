TITLE
Leptin deficiency effect on lungs

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mutants treated with saline or leptin. Leptin deficiency results in low lung volumes and an attenuated chemical control of breathing. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which leptin alters respiratory system structure and function.
