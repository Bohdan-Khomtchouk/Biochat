TITLE
Hematopoietic stem cell proliferation after 5-fluorouracil treatment: time course

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of bone marrow Sca+ SP hematopoeitic stem cells (HSC) and fetal liver HSCs of C57BL/6.  Bone marrow HSCs examined at various time points up to 30 days after treating mice with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil. Results identify signatures for quiescent and proliferating HSCs.
