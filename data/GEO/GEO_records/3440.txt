TITLE
Aortic endothelial cell response to dominant negative PPAR gamma expression in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured endothelial cells expressing the dominant negative V290M PPAR gamma mutant protein. PPAR gamma exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the vascular endothelium. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of PPAR gamma's protective action in the vasculature.
