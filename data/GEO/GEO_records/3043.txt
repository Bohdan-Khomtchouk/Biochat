TITLE
Imatinib effect on K562 leukemia cell line (II)

SUMMARY
Analysis of K562 leukemia cells treated with 1 uM imatinib for 24 hours. Imatinib is a highly selective and potent growth-inhibitor of BCR/ABL1 expressing cells such as K562. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying BCR/ABL1-mediated leukemogenesis.
