TITLE
Homeobox Lim1 mutant nephron-deficient kidneys

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic day 14.5 and 18.5 kidneys from Lim1 conditional mutants. Lim1 is a homoebox gene that is essential for nephrogenesis. The mutant is ablated for Lim1 in the metanephric mesenchyme, resulting in nephron deficient kidneys. Results identify genes expressed in developing nephrons.
