TITLE
Breast cancer formation in WAP-SVT/t transgenic animals

SUMMARY
Analysis of mammary gland segments from WAPâ€“SVT/t transgenic animals. These animals selectively synthesize the SV40 T/t antigen in mammary gland epithelial (ME) cells and develop breast cancer after the first lactation. Results provide insight into the role of SV40 T/t antigen in tumor formation.
