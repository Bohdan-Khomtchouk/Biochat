TITLE
Simian immune deficiency virus Nef protein expression effect on CD4+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Jurkat CD4+ T cells following induction of simian immune deficiency virus (SIV) Nef from an inducible promoter. The Nef protein is expressed early in HIV and SIV infections and plays a crucial role in disease progression. Results identify Nef-mediated changes in T cell gene expression.
