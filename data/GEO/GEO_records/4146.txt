TITLE
Subcutaneous Interferon-beta-1b treatment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (U133 B): peripheral mononuclear blood cells

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of PBMCs collected from 25 German relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients treated with recombinant interferon-beta-1b (rIFN-β-1b, 250 µg every other day) for 2 years. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of IFN-b action.
