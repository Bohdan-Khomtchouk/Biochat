TITLE
Ras-associated binding protein 3A mutations effect on brain cortices and hippocampi (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain cortices and hippocampi of ras-associated binding protein (Rab) 3A D77G point or knockout mutants. Rab3a is a neuronal GTP-binding protein that binds synaptic vesicles and regulates synaptic transmission. The D77G point mutant exhibits anomalies in circadian behavior.
