TITLE
Multiple myeloma cell lines with acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agent carfilzomib

SUMMARY
Analysis of proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz, after 1 week of growth in the absence of carfilzomib. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of proteasome inhibitor resistance in MM.
