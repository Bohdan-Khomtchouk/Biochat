TITLE
Fibroblast pseudopodia response to lysophosphatidic acid

SUMMARY
Analysis of pseudopodia from NIH/3T3 cells extending protrusions in response to LPA, a chemotactic stimulus. Asymmetric distribution of RNAs establishes polarity in multiple cell types. Results provide insight into RNAs that localize in cell protrusions in response to migratory stimuli.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
