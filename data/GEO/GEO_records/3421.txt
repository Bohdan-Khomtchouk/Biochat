TITLE
Frag1 cells response to ionic and non-ionic hyperosmotic stress

SUMMARY
Analysis of bacterial Frag1 cells subjected to ionic (NaCl) and non-ionic (sucrose) hyperosmotic stress (HS). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of osmotic adjustment to ionic and non-ionic osmotica.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
