TITLE
Silica-induced pulmonary toxicity: blood (part I)

SUMMARY
Analysis of blood samples from Fischer animals for up to 16 weeks following inhalation of crystalline silica at a concentration of 15 mg/m3, 6 h/day for 5 consecutive days. Results provide insight into the utility of blood gene expression profiling to detect pulmonary toxicity induced by silica.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
