TITLE
Zipper-interacting protein kinase deficiency effect on coronary artery smooth muscle cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells following knockdown of zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK). ZIPK is phosphorylated and activated by Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1). These results, together with those from GDS5659, provide further insight into ROCK1 and ZIPK functions.
