TITLE
3-Deazaneplanocin A effect on multiple myeloma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MM cell lines (KMS18, MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2) exposed to 500nM 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). DZNep potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in the NCI-H929 and MM.1S cell lines. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying DZNep-induced apoptosis in MM cells.
