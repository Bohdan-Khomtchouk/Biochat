TITLE
Spleen response to acute LCMV-Armstrong and persistent LCMV-Clone13 infections: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen infected with 2 strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. LCMV-Arm induces T-cell response that resolves infection within 10 days; LCMV-Cl13 induces persistent infection via immunosuppression. Results provide insight into molecular basis of virus-induced immunosuppression.
