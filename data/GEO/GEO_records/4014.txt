TITLE
Effect of mitochondrial and oxidative stress on neuroendocrine CRI-G1 cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of insulinoma cell line CRI-G1-RR and subclonal line CRI-G1-RS. CRI-G1-RS is more susceptible to cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins such as rotenone and more vulnerable to direct oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for this vulnerability.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
