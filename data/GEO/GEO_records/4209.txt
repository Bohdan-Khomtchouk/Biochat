TITLE
Anti-CD47 antibody dimer MABL (S-S diabody) effect on leukemia cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of MOLT-4 leukemia cells treated with 10 ug/mL anti-CD47 dimer MABL (S-S diabody). Cell surface antigen CD47 ligation induces apoptosis in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of CD47-mediated apoptosis in lymphoid malignant cells.
