TITLE
Caffeine effect: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells treated with a low dose of caffeine at 2 mM or a high one at 20 mM for 5 , 15, or 90 minutes. Caffeine is a natural purine analogue that elicits pleiotropic effects leading to cell death.  Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of caffeine.
