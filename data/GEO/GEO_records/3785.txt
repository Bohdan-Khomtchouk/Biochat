TITLE
Osteoarthritic chondrocytes and healthy mesenchymal stem cell during chondrogenic differentiation: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of chondrocytes from osteoarthritic knee joints and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow of healthy donors, grown in a pellet culture system under chondrogenic conditions. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying chondrogenic commitment of both cell types.
