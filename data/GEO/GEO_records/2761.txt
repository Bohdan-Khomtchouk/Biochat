TITLE
Hypoxia-inducible factor depletion (Human-6 BeadChip)

SUMMARY
Analysis of hypoxic MCF-7 breast cancer cells depleted for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, or both HIF alpha subunits. Results provide insight into the extent of the role of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia.
