TITLE
Chromosomally stable and unstable isogenic clone comparison

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 2 pools of chromosomally unstable Chinese hamster-human hybrid GM10115 clones referenced to an isogenic stable clone RT210B.  Clone Fe10-3 pooled with 10-56-11, and LS12 with 10-107-9. Chromosome instability induced by radiation.
