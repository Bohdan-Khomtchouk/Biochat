TITLE
Akt inhibitor MK2206 effect on influenza H1N1 infection of non-small cell lung cancer line

SUMMARY
Analysis of non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H1666 cells treated with MK2206 and infected with influenza A/Helsinki/P14/2009(pH1N1). MK2206 is an inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B). Results provide insight into the role of Akt signaling in pH1N1 infection.
