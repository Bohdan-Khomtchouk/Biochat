TITLE
Edelfosine effect on stimulated CD4+ T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of stimulated CD4+ T cells (derived from buffy coat PBMCs) treated with edelfosine at 3.3Âµg/ml. Edelfosine is a cytotoxic drug taken up by highly proliferating cells such as activated immune cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of edelfosine action in immune T cells.
