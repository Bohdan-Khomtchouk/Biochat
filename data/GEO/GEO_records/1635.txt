TITLE
Nodose and dorsal root ganglia comparison (MG-430 2.0)

SUMMARY
Analysis of laser-captured neurons of the nodose (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Vagal afferents arise from NG and convey mostly physiological information, while spinal afferents arise from DRG and transmit noxious signals. Results elucidate molecular identities for these different properties.
