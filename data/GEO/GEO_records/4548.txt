TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of colonic intestinal explants stimulated with PMA/IO to induce pro-inflammatory conditions then incubated with various commensal lactobacilli strains. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of probiotic attenuation of inflammatory processes in a colon organ culture model.
