TITLE
Eccentric exercise effect on skeletal muscle: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of vastus lateralis muscles of healthy subjects 3 and 48 hrs after a bout of resistance (RES) exercise of 300 single-leg maximal eccentric contractions (EC). EC is the lengthening of a muscle due to an external force while that muscle is contracting. EC commonly results in muscle damage.
