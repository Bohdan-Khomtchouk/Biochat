TITLE
p53 mutations in microsatellite-stable, stage III colorectal cancer

SUMMARY
Analysis of Stage III CRCs exhibiting microsatellite-stable (MSS) and mutant p53 phenotypic features. p53 mutations are associated with higher Stage III MSS CRC mortality than p53 wild-type phenotypes. Results provide further insight into the prognostic value of p53 mutations in Stage III MSS CRCs.
