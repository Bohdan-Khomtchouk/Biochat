TITLE
Vesicular acetylcholine transporter knockdown effect on heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT)-deficient C57BL/6 males. The VAChT KD animals have a systemic decrease in ACh release and cardiac dysfunction. Results provide insight into potential molecular changes in the heart induced by decreased cholinergic neurotransmission.
