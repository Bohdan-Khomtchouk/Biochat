TITLE
Matrigel 3D culture model of JIMT1 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of JIMT1 breast cancer cells cultured as xenografts, in two dimensional cultures, in polyHEMA three dimensional cell cultures, and in Matrigel three dimensional cell cultures. Results provide insight into how closely the Matrigel 3D cell culture model mimics in vivo tumors.
