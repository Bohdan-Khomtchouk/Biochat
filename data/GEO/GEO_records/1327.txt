TITLE
Lens epithelial and lens cortical fiber cell comparison

SUMMARY
Comparison of lens epithelial cells to lens cortical fiber cells. Cells microdissected from lenses of post mortem donors. Results identify genes that may play roles in maintaining the specialized functions of each cell type and provides insight into potential mechanisms of lens cell differentiation.
