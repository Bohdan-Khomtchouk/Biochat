TITLE
Rosiglitazone effect on PRDM16-deficient inguinal white adipose tissue: stromal-vascular cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of SV cells isolated from PRDM16-depleted inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) treated with rosiglitazone. Antidiabetic PPARÎ³ ligand drugs, such as rosiglitazone, activate a browning of WAT. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying white-to-brown fat conversion.
