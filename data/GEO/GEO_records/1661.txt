TITLE
Transcription factor Egr3 expression effect on primary myotubes (MG-430A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary myotubes expressing wild-type or inactive truncated Egr3. Transcription factor Egr3 activity is critical for the development of muscle spindles, skeletal muscle stretch receptors that mediate axial and limb proprioception.

ORGANISM
