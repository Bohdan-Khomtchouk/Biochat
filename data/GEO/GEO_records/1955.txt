TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 activation effect on mammary glands: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of mammary glands from transgenic animals treated with dimerizing agent AP20187 to activate inducible fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (iFGFR1). iFGFR1 dimerization induces proliferation in the mammary gland. Results provide insight into the early progression of tumorigenesis.
