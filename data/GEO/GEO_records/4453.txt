TITLE
Wild type embryonic tooth germ tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of laser capture microdissected tooth germ tissue from ICR E13.5 embryos and matched whole embryo body (WB, without tooth germ) controls representing stages E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying tooth development.
