TITLE
Succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency effect on the brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain hippocampi, cerebella, and cortices of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH)-deficient mutants at 3 weeks of age, when fatal seizures occur. Results indicate that SSADH deficiency results in the dysregulation of genes involved in myelin structure and compaction.
