TITLE
Auxin signaling inhibitors effect on seedlings

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of 7 day old Columbia-O seedlings treated for 1 hour with auxin and with either compound A or B. Both compounds identified in a screen for small chemical inhibitors of auxin signaling. Results provide insight into the regulation of the auxin-signaling network.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
