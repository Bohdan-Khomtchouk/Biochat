TITLE
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymph node matched samples

SUMMARY
Analysis of purified CLL cells from 24 treatment-naive patients. Samples were obtained concurrently from peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and/or lymph nodes (LN). Results provide insight into the role of the tissue microenvironment in the pathogenesis of CLL in vivo.
