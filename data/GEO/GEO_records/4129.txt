TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum stress effect on lymphoblastoid cells of unrelated individuals

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized B cells from 60 unrelated individuals (grandparents in the HapMap CEPH-Utah pedigrees) treated in vitro with tunicamycin to induce ER stress.  ER stress induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying UPR response.
