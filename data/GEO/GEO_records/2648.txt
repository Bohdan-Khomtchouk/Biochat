TITLE
Palmitate effect on myoblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of myoblasts treated with the saturated fatty acid palmitate. Muscle expression of PPAR coactivator 1 (PGC-1) is reduced in models of obesity. Palmitate decreases the expression of PGC-1. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the link between overnutrition, obesity, and PGC-1.
