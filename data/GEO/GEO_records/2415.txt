TITLE
Breast carcinomas and local recurrence

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary breast carcinoma tumors from 50 patients who received breast-conserving therapy (BCT). 19 patients subsequently developed a local recurrence of the carcinoma. 9 recurrent tumors also examined. Compared to mastectomy, BCT is associated with a higher rate of local recurrence.
