TITLE
Rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma comparison

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression in 12 pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) to that in 11 pediatric Ewing's sarcomas (EWS).   3 embryonic and 9 alveolar RMS tumors examined.  RMS and EWS appear similar in routine histology.  Results identify expression profiles that distinguish RMS from EWS.
