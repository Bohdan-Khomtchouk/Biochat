TITLE
Pluripotent embryonic stem cells and multipotent adult germline stem cells in 129SV and Stra8-EGFP/Rosa26-LacZ strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from different genetic backgrounds and under differentiation-promoting conditions. Results enable expression pattern comparisons between maGSCs and ESCs.
