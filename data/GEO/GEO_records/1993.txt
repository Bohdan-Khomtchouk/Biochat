TITLE
Colon carcinoma cell line differentiation: transporter and ion channel expression profile

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells cultured for various lengths of time up to 3 weeks in flasks or on filters. An array focusing on transporters and ion channels was used. Results provide insight into the influence of cell differentiation on the mRNA expression of transporters and channels.
