TITLE
Enigma mitochondrial protein knockdown

SUMMARY
Analysis of Kc-167 cells following knockdown of Enigma (Egm) using RNAi. Egm is a mitochondrial protein with homology to enzymes of the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the increased oxidative stress tolerance conferred by decreased Egm levels.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
