TITLE
Interleukin-13 effect on esophageal epithelial cells from eosinophilic esophagitis patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary esophageal epithelial cells from eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) patients following 100ng/mL interleukin-13 (IL-13) stimulation. The T-helper type 2 cytokine IL-13 plays a pivotal role in eosinophilic inflammation. Results provide insight into the role of IL-13 in EE pathogenesis.
