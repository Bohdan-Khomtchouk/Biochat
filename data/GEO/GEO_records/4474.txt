TITLE
U373MG glioblastoma cell line response to 3 anti-cancer 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids

SUMMARY
Analysis of U373MG glioblastoma cells treated 24 hrs with DMSO or IC50 concentrations of anti-cancer compounds ecteinascidin-770 (ET-770), ET-770 derivative (ET-770-DR) or renieramycin M (RM). Results provide insight into pathways responsible for cytotoxic effects of compounds on glioblastoma.
