TITLE
MYBL1 transcription factor knockout effect on testes

SUMMARY
Analysis of testis from 14 and 17 day old Mybl1 repro9/repro9 mutants. Mybl1 is highly transcribed in spermatocytes after meiotic entry. Repro9 mutants exhibit male infertility due to arrest of meiosis pachytene stage. Results provide insight in the role of MYBL1 in the regulation of male meiosis.
