TITLE
Photoreceptor cell mRNA purified by mRNA tagging

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA purified by mRNA-tagging from photoreceptors cells. These cells are engineered to express a FLAG-tagged poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) that allows separation of their mRNA from those of cells not expressing the tagged PABP. Results provide insight into the validity of this approach.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
