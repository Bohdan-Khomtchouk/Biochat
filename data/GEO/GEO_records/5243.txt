TITLE
Mmp-8 deficient ankle joint response to the induction of arthritis

SUMMARY
Analysis of ankle joints of Mmp-8 deficient mutants following treatment with sera from K/BxN mice to induce arthritis. Mmp-8 encodes a metalloproteinase. Results compared to arthritic ankles from wild type animals (GDS5244) and provide insight into the role of Mmp-8 in the pathogenesis of arthritis.
