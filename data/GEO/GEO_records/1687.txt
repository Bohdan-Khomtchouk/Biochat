TITLE
Low-shear modeled microgravity effect

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild type BY4743 cells grown in a low-shear modeled microgravity environment (LSMMG). LSMMG environment produced using a high aspect rotating vessel. Results provide insight into the response to the microgravity environment experienced during space flight.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe
