TITLE
Adriamycin in vitro effect on Eµ-myc transgenic lymphoma cells deficient in Suv39h1

SUMMARY
Analysis of lymphoma cells isolated from Eµ-myc mice deficient in H3K9 histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 and treated in vitro with anticancer drug ADR. ADR induces therapy-induced senescence (TIS) in Suv39h1-proficient lymphomas. Results provide insight into the impact of Suv39h1 on TIS induction.
