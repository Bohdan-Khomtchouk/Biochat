TITLE
PPARalpha deficient heart response to chronic pressure overload

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart left ventricles subjected to chronic pressure overload for 28 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy. PPARalpha mitigates cardiac hypertrophy. Results provide insight into processes and signalling pathways regulated by PPARalpha in hearts challenged by chronic pressure overload.
