TITLE
Keratin 6a+, K6-tva RCAS-PyMT transgenic model of breast cancer

SUMMARY
Analysis of RCAS-PyMT-induced mammary tumors from K6-tva and MMTV-tva transgenic FVB/N mice. Tumors in the K6a-tva line resemble the normal breast-like subtype of human breast cancer, offering a tool to study the evolution of normal-like breast cancer.
