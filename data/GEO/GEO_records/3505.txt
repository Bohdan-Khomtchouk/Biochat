TITLE
Seedling roots response to auxin and ethylene availability

SUMMARY
Analysis of roots of aux1-7 seedlings treated with ethylene (ETH) and those of ein2-5 seedlings with auxin. Aux1-7 roots are defective in auxin influx but resistant to ETH. Ein2-5 roots are insensitive to ETH but responsive to auxin.  Results provide insight into auxin and ETH interactions in roots.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
