TITLE
Inflammatory breast cancer cell line response to TIG1 depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of SUM149 inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cells depleted for TIG1. TIG1 depletion decreased IBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth of IBC cells in vivo. Results provide insight into the role of TIG1 in the pathogenesis and progression of IBC.
