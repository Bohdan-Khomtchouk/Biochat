TITLE
Myostatin depletion effect on mature skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of mature skeletal muscle depleted for the TBFb protein myostatin (MSTN). MSTN inhibits muscle differentiation and growth. MSTN deficiency during development results in muscle hypertrophy. Results provide insight into the effect of reducing MSTN activity after normal muscle development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
