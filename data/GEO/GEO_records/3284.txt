TITLE
Antimalarial drug chloroquine effect on PfCRT mutant parasite lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant transporter (PfCRT) mutants exposed to a low dose of chloroquine (CQ) for 3 h. The clones have different degrees of CQ resistance (CQR). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the PfCRT effect on parasite susceptibility to CQ.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
