TITLE
Dicer inactivation effect on the embryonic heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic day 11.5 hearts inactivated for Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease essential for processing of pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) into the mature form. The mutants died from cardiac failure by E12.5. Results provide insight into the role of miRNA function during cardiac development.
