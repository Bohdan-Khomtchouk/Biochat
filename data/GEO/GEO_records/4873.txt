TITLE
Hepatoma cell line overexpressing human Sar1 components of the coat protein complex II transport machinery

SUMMARY
Analysis of McArdle-RH7777 hepatoma cell lines overexpressing human SAR1A, SAR1B, or a constitutively active mutant SAR1B that cannot hydrolyze GTP to support coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicle assembly. Results provide insight into roles of the SAR1 isoforms in the COPII transport machinery.
