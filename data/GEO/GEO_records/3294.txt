TITLE
CTCF depletion effect in oocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes depleted for maternal stores of CTCF by RNA interference (RNAi). Depletion of CTCF, an 11 zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, causes meiotic defects in the egg. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this observation.
