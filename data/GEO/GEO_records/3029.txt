TITLE
Small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines of varying sensitivity to a Bcl-2 antagonist

SUMMARY
Analysis of small-cell lung carcinoma cell (SCLC) lines. Expression profiles compared to the cell lines' sensitivity to the Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-737 and chromosomal gains that include changes in Bcl-2 gene copy number. ABT-737 induces the regression of a fraction of SCLC solid tumors.
