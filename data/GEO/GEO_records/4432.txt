TITLE
Rough attenuated Brucella suis strain infection effect on macrophage cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of J774.A1 macrophage cells for up to 48 hours following infection with S1330-smooth virulent or VTRS1-rough attenuated Brucella suis strain. S1330 prevents macrophage cell death while VTRS1 induces it. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of VTRS1-induced macrophage cell death.
