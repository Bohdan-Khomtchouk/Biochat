TITLE
Graded HoxA10 expression effect on Lin(-) Sca1(+) c-kit(+) bone marrow cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HoxA10 transgenic Lin(-) Sca1(+) c-kit(+) bone marrow cells following treatment with 0, 0.1 or 0.5 ug/ml doxycycline. In this model, doxycycline induces the expression of HoxA10 in a dose dependent manner.  Results provide insight into the role of HoxA10 in early hematopoiesis.
