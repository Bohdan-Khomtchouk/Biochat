TITLE
Pancreatic islet response to glucose in vitro: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islets cultured for 18 hours in 2, 5, 10, or 30 mM glucose. Culture in 2 to 10 mM glucose improves beta cell survival and function, while concentrations above 10 mM are deleterious. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this sensitivity to glucose concentrations.
