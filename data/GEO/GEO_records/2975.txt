TITLE
TGF-beta 1 effect on immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized ovarian surface epithelial (IOSE) cells treated for up to 12 hours with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFb1). IOSE cells are derived from normal ovarian epithelial cells which, unlike ovarian cancer, respond to TGFb1-induced growth inhibition.
