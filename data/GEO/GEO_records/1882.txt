TITLE
Embryonic fibroblast-independent embryonic stem cell differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of CGR8 embryoid bodies differentiating for 3 or 10 days. Culturing of most embryonic stem (ES) cells require embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells which may affect their gene expression profiles. CGR8 cells are MEF-independent and represent a powerful model of ES cell differentiation.
