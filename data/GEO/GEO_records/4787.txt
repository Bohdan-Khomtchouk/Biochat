TITLE
Long non-coding RNA H19 depletion effect on myoblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts depleted for H19 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). H19 depletion causes precocious muscle differentiation in vitro, a phenotype recapitulated by let-7 overexpression. Results provide insight into a role for H19 as a regulator of let-7 microRNAs.
