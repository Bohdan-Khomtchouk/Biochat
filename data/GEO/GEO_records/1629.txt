TITLE
Immortalized suprachiasmatic nucleus cell line across circadian cycles: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) immortalized cell line SCN2.2 at 6 hour intervals over 2 circadian cycles. The master clock responsible for the regulation of circadian rhythms in the body is located in the SCN. Results indicate that SCN2.2 retains intrinsic rhythm-generating properties.

ORGANISM
