TITLE
Steady-state external pH effect on enteric bacteria

SUMMARY
Analysis of enteric bacteria K-12 strain W3110 cells grown aerobically and exposed to low, neutral, or high pH. Enteric bacteria encounter a wide range of external pHs in the human digestive tract, their natural habitat. Results provide insight into the acid and base response.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12
