TITLE
Brain hippocampal neurons response to brief preconditioning seizures

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of brain hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons of Sprague Dawleys subjected to brief preconditioning seizures. Dentate gyrus granule cells also examined. CA1 and CA3 neurons subjected to preconditioning seizures are less vulnerable to subsequent prolonged seizures.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
