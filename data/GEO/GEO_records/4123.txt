TITLE
Isoflavone and 3,3’-diindolylmethane effect on C4-2B prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of C4-2B prostate cancer (PCa) cells treated with isoflavone (IsoF) and 3,3’- diindolylmethane (B-DIM) for up to 72 hours. IsoF and B-DIM inhibited the signal transductions in PCa signaling. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying PCa growth.
