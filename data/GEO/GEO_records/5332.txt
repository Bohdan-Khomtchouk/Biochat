TITLE
Death receptor knockout effect on NEMO-deficient model of chronic liver disease

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers from hepatocyte-specific NF-Ä¸B essential modulator (NEMO), NEMO-TRIAL, and NEMO-TNFR null males. NEMO deletion in hepatocytes causes spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis. TNFR1 and TRAIL encode death receptors. Results provide insight into the role of death receptors in liver injury.
