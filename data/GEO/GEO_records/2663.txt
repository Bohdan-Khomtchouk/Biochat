TITLE
Mre11 deficient sporulating cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Mre11 deficient cells at meiotic prophase during sporulation. Mre11 is important in homologous recombination, repair of DNA double strand breaks, activation of damage-induced checkpoint, and telomere maintenance. Results provide insight into the role of Mre11 in spore development.

ORGANISM
