TITLE
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-deficient mutants on a very low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet: liver expression profile

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver from stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) deficient mutants maintained on a very low-fat, high-carbohydrate (VLF-HC) diet. SCD1-deficient mutants on VLF-HC develop severe hypercholesterolemia, have reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hepatic dysfunction.
