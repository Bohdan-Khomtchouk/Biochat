TITLE
Amyloid precursor protein double mutant and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 deficiency effects on adult brain regions

SUMMARY
Analysis of prefrontal cortices and hippocampi from C57BL/6 adults: APLP2-KO (APLP2-/-) or APPsα-DM (APPα/αAPLP2-/-). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and AP-like protein 2 (APLP2) play key roles in Alzheimer pathogenesis. Results provide mechanistic insights into APP/APLP2-mediated functions.
