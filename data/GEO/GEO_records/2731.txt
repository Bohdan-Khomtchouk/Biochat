TITLE
Retinoblastoma binding protein RBP2 deficiency effect on embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts lacking the retinoblastoma binding protein RBP2. RBP2 contains a histone demethylase signature motif, as well as other domains frequently found in transcriptional regulators. Results provide mechanistic insights into transcriptional regulation by RBP2.
