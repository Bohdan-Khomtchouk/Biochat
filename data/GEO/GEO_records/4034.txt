TITLE
Time course of diabetes-induced, anti-Interferon-γ injected NOD.Scid mice: pancreatic islets

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of microdissected islets of NOD.Scid mice injected with diabetogenic CD4+BDC2.5 (BDC) T cells, then injected with anti-interferon-γ monoclonal antibody which protected the mice from developing diabetes. Results provide insight into the role of INF-γ role in autoimmune diabetes.
