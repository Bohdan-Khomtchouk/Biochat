TITLE
Interleukin-2 null effect on the regulatory T cell-deficient scurfy model of autoimmune disease: CD4+ T-cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+ T cells purified from pooled peripheral lymph nodes of scurfy (Sf) mice deficient in interleukin-2. Sf.Il2-/- mice develop liver inflammation, but not inflammation of skin and lung, seen in Sf mice. Results provide insight into role of IL2 in multiorgan inflammation in Sf mice.
