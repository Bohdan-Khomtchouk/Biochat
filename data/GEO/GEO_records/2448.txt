TITLE
Erythropoietin effect on early erythroid progenitor cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ erythroid progenitors stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo) with or without LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Epo promotes differentiation and proliferation of early progenitors via activation of PI3K. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Epo.
