TITLE
Dual specificity phosphatase 1-deficient spleen response to lipopolysaccharide

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleens from dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1)-deficient mutants 6 hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Mutants injected intraperitoneally with LPS. Results provide insight into the role of DUSP1 in the innate immune response to LPS endotoxin shock.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
