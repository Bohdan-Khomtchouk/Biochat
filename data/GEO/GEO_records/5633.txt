TITLE
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ agonist and hypoxia effects on umbilical vein endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HUVECs stimulated with two important angiogenic stimuli: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ agonist and hypoxia. Results provide insight into possible synergistic molecular interactions between the PPAR β/δ and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 signaling pathways.
