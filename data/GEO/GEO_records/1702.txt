TITLE
Dark-grown phytochrome phyA phyB double mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of dark-grown Col phytochrome mutants given 1 hour of white light to induce germination, followed by 3 days in darkness. Phytochromes mediate a profound developmental shift upon light exposure. Results reveal signaling network paths between photoreceptors and target developmental genes.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
