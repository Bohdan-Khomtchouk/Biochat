TITLE
Polycomb repressive complex 1 protein Bmi1 transduced CCE embryonic stem cells and differentiated embryoid body samples

SUMMARY
Analysis of Bmi1 transduced CCE embryonic stem cells (ESC) and CCE ESC differentiated by embryoid body assay. Bmi1 is essential for maintaining the pool of adult stem cells. Results provide insight into role of Bmi1 in ESC-derived hematopoietic cell transition from pluripotency to differentiation.
