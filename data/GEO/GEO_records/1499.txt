TITLE
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta mutant overexpression effect on embryonic kidney cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 embryonic kidney cells overexpressing wild type hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1beta or HNF1alpha, or the HNF1beta A263insGG mutant. Results identify gene targets of HNF1 beta, and provide insight into the functional differences between HNF1beta and HNF1alpha.
