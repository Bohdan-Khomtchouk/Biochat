TITLE
One-Twenty-Two-1 knockout effect on hematopoietic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Lin- Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, which include the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population, sorted from bone marrow of Ott1 knockouts. HSCs lacking Ott1 are unable to maintain quiescence during proliferative stress. Results provide insight into the role of Ott1 in stress hematopoiesis.
