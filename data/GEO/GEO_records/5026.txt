TITLE
17β-estradiol effect on breast adenocarcinoma cells deficient in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer (BC) cells depleted for ERK5 then treated with 17β-estradiol. Increased kinase activity is associated with a poorer outcome for BC patients. Results provide insight into the interplay between estrogen receptor and protein kinase pathways to regulate BC aggressiveness
