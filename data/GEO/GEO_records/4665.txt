TITLE
HeLa cell line response to chemotherapeutic Casiopeinas

SUMMARY
Analysis of cervical cancer HeLa cells treated with casiopeinas II-gly (40µM) for 6 hours. Casiopeínas are copper-containing compounds that can promote selective programmed cell death in cancer cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying casiopeína-induced apoptosis.
