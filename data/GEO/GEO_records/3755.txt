SUMMARY
Analysis of aortas of nondiabetic and diabetic ApoE-null mice expressing or lacking the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE contributes to atherosclerosis in ApoE-null mice. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which RAGE accelerates atherosclerosis.
