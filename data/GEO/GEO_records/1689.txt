TITLE
Hypocotyl response to phototropic and gravitropic stimulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of localized expression patterns in hypocotyl tissue flanks from etiolated seedlings following mock, 2h phototropic, or 2h gravitropic stimulation. Results identify genes exhibiting differential expression between opposing flanks of tropically stimulated seedlings.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
