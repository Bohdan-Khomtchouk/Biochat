TITLE
Thyroid hormone triiodothyronine effect on tadpole tail: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of tails of NF stage 54 (NF54) premetamorphic tadpoles treated with thyroid hormone (TH) triiodothyronine (T3) up to 48 hours. NF61 tadpoles were in 0.1xMMR till they reached NF62. Premetamorphic tails are resorbed in response to TH. Results identify genes involved in TH-induced resorption.
