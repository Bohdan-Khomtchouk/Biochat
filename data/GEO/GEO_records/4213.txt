TITLE
NF-kB inactivation effect on T-ALL1 cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines treated with a peptide that inhibits the activity of IKK, an activator of NF-kB.  NF-kB pathway is downstream of oncogenic Notch1 in T-ALL. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of Notch-induced NF-kB activation in T-ALL.
