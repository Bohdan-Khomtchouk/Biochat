TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor-23 transgenic model

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys from C57Bl transgenics expressing human fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). FGF23 is a circulating protein that causes decreased renal inorganic phosphate (Pi) reabsorption. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Pi homeostasis by FGF23.
