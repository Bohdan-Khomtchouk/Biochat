TITLE
Nodose and dorsal root ganglia comparison (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole nodose ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) vs. the population of laser-captured visceral sensory neurons. Results identify striking differences and the need for microdissection when studying visceral sensory neurons because of dilution of signal by somatic sensory neurons.

ORGANISM
