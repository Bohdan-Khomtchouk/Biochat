TITLE
Filamentous-form growth on solid media

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of wild type diploid cells shifted from yeast-form growth in SHAD liquid (plentiful glucose and ammonium) to filamentous-form growth on SLAD agar (low ammonium). Filamentous-form cells collected hourly for 10 hours.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
