TITLE
PGC1alpha depletion effect on melanoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of A375P melanoma cells depleted for PGC1alpha. PGC1alpha is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. A375P is a cell line that overexpresses PGC1alpha. Results provide insight into the role of PGC1alpha in melanoma.
