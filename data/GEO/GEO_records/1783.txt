TITLE
Vascular smooth muscle response to voltage-dependent and store-operated calcium channel activation

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells after activation of voltage-dependent (VDCCs) or store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs). VDCCs activated by K+ depolarization and SOCCs by thapsigargin. Results provide insight into the effect of different calcium signals on gene expression.
