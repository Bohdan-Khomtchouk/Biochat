TITLE
Cannabinoid receptor double knockout mutant response to contact allergen

SUMMARY
Analysis of skins of mutants lacking 2 cannabinoid receptors after treatment with the contact allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). DNFB elicits a cutaneous T-cell mediated allergic response. Results provide insight into the role of the endocannabinoid system in allergic contact dermatitis.
