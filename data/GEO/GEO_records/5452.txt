TITLE
MLL2-depleted epidermal keratinocyte response to the induction of differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of MLL2-depleted neonatal epidermal keratinocytes following treatment with 1.8 mM calcium for 24 hours to induce differentiation. Histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL2 is a trithorax group protein. Results provide insight into the role of MLL2 in keratinocyte differentiation.
