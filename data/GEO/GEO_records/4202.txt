TITLE
Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell response to purine nucleoside analog LMP-420

SUMMARY
Analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient cells cultured with LMP-420 (2 uM) for 24 hr. LMP-420 is an anti-inflammatory agent that induces CLL cell apoptosis in vitro without impairing normal immune cells. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of LMP-420 in CLL.
