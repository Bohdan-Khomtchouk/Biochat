TITLE
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-Î´ and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A deficiency effect on RCAS PDGFB/Nestin tv-A glioma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of RCAS PDGFB/Nestin tv-A glioma cells from Ptprd knockout and Cdkn2a/p16Ink4a knockout mice. PTPRD is a tumor suppressor of glioma that is often co-deleted with tumor suppressor p16INK4A. Results provide insight into the cooperative effects of PTPRD and p16INK4A loss in gliomagenesis.
