TITLE
Photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor NR2E3 ectopic expression effect on NRL null retinas

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 week-old neural retinal leucine zipper (NRL) null retinas expressing photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (NR2E3) from the cone-rod homeobox (CRX) promoter. NRL, NR2E3, and CRX control photoreceptor differentiation. Results provide insight into the molecular function of NR2E3.
