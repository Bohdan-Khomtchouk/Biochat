TITLE
Hedgehog-induced medulloblastoma model (MG-430B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of medulloblastoma tumors formed in transgenics by expressing an activated form of Smoothened (Smo). Expression of the activated Smo transmembrane protein results in activation of Hh signaling. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Hh-related tumorigenesis.
