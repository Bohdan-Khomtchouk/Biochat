TITLE
Bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 inactivation in smooth muscle effect on the lung: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs 1 or 8 weeks following induction in smooth muscle of a dominant negative mutant form of type 2 bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPR2). Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disorder associated with BMPR2 mutations.
