TITLE
Motoneuron characterization

SUMMARY
Analysis of lateral and medial motoneurons (MNs) from lumbar segments and sympathetic preganglionic motoneurons located in the thoracic intermediolateral nucleus. MNs isolated by laser capture microdissection. Results provide insight into the molecular differences between adult MN types.
