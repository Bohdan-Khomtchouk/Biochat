TITLE
Tropomodulin3 deficiency effect on the fetal liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of at E14.5 fetal livers of Tropomodulin3 (Tmod3) deficient mutants. Tmod3 deletion leads to embryonic lethality at E14.5-E18.5, with anemia due to defects in definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver. Results provide insight into the role of Tmod3 in erythroid differentiation.
