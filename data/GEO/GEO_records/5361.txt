TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose stroma from nulliparous, lactating and involuting mammary glands. Pregnancy-associated breast cancers (PABCs) diagnosed during lactation are generally more aggressive with poorer prognosis. Results provide insight into the role of stromal changes in the pathogenesis of PABCs.
