TITLE
Arachidonic acid effect on prostate cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PC-3 prostate cancer cells incubated with arachidonic acid (AA).  AA is an omega-6 fatty acid shown to induce cancer cell proliferation. Results suggest AA plays an important role in stimulation of growth-related genes and proliferation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling.
