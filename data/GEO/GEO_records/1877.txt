TITLE
slbo mutant migratory cells of the ovary

SUMMARY
Analysis of slbo mutant border and centripetal migratory cells in the ovary. SLBO, a C/EBP family transcriptional activator, is required for the switch from stationary to migratory behavior. Results identify genes involved in cell migration and downstream targets of SLBO.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
