TITLE
Breast cancer cell lines response to chemotherapeutic drugs: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 breast cell lines treated for up to 36 hrs with the chemotherapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil (5FU), doxorubicin (DOX), or etoposide (ETOP), a drug mechanistically similar to DOX. Expression profiles for DOX- and 5FU-treated cells were used to successfully predict the response to ETOP.
