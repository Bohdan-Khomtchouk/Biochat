TITLE
Diabetogenic 3A9 T-cell transfer model of type I diabetes: pancreatic islets

SUMMARY
Analysis of islet cells after injection of diabetogenic 3A9 CD4 T cells into nondiabetic B10.BR IP-HEL recipients, 8 to 24 hrs post-transfer. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the T-cell entry induced state of receptivity of islets to subsequent immunological insults.
