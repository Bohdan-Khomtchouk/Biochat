TITLE
Cereal crop reproductive development: anther (Agilent)

SUMMARY
Analysis of anther development across multiple stages from hypodermal archesporial cells formation (Stage ID: An1) to tri-cellular mature pollen (Stage ID: P3). The same RNA samples were used for Agilent and Affymetrix experiments. Results provide insight into the reliability of the Affymetrix data.

ORGANISM
