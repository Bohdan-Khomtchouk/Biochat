TITLE
Tumor necrosis factor effect on macrovascular umbilical vein endothelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrovascular umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha for 5 hours. TNF is a potent inflammatory stimulus. Results provide insight into the relevance of the diversity of endothelial cell subtypes for the response to inflammatory stimuli.
