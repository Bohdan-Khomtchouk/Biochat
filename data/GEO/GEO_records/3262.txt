TITLE
Pediatric malignant germ cell tumors: yolk sac tumors and seminomas

SUMMARY
Analysis of yolk sac tumors (YSTs) and seminomas, the two principal histological variants of pediatric malignant germ cell tumors (MGCTs). Seminomas and YSTs are presumed to arise from the same progenitor cell. Results provide insight into the molecular basis for the divergence of pediatric MGCTs.
