TITLE
cAMP agonist forskolin effect on INS-1 insulinoma cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of insulinoma cells after short-term (2hr) and long-term (16hr) stimulation with cAMP agonist forskolin. Incretin hormone GLP-1 enhances islet cell survival via cAMP pathway induction in beta cells. Results provide insight into mechanisms by which GLP-1 promotes pancreatic islet viability.
