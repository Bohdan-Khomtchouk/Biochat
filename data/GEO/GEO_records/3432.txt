TITLE
Osteosarcoma cell line response to activation of specific glucocorticoid receptor alpha isoforms: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of glucocorticoid receptor alpha (hGRalpha) isoform -A, -B, -C, or -D expressing osteosarcoma cells for up to 24 h after hGRalpha activation with dexomethasone. Cell apoptosis occurred in a GR isoform-selective manner. Results provide insight into the function of each isoform.
