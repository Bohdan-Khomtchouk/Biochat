TITLE
HMEC-1 endothelial cell line response to infection by Rickettsia prowazekii

SUMMARY
Analysis of endothelial cells infected by R. prowazekii strains (Erus, Evir, Rp22) of varying virulence. Virulent R. prowazekii causes epidemic typhus and avirulent strains can revert to virulence. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of virulence and adaptive mutation in R. prowazekii.
