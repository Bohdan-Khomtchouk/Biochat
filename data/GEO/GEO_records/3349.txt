TITLE
STAT5 depleted pro-B cell line response to IL-3: time course (MG-U74A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of STAT5A and STAT5B depleted proB Ba/F3-beta cells stimulated with IL-3 for 0.5 or 2 hours. STAT5A and STAT5B are members of the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription. Results identify IL-3 inducible STAT5 target genes.
