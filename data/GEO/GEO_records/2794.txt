TITLE
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line response to Notch receptor inhibition

SUMMARY
Analysis of T-cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL) MOLT4 cells following gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) DAPT treatment. Gamma-secretase activity is required for Notch 1 receptor signaling. Results provide insight into the role of Notch signaling in T-ALL development.
