TITLE
H3K4me3 histone demethylase Fbxl10 overexpression effect on fibroblast cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MEF cell line stably overexpressing Fbxl10. Stable overexpression of Fbxl10 leads to an increase in cell size but no changes to proliferation, mitosis, apoptosis, or global histone marks. Results provide insight into the regulatory role of Fbx110 in fibroblasts.
