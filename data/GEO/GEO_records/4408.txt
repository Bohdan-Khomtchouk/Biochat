TITLE
Nitric oxide generator DETA-NONOate effect on in vitro neuronal injury model: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary cortical neurons treated with nitric oxide (NO) generator DETA-NONOate for up to 24 hrs. High doses of NO, often observed in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, cause neuronal death. Results provide insight into molecular events contributing to NO-induced neuronal injury.
