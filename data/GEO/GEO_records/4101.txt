TITLE
Response of pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells to CD24 down-regulation by monoclonal antibody or small interfering RNA

SUMMARY
Analysis of HT29 and Colo357 cancer cell lines following treatment with anti-CD24 mAbs, and HT29 cells after expression of 1 or 2 shRNA vectors directed at the CD24 gene. CD24 is overexpressed in a large variety of human malignancies. Results provide insight into the role of CD4 in carcinogenesis.
