TITLE
Mutant p53 depletion effect on MDA-468.shp53 breast tumor cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-468.shp53 cells cultured under 3D conditions in the presence of DOX.  These cells express a DOX-inducible shRNA targeting endogenous mutant p53. The p53-reduced cells have an invasive, highly disorganized appearance. Results provide insight into role of mutant p53 in breast cancer.
