TITLE
Cisplatin effect on breast cancer cell line MCF-7: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 cell line treated with chemotheraputic agent cisplatin and collected when glycolysis was induced (change of ph; 8-9h) and at the beginning of cell death (change of impedance; 10-11h). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the specific metabolic response.
