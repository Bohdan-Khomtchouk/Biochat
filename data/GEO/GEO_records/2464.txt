TITLE
Polyglutamine expansion disease model: retina

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas from R7E animals expressing the mutant ataxin-7, which harbors 90 glutamines. Polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7 causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). Results provide insight into the molecular and cellular pathways involved in polyglutamine-induced retinal degeneration.
