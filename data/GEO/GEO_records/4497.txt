TITLE
Acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with high Ecotropic Viral Integration site 1 expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines with high or low Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) expression. High EVI1 levels predict adverse outcome in chemotherapy-resistant AML patients. Results provide insight into novel molecular targets in AML with high EVI1 expression.
