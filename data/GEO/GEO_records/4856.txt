TITLE
Transcription factor Yin Yang 1 deficiency effect on the skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of the soleus muscles of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) deficient animals. Many nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins contain binding sites for YY1 in their proximal promoters. Results provide insight into the role of YY1 in mitochondrial function.
