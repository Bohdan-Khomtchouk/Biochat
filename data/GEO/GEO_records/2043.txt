TITLE
Bisphenol A effect on testicular Sertoli cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of testicular Sertoli cells (TSCs) treated with bisphenol A (BPA) for up to 12 hours. BPA, an industrial chemical that acts as an environmental estrogen, induces TSC death. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying TSC injury, which is accompanied by ER stress, induced by BPA.
