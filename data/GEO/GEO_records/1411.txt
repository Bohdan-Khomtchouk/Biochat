TITLE
HCaRG overexpression in kidney cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCaRG9, a stably-transfected HEK293 embryonal kidney cell line over-expressing the hypertension-related, calcium-regulated gene (HCaRG). Results identify a role for HCaRG in kidney repair involving increased renal cell migration and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-Î±) expression.
