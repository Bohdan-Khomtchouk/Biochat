TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum stress effect on lymphoblastoid cells of monozygotic twins

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized B cells from MZ twin pairs (14 of European ancestry, 12 African American) treated in vitro with thapsigargin to induce ER stress.  ER stress induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the UPR response within twin pairs.
