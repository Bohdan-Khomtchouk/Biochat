TITLE
Genetic variation in gene expression among parents and progenies (dye-swap)

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of parental strains and haploid progenies from a cross of strain BY4716 and the wild wine strain RM11-1a. Results used to find linkage between gene expression levels, which are treated as quantitative traits, and genetic markers.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
