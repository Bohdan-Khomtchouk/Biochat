TITLE
Long noncoding MALAT1 RNA deficiency effect on normal diploid fibroblasts W138

SUMMARY
Analysis of WI38 fibroblasts transfected with MALAT1 antisense oligonucleotides (AS-1, AS-2). MALAT1 RNA is upregulated in cancer tissues and its elevated expression associated with hyper-proliferation. Results provide mechanistic insights on the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.
