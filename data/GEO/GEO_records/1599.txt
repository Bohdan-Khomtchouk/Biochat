TITLE
Follicular dendritic cell enriched splenocytes (MG U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of follicular dendritic cell (FDCs) enriched splenocytes. FDCs are important in the formation of lymphoid germinal centers (GCs), where rapid B-cell proliferation and differentiation occur. Results identify transcripts that are overrepresented in cells associated with FDC networks in GCs.
