SUMMARY
Analysis of jejuna of Kr√ºppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) null mutants. Klf9, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is involved in the control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell fate. Results provide insight into role of Klf9 in intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination
