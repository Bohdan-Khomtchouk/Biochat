TITLE
Sustained EGR1 expression in endothelial cells: time course (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at various time points up to 48 hours following transfection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing early growth response-1 (EGR1). EGR1 is implicated in cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. Results identify potential EGR1 target genes.
