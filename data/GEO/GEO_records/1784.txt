TITLE
Protein kinase B alpha knockout effect on adipogenesis: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of protein kinase B alpha (PKBalpha) knockout embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) following treatment with a standard induction cocktail to induce differentiation into adipocytes. Cells examined up to 48 hours following treatment. Results provide insight into the role of PKBalpha in adipogenesis.
