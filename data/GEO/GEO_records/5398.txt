TITLE
RANKL effect on osteoclastogenic cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of H10 osteoclastogenic cells following treatment with soluble recombinant receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand to induce osteoclastogenesis. H10 cells derived from RAW264.7 macrophages. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating osteoclastogenesis.
