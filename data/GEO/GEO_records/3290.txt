TITLE
Interleukin-6 effect on skeletal muscle tissue: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) infused skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsies at time points up to 6hr. IL-6, a cytokine secreted from skeletal muscle during exercise, works in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. Results provide insight into IL-6-induced expression of other secreted factors in SKM.
