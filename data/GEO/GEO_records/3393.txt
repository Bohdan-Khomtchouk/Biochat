TITLE
Bronchial epithelial cells response to interleukin-22 and interleukin-17

SUMMARY
Analysis of bronchial epithelial cells treated with interleukin (IL)-22, IL-17, or both.  IL-17 receptor mutant lungs are susceptible to Klebsiella pneumonia infections. IL-22 induces antimicrobial peptide expression. Results provide insight into the extent of IL-22 and IL-17's role in host defense.
