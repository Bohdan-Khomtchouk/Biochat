TITLE
Renal tubular von Hippel-Lindau protein preconditional knockout effect on rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI kidney

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidney from transgenics depleted for renal tubular von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) then injected with glycerol to induce acute kidney injury (AKI). VHL is a ubiquitin ligase involved in the HIF-Î± degradation process.  Results provide insight into the role of HIF activation in AKI.
