TITLE
Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of ES cells and iPS cells before (day 0) and after (day 5) endodermal differentiation. E8.25 embryonic definitive endoderm (DE) was also examined. Results provide insight into the relative equivalency of DE derived from ES/iPS cells in vitro and authentic DE from embryos in vivo.
