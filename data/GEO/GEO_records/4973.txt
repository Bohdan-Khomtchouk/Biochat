TITLE
Ubiquitin specific protease 22 depletion effect on embryonic stem cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of E14 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depleted for ubiquitin specific protease 22 (Usp22). ESCs depleted of the epigenetic modifying enzyme Usp22 fail to differentiate properly. Results provide insight into the role of Usp22 in ESC differentiation.
