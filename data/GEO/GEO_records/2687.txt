TITLE
Kruppel-like factor 15 deficient liver and skeletal muscle response to fasting

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers and quadriceps muscles of Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) null mutants after an overnight fast. KLF15 nulls develop hypoglycemia after fasting. Gluconeogenesis (GLC) is essential for preventing hypoglycemia during fasting. Results provide insight into the role of KLF15 in GLC.
