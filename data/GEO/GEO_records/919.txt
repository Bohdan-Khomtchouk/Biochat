TITLE
Cytosine methylase inactivation and histone deacetylase inhibition effect on expression

SUMMARY
Analysis of 16 day old Columbia plantlets grown in media with 7 ug/ml 5-aza-2'deoxycytosine (aza-dC) to block cytosine methylation (Cm) or 0.5 uM trichostatin A (TSA) to block histone deacetylation (HD) or both. Results provide insight into the interaction between Cm and HD in gene regulation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
