TITLE
Huntington's disease Hdh knock-out and knock-in embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem cells without Hdh or with knock-in alleles with different Hdh CAG-polyglutamine repeat sizes. CAG-repeat length is inversely correlated with the age of onset of Huntington's disease (HD) symptoms in humans. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying HD.
