TITLE
Werner syndrome protein and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 null mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Werner syndrome (WS) protein (Wrn), or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), or both. Mutations in Wrn or PARP-1 result in genomic instability. Results provide insight into tumor progression, senescence, oxidative stress and aging.
