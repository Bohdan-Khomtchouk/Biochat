TITLE
PTEN deletion mutation effect on colon cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT116 colon cancer cells in which tumor suppressor gene PTEN had been deleted by gene targeting. Activation of PI3K signaling by PTEN mutations can lead to activation of p53-mediated cell growth suppression. Results provide insight into the role of PTEN in cancer pathogenesis.
