TITLE
Glucose effect on young and aged pancreatic islets: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of islets isolated from young and aged animals and cultured for 2 days at 3 to 16mM glucose (G3 to G16). Freshly-isolated islets were also examined. Ageing is associated with functional changes in beta cells. Results provide insight into the molecular response of aged islets to glucose.
