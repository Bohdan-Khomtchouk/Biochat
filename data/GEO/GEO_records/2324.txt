TITLE
Low concentrations of 17beta-estradiol effect on breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MCF7/BUS cells treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2) at concentrations up to 100 pM. Results compared to that from an experiment examining the response to hormone starvation (GDS2323). Results provide insight into the E2 sensitivity of E2 inducible or suppressible genes.
