TITLE
Alzheimer's disease: induced pluripotent stem cells with Presenilin 2 mutation (N141)

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2 iPSC clones with presenilin 2 (PS2) mutation N141, established by retroviral transduction of fibroblasts from a Familial Alzheimerâ€™s disease (FAD) patient. PS2 mutations are causative factors for autosomal-dominant early-onset FAD. Results provide insight into molecular basis of FAD.
