TITLE
Renal clear cell carcinoma-thyroid hormone receptor mutants: HepG3 cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of HepG2 transformants expressing: wildtype thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-TR mutants, or renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC)-TR mutants, in the presence of hormone agonist T3 thyronine. Results provide insight into a unique regulatory repertoire for RCCCs.
