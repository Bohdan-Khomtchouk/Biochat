TITLE
c-Myb and oncogenic variant v-Myb transcriptional activities

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes infected with adenovirus expressing c-Myb or its oncogenic variant v-Myb, a mutated (11 AA substitutions) and truncated (N- and C-termini) version of c-Myb. Results identify dramatic, qualitative changes in the transcriptional acitivity of c-Myb caused by oncogenic mutations.
