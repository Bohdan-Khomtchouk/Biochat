TITLE
Sodium tungstate effect on insulin receptor substrate 2 knockout mice: pancreatic islets

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islets from insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) knockouts treated with anti-diabetic compound sodium tungstate for 21 days. Tungstate normalizes glucose tolerance in the Irs2 -/- animals. Results provide insight into the molecular effects of tungstate on pancreatic Î²-cells.
