TITLE
Dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area

SUMMARY
Analysis of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) from normal animals. SNc dopaminergic neurons are more susceptible to degeneration in Parkinson's disease than VTA dopaminergic neurons.

ORGANISM
