TITLE
Guided differentiation into dopaminergic neurons and random differentiation into embryoid bodies

SUMMARY
Comparison of cells induced to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons by guided differentiation (GD) to those induced to differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) by random differentiation (RD). Cells at 3 stages of differentiation in the GD model and days 4 to 21 EBs in the RD model compared.
