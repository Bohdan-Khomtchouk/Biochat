TITLE
Intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont response to polysaccharide and simple sugar diets

SUMMARY
Analysis of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT) from the ceca of mice on polysaccharide or simple sugar diets. BT is involved in the breakdown of plant polysaccharides. BT-colonized mice is a human gut ecosystem model. Results identify genes that may endow flexibility in adapting to dietary changes.
