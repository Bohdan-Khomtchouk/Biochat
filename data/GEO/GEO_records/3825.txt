TITLE
SP-C/c-raf transgenic model of lung cancer: dysplasia

SUMMARY
Analysis of dysplastic lung cells and transgenic but morphologically unaltered lung cells, both harvested from SP-C/c-raf transgenics. Normal lung from non-transgenic littermates also examined. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying an early stage of lung cancer development.
