TITLE
Signal transduction adaptor MyD88 deficient lung response to Chlamydia pneumoniae infection

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs from MyD88 null mutants following Chlamydia pneumoniae infection. Toll-like receptors and key adaptor protein MyD88 play a critical role in inducing immunity against this microorganism. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this MyD88-mediated induction.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
