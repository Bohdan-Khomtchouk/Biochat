TITLE
Megakaryocytes at successive stages of maturation

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary megakaryocytes (MK) purified after 3 to 6 days in culture. MKs undergo sequential morphologic and functional transitions that culminate in platelet assembly in proplatelets.  Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying MK differentiation and platelet formation.
