TITLE
Radiation chimera model: Trp53-null mammary tumors arising from irradiated, TGFb1 heterozygote hosts

SUMMARY
Analysis of Trp53-null tumors arising from Tgfb1+/- hosts cleared of mammary gland epithelia, irradiated, then transplanted with nonmalignant Trp53-null mammary tissue. TGF-Î² drives EMT and is highly induced by IR. Results provide insight into host biology contributions to radiation carcinogenesis.
