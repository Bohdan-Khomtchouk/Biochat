TITLE
Transcription factors Mixer and Sox17beta expression effect on naïve ectodermal tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of naïve ectodermal tissue excised from embryos injected with Mixer or Sox17beta mRNA. Mixer and Sox17beta are important in endoderm specification during embryogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of endoderm development.
