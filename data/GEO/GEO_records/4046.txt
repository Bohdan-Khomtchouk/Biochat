TITLE
Fusion oncogenes ZMYM2/FGFR1, BCR/FGFR1 or BCR/ABL1 in cord blood CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of cord blood CD34+ cells transduced with MIG vector-ZMYM2/FGFR1, -BCR/FGFR1or -P210 BCR/ABL1. FGFR1 fusion oncogenes are associated with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS) and aggressive acute myeloid leukemia. Results provide insight into role of FGFR1 fusion oncogenes in EMS onset.
