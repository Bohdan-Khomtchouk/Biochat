TITLE
Telomerase reverse transcriptase immortalizing effect on fibroblasts and endothelial cells: time-course

SUMMARY
Analysis of normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, at various population doubling levels (PDLs), following human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transfection. hTERT mediates cellular immortalization. Results identify cell-type specific transcriptional responses during immortalization.
