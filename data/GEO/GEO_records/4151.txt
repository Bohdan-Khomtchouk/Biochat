TITLE
Non-phosphorylated FTY720 effect on immortalized microglia HMO6 cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized brain HMO6 microglia treated with FTY720-non-P, a non-phosphorylated form of FTY720 (a synthetic analog of sphingosine). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering FTY720-non-P-induced apoptosis of HMO6.
