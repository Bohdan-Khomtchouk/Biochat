TITLE
AML1-ETO fusion protein effect on CD34+ hematopoietic cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ hematopoietic cells expressing the AML1-ETO fusion protein which is formed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from translocation t(8;21). CD34+ cells isolated from peripheral blood progenitor and cord blood cells. Results provide insight into the role of AML1-ETO in leukemogenesis.
