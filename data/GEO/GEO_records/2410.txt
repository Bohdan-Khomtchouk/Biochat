TITLE
Edema toxin effect on macrophage cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of RAW 264.7 macrophage cells treated with edema toxin (EdTx) for 3 or 6 hours. EdTx is an adenylyl cyclase enzyme produced by Bacillus anthracis. It converts ATP to cAMP, resulting in interstitial edema in anthrax patients. Results provide insight into the effect of EdTx in the host cell.
