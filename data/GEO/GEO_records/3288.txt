TITLE
Fibroblast pseudopodia response to fibronectin

SUMMARY
Analysis of pseudopodia from NIH/3T3 cells extending protrusions in response to fibronectin, a haptotactic stimulus. Asymmetric distribution of RNAs establishes polarity in multiple cell types. Results provide insight into RNAs that localize in cell protrusions in response to migratory stimuli.

ORGANISM
