TITLE
Endothelin-1 effect on dermal fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Anlaysis of primary dermal fibroblasts treated with exogenous endothelin-1 (ET1) peptide for 24 hours. ET1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. Results suggest that stable silencing of Et1 is important for the phenotypic stability of dermal fibroblasts.
