SUMMARY
Expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines HCC 1954 and MDA-MB-436 in reference to mammary epithelial cells.  Results used to validate a method of comparing data generated from Affymetrix arrays to that from cDNA arrays.  The method uses DNA sequence to match probes between platforms.
