Rift Valley Fever virus ZH548 infection effect on BALB/cByJ and MBT/Pas embryonic fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of fibroblasts from BALB/cByJ or MBT/Pas animals infected with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV). RVFV is an arthropod-borne virus that primarily infects ruminants but can infect humans. Results provided insight into the role of genetic variation among hosts and their susceptibility to RVFV.
