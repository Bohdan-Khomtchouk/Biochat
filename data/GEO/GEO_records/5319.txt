TITLE
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 deficiency effect on developing trophoblast stem cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1)-deficient trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) up to 4 days after the induction of differentiation. Lsd1 is an epigenetic regulator. Results provide insight into the role of Lsd1 in TCS differentiation.
