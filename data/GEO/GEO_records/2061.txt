TITLE
Interleukin 2 deficient regulatory T cells expressing transcription factor Foxp3

SUMMARY
Analysis of interleukin 2 (IL-2)-deficient, Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells. Foxp3+ Treg cells mediate dominant immune tolerance to self. Treg cells express IL-2 receptor alpha-chain CD25, but the role of IL-2 has been controversial to date. Results identify a role for IL-2 in Treg cells.
