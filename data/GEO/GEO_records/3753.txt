TITLE
Skin-derived precursors

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary passage neonatal skin-derived precursors (SKP) and Sox2-positive hair follicle dermal cells from which SKPs derive. SKPs and Sox2+ dermal precursors share similar function and transcriptional profile. Results provide insight into potential role of SKPs as adult dermal stem cells.
