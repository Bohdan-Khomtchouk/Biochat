TITLE
Octreotide effect on the oxyntic mucosa

SUMMARY
Analysis of the oxyntic mucosa (OM) of animals treated with the long-acting release (LAR) formulation of octreotide (OCT), a somastostatin analog. OCT-LAR causes the regression of gastric ECL-cell carcinoids. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the antiproliferative effect of OCT.
