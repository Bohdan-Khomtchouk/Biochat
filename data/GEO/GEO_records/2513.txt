TITLE
Nicotinamide effect on thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocyte differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of thrombopoietin-cultured CD34+ cells at various time points up to 5 days following treatment with nicotinamide. Thrombopoietin induces CD34+ cells to differentiate into megakaryocytes. Results provide insight into the effect of nicotinamide on megakaryocyte differentiation.
