TITLE
Estradiol effect on uterus of EAAE estrogen receptor α DNA-binding-deficient model

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri from ovariectomized, EAAE ERα DNA-binding domain mutants collected 2hrs after estradiol injection. The EAAE mouse has an ERα null-like female reproductive tract phenotype. Results provide insight into the ability of EAAE ERα to mediate transcriptional responses in the uterus.
