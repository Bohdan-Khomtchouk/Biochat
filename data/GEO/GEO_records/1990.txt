TITLE
Mdr2 knockout model of hepatocellular carcinoma at precancerous stages

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of 3 and 12-month-old Mdr2 knockout (Mdr2-KO) mutants. Mdr2-KO mutants lack the liver P-glycoprotein responsible for phosphatidylcholine transport across the canalicular membrane, and develop hepatocellular carcinoma between the ages of 12 and 15 months.
