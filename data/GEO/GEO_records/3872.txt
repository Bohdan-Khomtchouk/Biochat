TITLE
Xenograft ovarian tumor response to anti-cancer therapeutic MT19: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of ovarian xenograft tumors from nude mice inoculated with SKOV-3 cells then treated with anti-cancer agent MT19c. Xenograft tumors collected up to 30 days after initiation of MT19c treatment. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian xenograft tumor progression.
