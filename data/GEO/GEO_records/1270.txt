TITLE
SPT10 global transcription regulator null mutant

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of mutants lacking Spt10p. Spt10p binds the upstream activating sequences in all major core histone promoters. Results provide insight into the mechanism by which Spt10p acts as a global regulator of transcription.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
