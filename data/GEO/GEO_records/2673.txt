TITLE
Pupariation

SUMMARY
Analysis of animals before and after pupariation. A pulse of steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) at late 3rd instar triggers puparium formation; a second 20E pulse after pupariation marks the prepupal-to-pupal transition. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of 20E signaling.
