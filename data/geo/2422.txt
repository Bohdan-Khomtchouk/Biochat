TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor 2 restimulation effect on embryonic fibroblast

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts starved of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) for 2 days and subsequently restimulated with FGF2. FGF2 promotes the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) . Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC self-renewal in response to FGF2.
