TITLE
Neurofibromin inactivation effect on triceps muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of triceps muscles of 3 month old animals inactivated for the neurofibromin Nf1 gene in the early limb bud mesenchyme.  This inactivation results in muscular dystrophy. Results provide insight into the role of Nf1 in skeletal muscle development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
