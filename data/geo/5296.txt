TITLE
Three dimensional culturing effect on dermal papilla cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of intact papillae isolated from male occipital scalp skin, 2D cultures of dermal papilla (DP) cells (passage 1, 3, 5) and 3D spheroid cultures of DP cells. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying spatial environment influences regulating dermal papilla cell induction.
