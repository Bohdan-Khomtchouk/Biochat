TITLE
H3K9me2 methyltransferase G9a depletion effect on breast cancer cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells depleted for G9a, a methyltransferase that mediates histone H3 lysine-9 di-methylation (H3K9me2). G9a depletion inhibits migratory ability and invasiveness of MDA-MB231 cells. Results provide insight into role of G9a and H3K9me2 in breast cancer progression.
