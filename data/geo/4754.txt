TITLE
TYK2 and STAT1 silencing effect on JURKAT T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of JURKAT cells transduced with TYK2 and STAT1 shRNAs. JAK tyrosine kinase TYK2 and downstream effector STAT1 promote survival of T-ALL cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TYK2-STAT1 pathway dependence in T-cell ALL.
