TITLE
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin stimulation effect on hepatic stellate cells: time course (experiment 1)

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) cultured with LPS for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hr. During exposure to toxins such as LPS, the liver suffers inflammatory injury. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic inflammatory and immune responses.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
