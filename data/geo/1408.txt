TITLE
Auxin response factors ARF6 and ARF8

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage 1-14 flowers from wild type Columbia, arf6/arf6 ARF8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants after 30 minute treatment with 10 uM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Results provide insight into early flower development and identify genes that respond rapidly to auxin in an ARF6/ARF8-dependent manner.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
