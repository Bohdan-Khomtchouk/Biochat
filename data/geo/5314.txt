TITLE
Placental CD14+ macrophage-derived multinucleated giant cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of placental multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) obtained from at-term placental CD14+ macrophages cultured in DMEM-F12 containing 10% FCS and antibiotics for 9 days. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the maturation of macrophages into MGCs.
