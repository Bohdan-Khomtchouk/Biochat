TITLE
Anopheles gambiae embryos and embryonic serosa

SUMMARY
Analysis of isolated serosa or extracted embryos at 10.5 hours. Serosal cells secrete a dedicated serosal cuticle that protects embryos from desiccation. These results, together with array results for staged embryos, provide insight into molecular basis for the drought tolerance of A. gambiae.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
