TITLE
Male and female fruit flies of various wild-type laboratory strains

SUMMARY
Analysis of male and female flies of 5 wild-type laboratory strains. Results provide insight into the extent to which transcriptional variation is inherent in commonly used laboratory strains and the relationship of variation in gene expression to sexual dimorphism.
