TITLE
Phosphomannose isomerase PMI40 deletion strain response to excess mannose

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a phosphomannose isomerase PMI40 deletion strain growing on media with various mannose concentrations up to 5 g/liter.  Results provide insight into the cause of slow growth exhibited by the PMI40 deletion strain in media with excess mannose.

ORGANISM
