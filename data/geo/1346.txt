TITLE
Bruton's tyrosine kinase mutant models of X-linked agammaglobulinemia

SUMMARY
Analysis of splenic B cells from mutants with a knockout of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) or a R28C missense mutation in Btk. Btk mutations cause a block in B cell differentiation and lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of XLA.
