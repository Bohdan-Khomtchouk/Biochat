TITLE
Hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus response to gamma irradiation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Pyrococcus furiosus cells exposed to 2.5 kGy of gamma radiation and then incubated at 90ยบ C for up to 4 hours. At this dose, P. furiosus exhibits 75% survival. Results provide insight into the pathways involved in the repair of lesions produced by ionizing irradiation in P. furiosus.

ORGANISM
