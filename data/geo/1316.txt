TITLE
GATA-1 variant role in Down syndrome megakaryocytic leukemias

SUMMARY
Analysis of megakaryocytes and their progenitors from mutant E12.5 embryo liver expressing truncated transcription factor GATA-1. Results provide insight into the role of variant GATA-1 (GATA1s) in megakaryocyte hyperproliferation and Down syndrome (DS)-associated leukemias (TMD, DS-AMKL/DS-AML M7).
