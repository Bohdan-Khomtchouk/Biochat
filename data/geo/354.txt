TITLE
Lithium response in yeast

SUMMARY
Wild type CEN.PK113-7D grown with 20 g/L galactose. LiCl (10 mM, therapeutically relevant) added and samples analyzed at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 140 minutes after LiCl addition. Lithium inhibits phosphoglucomutase, affecting galactose uptake and growth.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
