TITLE
Transcription factor p63 null mutation effect on skin (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin from transcription factor p63 homozygous null mutants at embryonic age E18.5. Without p63, the epidermis fails to commit to stratification, resulting in aborted skin development. Results identify p63 target genes and provide insight into early events in epidermal morphogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
