TITLE
Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 isoform reduced expression effect on hearts

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of hearts from 8 to 16 week old adult males lacking one copy of the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 isoform.  Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 isoform expression is reduced by half in heterozygous null mutants.  Results provide insight into the role of the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 isoform in the heart.
