TITLE
Folic acid deficiency effect on colon cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of HT-29 colon cancer cells cultured in pteroylglutamic acid or methyl-tetrahydrofolate at concentrations of 10 or 100 ng/ml each. Studies suggest that folate deficiency can have an inhibitory effect on the progression of established colonic tumor cells.
