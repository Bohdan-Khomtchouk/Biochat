TITLE
Ethanol effect on myoblast differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of C2C12 cells cultured for up to 3 days in differentiation medium containing ethanol. Chronic alcoholics suffer from weakness and locomotor difficulty resulting from muscle damage. Results provide insight into the signaling pathways affected by ethanol in differentiating myoblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
