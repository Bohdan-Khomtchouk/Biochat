TITLE
Liver response to Pacific ciguatoxin-1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult male C57/BL6 livers exposed to a symptomatic dose of the marine neurotoxin Pacific ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1) for up to 24 hours. Ciguatoxins (CTX) are polyether neurotoxins that target voltage-gated sodium channels. Results provide insight into the hepatic molecular response to CTX.
