TITLE
Oncogenic NRAS depletion effect on melanoma cell lines: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of melanoma 224 and BL cells for up to 3 days after suppression of the mutant NRAS Q61R gene with siRNA siMut10 or siMut12. Activating mutations in NRAS gene is a common genetic event in malignant melanoma. Results provide insight into the role of NRAS in the pathogenesis of melanoma.
