TITLE
Self-renewing memory B cell

SUMMARY
Analysis of plasma, germinal center, and memory B cells (mBCs) from animals immunized with the T-dependent antigen, NP-CGG. MBC, memory T (mTCs), and long-term hematopoietic stem cells (Lt-HSCs) undergo self-renewal. Results indicate mBCs share a transcriptional program with mTCs and Lt-HSCs.
