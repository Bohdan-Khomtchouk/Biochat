TITLE
Myelomatous bone marrow samples after aspiration: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of myeloma-patient whole bone marrow (BM) aspirates after immediate RNA fixation or after delayed fixation (up to 660 min). Aspiration interrupts the natural BM interactions. Results provide insight into the molecular pathways regulated by intercellular interactions within myelomatous BM.
