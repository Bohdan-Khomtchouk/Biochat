TITLE
Bedaquiline treatment: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis treated with Bedaquiline (BDQ; Sirturo) and harvested up to 360 min after drug addition. BDQ, an ATP synthase inhibitor, causes bacteriostasis within hours of treatment. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying BDQ-induced bacterial killing.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
