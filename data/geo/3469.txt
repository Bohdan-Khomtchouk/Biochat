TITLE

SUMMARY
Analysis of monocytes following stimulation with leukotriene D4 (LTD4), a cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT). CysLTs are mediators of innate immune responsiveness and chronic inflammatory diseases. Results provide insight into the signaling pathways involved in monocyte activation by cysLTs.
