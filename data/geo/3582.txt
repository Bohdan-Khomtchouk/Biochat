TITLE
PTEN heterozygosity effect on Smoothened-active mouse model

SUMMARY
Analysis of medulloblastoma (MB) tumors from mice heterozygous for PTEN. SmoA1 +; Pten +/- mice exhibited decreased survival, an increased incidence, and a shorter time to onset of symptoms, compared to SmoA1 +; Pten +/+ mice. Results provide insight into the role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of MB.
