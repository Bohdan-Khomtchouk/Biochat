TITLE
Transcription factor Ovo1 depletion effect on 12 hour post-fertilization embryos

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild-type embryos injected with Ovo1 morpholino antisense oligos. At 12 hpf, the Ovo1 morphants begin showing neural crest (NC) defects wherein a subset of NC cells aggregates in the dorsal midline above the neural tube. Results provide insight into the role of Ovo1 in NC migration.
