TITLE
Growth hormone effect on adipocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes treated with 500 nM growth hormone (GH). Adipocytes examined at various time points up to 48 hours following treatment with GH. Chronic GH treatment induces metabolic changes consistent with insulin resistance in 3T3-F442A adipocytes.
