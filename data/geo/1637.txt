TITLE
Oncogene-induced sensescence in vitro model

SUMMARY
Analysis of transformed cell lines that either exhibit oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) triggered by MEK activation or bypass OIS. Senescent cells exist in premalignant tumors but not in malignant ones. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of OIS.
