TITLE
Desmin deficiency effect on young and adult skeletal muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of tibialis anterior muscle from 7-9 week old and 12-14 month old 129/Sv animals deficient in desmin. Skeletal muscle fibrosis develops in response to desmin depletion. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle fibrosis.
