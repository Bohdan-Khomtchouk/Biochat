TITLE
Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency effect on skeletal muscles

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscles from animals lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD). H6PD null animals develop severe skeletal myopathy characterized by switching of Type II to Type I fibers. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the myopathy induced by the absence of H6PD.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
