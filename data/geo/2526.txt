TITLE
c-MYC depletion effect on carcinoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast and cervix carcinoma cell lines depleted for c-MYC by siRNA knockdown. Abnormal activation of c-MYC contributes to breast and cervix carcinogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the developmental and oncogenic roles of MYC proteins.
