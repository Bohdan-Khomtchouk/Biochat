TITLE
CD34+ hematopoietic cells expanded in artificial matrix of fibrillar collagen I

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) expanded for 7 days in an artificial matrix of fibrillar collagen I, the major matrix component of bone. Results provide insight into the limitations of ex vivo expansion to increase the number of transplantable HSCs from cord blood.
