TITLE
Cyclophilin D deficiency effect on the heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts from mutants lacking cyclophilin D (CypD), encoded by the Ppif gene. CypD is a mitochondrial matrix peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Loss of CypD in cardiac mitochondria results in susceptibility to heart failure. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this susceptibility.
