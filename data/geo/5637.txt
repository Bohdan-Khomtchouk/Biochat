TITLE
Platelet-derived growth factor inhibitor effect on lymphocytic cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRα or ETV6-PDGFRβ

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ba/F3 cells expressing a constitutively active form of PDGFRα or PDGFRβ oncogene (Fip1L1-PDGFRα or TEL-PDGFRβ) and treated with imatinib (Glivec), a potent PDGFR inhibitor. Results provide insight into target genes of the PI3K/PKB/FOXO pathway downstream of growth factor stimulation.
