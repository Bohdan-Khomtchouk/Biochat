TITLE
Protein kinase C (PKC)ζ knockout response to chronic angiotensin treatment in vivo: heart

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart from PKCζ-deficient males subjected to continuous infusion of angiotensin II for 14 days. PKCζ knockouts do not develop cardiac hypertrophy (CH) upon chronic challenge with angiotensin II. Results provide insight into the role of PKCζ in CH.
