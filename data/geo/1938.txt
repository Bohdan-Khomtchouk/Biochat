TITLE
AMP-activated protein kinase gamma-3 knockout effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of white portions of gastrocnemius muscles from AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) gamma-3 knockout mutants. AMPK gamma-3 is important in glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and fat oxidation. Results compared to those from AMPK gamma-3 R225Q transgenic mutant (GDS1939).
