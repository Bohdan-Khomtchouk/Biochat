TITLE
Whey protein hydrolysate diet effect on exercised epitrochlearis muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of epitrochlearis muscle from males exercised for 2hr then fed a whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) diet or a control diet with an identical amino acid composition (AAM). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the greater post-exercise muscle protein synthesis in the WPH group.
