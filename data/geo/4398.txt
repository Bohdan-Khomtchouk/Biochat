TITLE
Activated diabetogenic CD8+ G9C8 clone cells and transgenic NOD/LtJ CD8 T cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of diabetogenic CD8+ G9C8 clone cells and transgenic NOD CD8 T cells. The clone and transgenic T cells display differences in their ability to kill Î² cells and induce disease in vivo. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of such differences between the two sets of CD8 T cells.
