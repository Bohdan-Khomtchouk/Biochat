TITLE
Phorbol ester effect on skin of Rho exchange factor Vav2/Vav3 double knockout mutants: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of the back skin of Rho exchange factor Vav2-/-;Vav3-/- mutants that were treated with either one or four daily applications of phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Results provide insight into the role of exchange factors Vav2 and Vav3 in TPA-triggered skin tumors.
