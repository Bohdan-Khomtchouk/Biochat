TITLE
Retina response to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas subjected to hypoxia for 6 hours and subsequent reoxygenation for up to 16 hours. Hypoxic preconditioning protects photoreceptors from light damage in animal model. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this protective effect.
