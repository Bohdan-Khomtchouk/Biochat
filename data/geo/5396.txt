TITLE
TGF-beta receptor type 1 gene Alk5 deficiency effect on embryonic tongue bud

SUMMARY
Analysis of tongue bud collected from E13.5 embryos with conditional inactivation of Alk5 in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). The Alk5 gene encodes TGF-β type 1 receptor. Results provide insight into the role of Alk5-mediated TGF-β signaling in CNCCs on early tongue myogenesis.
