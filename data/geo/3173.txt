TITLE
Homeodomain transcription factor EMX2 deficiency effect on the embryonic urogenital epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of urogenital epithelia from embryonic day 10.5 animals lacking the homeodomain transcription factor EMX2. Emx2 null mutants show severe urogenital malformations and die soon after birth due to the absence of kidneys. Results provide insight into the role of EMX2 in urogenital development.
