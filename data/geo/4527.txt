TITLE
Atherosclerosis susceptibility model: macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of macrophages from C57BL/6.MOLFc4(51Mb)-Ldlr-/- mice. This model harbors an atherosclerosis susceptibility locus and the region homologous to the human 9p21 locus associated with coronary artery disease. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of increased atherosclerotic risk.
