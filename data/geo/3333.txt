TITLE
Porphyromonas gingivalis SerB mutant infection effect on immortalized gingival epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of immortalized gingival keratinocytes (HIGKs) infected with a Porphyromonas gingivalis SerB mutant strain. SerB mutants are deficient in internalization and survival in HIGKs. Results provide insight into the role of SerB in the interaction between P. gingivalis and HIGKs.
