TITLE
Ionizing radiation effect on p53 mutant third instar larvae wing imaginal discs: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of p53 mutant larvae wing imaginal discs up to 18hr after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying IR-induced, p53-independent apoptosis in larvae.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
