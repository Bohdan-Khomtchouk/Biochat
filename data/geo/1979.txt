TITLE
Amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain effect on neural cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of neural cells induced to express amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) or the combination of AICD and its co-activator Fe65. Secretase processing of APP produces beta-amyloid, the main constituent of Alzheimer plaques, and AICD. Results identify target genes of AICD.
