TITLE
DNA methyltransferase triple knockout nuclear transfer-trophoblastic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO ntTS cells, wildtype ntTS cells, and cell types representing the three blastocyst-derived lineages: epiblast (ES cells), trophectoderm (TS cells), and primitive endoderm (XEN cells, PE cells). Results provide insight into role of DNA methylation in early embryogenesis.
