SUMMARY
Analysis of ovulatory, luteinizing follicles from a primate model of controlled ovulation at 0, 12, 24, 36 hr after exposure to an ovulatory (exogenous hCG) stimulus during the menstrual cycle. Results provide insight into molecular pathways associated with periovulatory events in primate follicle.
