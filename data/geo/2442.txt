TITLE
Insulin-like growth factor-I decrease effect on the liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals with decreased serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels. The liver is the major source of serum IGF-I. The level of serum IGF-I is correlated to bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Results provide insight into the relationship between IGF-I and BMD.
