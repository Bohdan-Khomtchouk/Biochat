TITLE
Genotoxic stress

SUMMARY
Analysis of BY4730 cells treated with DNA-reactive compounds cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and bleomycin to induce genotoxic stress. Effect of genotoxic compounds compared to cytotoxic compounds, NaCl and ethanol. Results identify an expression signature unique to genotoxic stress.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
