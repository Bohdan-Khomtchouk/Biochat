TITLE
Neural transcription factor SOX11 depletion effect on mantle cell lymphoma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of Z138 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells depleted for the neural transcription factor SOX11. SOX11 is overexpressed in aggressive lymphoid neoplasms mainly in MCL. Results provide insight into the role of SOX11 in the pathogenesis of MCL.
