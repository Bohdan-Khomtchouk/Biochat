TITLE
Nuclear and extranuclear mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein effect on cerebellum

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebella of transgenics expressing mutant huntingtin (htt) exon 1 protein in nucleus only or in both nucleus and cytoplasm. The polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in htt results in Huntington's disease (HD). Results provide insight into the impact of subcellular location of polyQ in HD.
