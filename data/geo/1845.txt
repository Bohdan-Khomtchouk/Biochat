TITLE
Retinitis pigmentosa 1 gene knockout effect on retinas: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinas of animals disrupted for the retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1) gene. Animals examined up to postnatal day 21. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant progressive RP caused by RP1 mutations and identify molecules involved early in the disease process.
