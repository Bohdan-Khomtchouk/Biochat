TITLE
Adult alveolar type 2 and embryonic bipotent progenitor lung cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of adult alveolar type (AT) 2 and E18 bipotent progenitor (BP) lung cells.  During development, AT1 and AT2 cells arise from a BP; after birth, new AT1 cells derive from rare, long-lived, self-renewing mature AT2 cells. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of AT2 self-renewal.
