TITLE
Estrogen receptor alpha positive breast cancer cells response to hyperactivation of MAPK pathway

SUMMARY
Analysis of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing constitutively active Raf-1, constitutively active MEK, constitutively active c-erbB-2, or ligand-activatable EGFR. Results indicate that increased MAPK activation results in loss of ER-alpha expression.
