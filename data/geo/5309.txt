TITLE
Sotrastaurin effect on mantle cell lymphoma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of various mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) lines treated with sotrastaurin (STN). Jeko-1 and Mino are STN-sensitive cell lines; Z-138 and Maver-1 are STN-insensitive cell lines. STN is a pan-protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Results provide insight into the molecular response to PKC inhibition.
