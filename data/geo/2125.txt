TITLE
Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 binding disruption during neuronal maturation

SUMMARY
Analysis of SH-SY5Y cells undergoing PMA-induced neuronal maturational differentiation after transfection with a MeCP2 decoy to disrupt binding of MeCP2 to endogenous targets. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MeCP2.
