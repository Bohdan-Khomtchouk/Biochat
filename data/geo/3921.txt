TITLE
Intestinal microbiota depletion effect on colon epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of colonic intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) from BALB/c males depleted of intestinal microbiota by antibiotic gavage treatment.  IECs constitute the interface between gut microbiota and host tissue. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-host interactiion.
