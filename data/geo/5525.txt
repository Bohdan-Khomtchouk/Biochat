TITLE
miR-205 silencing effect on prostate epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells following silencing of miR-205. miR-205 silenced using an antisense locked nucleic acid targeting miR-205. Results provide insight into the role of miR-205 in prostate epithelial cells.
