TITLE
Diabetes and Obesity Regulated gene abalation effect on skeletal muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of quadriceps from a muscle-specific, Diabetes and Obesity Regulated gene (DOR; Tp53inp2) knockout line (SKM-KO). Deletion of DOR results in muscle hypertrophy. Results provide insight into the functional role of DOR in skeletal muscle.

ORGANISM
