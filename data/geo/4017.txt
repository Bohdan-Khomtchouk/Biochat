TITLE
Activation of dendritic cells in NOD model of type 1 diabetes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of therapeutic-GM4 and nontherapeutic-GM bone marrow-derived NOD dendritic cells (DC) up to 20 hrs after activation with LPS + IFN-gamma. The GM4 DC population is able to prevent diabetes in NOD mice. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the therapeutic effect of GM4 DC.
