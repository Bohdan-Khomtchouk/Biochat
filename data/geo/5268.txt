TITLE
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor R547 effect on colon cancer cell line: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with the CDK inhibitor R547 at 3 doses for up to 24 hours. R547 exerts an antiproliferative effect on various cell lines. Results compared with those from PBMCs (GDS5266) and DU145 cells (GDS5267) to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers for R547.
