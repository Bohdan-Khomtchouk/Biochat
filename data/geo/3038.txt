TITLE
rrf-3 and eri-1 mutants: larvae

SUMMARY
Analysis of L4 larvae mutant for RRF-3 or ERI-1. RRF-3 and ERI-1 encode proteins required for the accumulation of endogenous secondary siRNAs. Results provide insight into the transcriptional effects caused by the loss of the RRF-3 and ERI-1 proteins and provide further insight into their functions.

ORGANISM
