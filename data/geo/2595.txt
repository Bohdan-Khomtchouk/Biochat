TITLE
gyrA parC double mutant response to norfloxacin treatment: time course (I)

SUMMARY
Analysis of C600 gyrA parC double mutants at various time points up to 30 minutes following treatment with 15 ug/ml norfloxacin. gyrA parC double mutants are resistant to norfloxacin. This is part of a study tracking transcriptional responses to over 30 chemical and physiological perturbations.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
