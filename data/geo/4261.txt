TITLE
Diel and circadian effects on adult female heads and bodies: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of heads and bodies of mated, non-blood-fed, adult females maintained under a 12hr:12hr light:dark (LD) cycle or constant dark (DD) conditions; samples were collected every 4hr for 48 hr. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms under circadian and LD cycle control.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum
