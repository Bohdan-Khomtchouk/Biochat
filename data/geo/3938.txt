TITLE
Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from schizophrenia patients

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from schizophrenic patients and differentiated to iPSC-derived neurons in vitro. Schizophrenic iPSC-derived neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms responsible for schizophrenia.
