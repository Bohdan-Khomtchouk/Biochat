TITLE
Limb bud zone of polarizing activity

SUMMARY
Analysis of zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) from limb buds of E10.5 embryos. The ZPA is a signaling center that is necessary for the normal anteroposterior patterning of the vertebrate limb. Results identify genes, beyond Sonic hedgehog (shh), expressed in the ZPA compared to the rest of the limb.
