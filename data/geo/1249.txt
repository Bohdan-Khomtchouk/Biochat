TITLE
Toll-like receptor agonists synergistic effect on dendritic cells: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist for toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, the synthetic imidazoquinoline resiquimod R848, an agonist for TLR8, or both. Provides insight into the synergistic effect of TLR agonists in activating DCs.
