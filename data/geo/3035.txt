TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to oxidative stress: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures at various time points up to 120 minutes following treatment with the oxidant cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the yeast S. cerevisiae to oxidative stress.

ORGANISM
