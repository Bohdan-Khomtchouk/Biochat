TITLE
Calyx of Held synaptic development: globular bushy cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of calyx of Held globular bushy cells at different maturation stages: P3, P8 and P21. Calyx of Held presynaptic terminals in the auditory brainstem develop into axosomatic synapses. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying development of mammalian synaptic structure and function.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
