TITLE
CD34+derived erythoblast co-culture with Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (GenePattern analysis)

SUMMARY
Analysis of growth factor-mobilized, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in vitro differentiated to day 10 (polychromatophilic stage) or day 14 (orthochromatic stage) then infected with P. falciparum for 24 hr. Results provide insight into host erythroblast cell response to infection by P. falciparum.
