TITLE
Heat-inducible transcription factor HsfA2 null mutant response to heat shock

SUMMARY
Analysis of HsfA2 null mutant following acclimative heat treatment at 37 degrees C for 1 hour, recovery at 24 degrees C for 2 days, and heat shock at 44 degrees C for 45 minutes. Results provide insight into role of HsfA2 in acquired thermotolerance induced by non-lethal heat treatment.

ORGANISM
