TITLE
mRNA splicing factor knock-down and nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA distribution

SUMMARY
Examination of cytoplasmic and nuclear mRNA distribution in D.mel2 cell line after RNAi knock-down of dU2AF50 (large subunit of pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF).  dU2AF50 knock-down analyzed in reference to non-specific RNAi knock-down.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
