SUMMARY
Analysis of purified peritoneal monocyte and macrophage (MÏ†) populations from the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 females up to 168 hrs after the induction of inflammation with IP administration of zymosan. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in the resolution of inflammation.
