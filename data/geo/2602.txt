TITLE
COX-1 or COX-2 knockout effect in brain

SUMMARY
Analysis of cortex and hippocampus in cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 knockouts. COX-1 and COX-2 produce prostanoids from arachidonic acid. Results indicate COX-1 and COX-2 differentially modulate brain gene expression, and give insight into therapeutic and toxicologic effects of COX inhibition.
