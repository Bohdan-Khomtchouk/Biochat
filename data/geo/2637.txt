TITLE
Keratinocyte cell line response to a (56)Fe ion beam

SUMMARY
Analysis of keratinocytes exposed to a (56)Fe ion beam. The (56)Fe ion beam is used as a surrogate for high-energy, heavy ion space radiation. Results provide insight into the risk at the cellular level to irradiation during space travel.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
