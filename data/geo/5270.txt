TITLE
Infarct volume-variant inbred strains at two developmental stages: cerebral cortex

SUMMARY
Analysis of cerebral cortex from C57BL/6J and C3H/J strains at post-natal day 1 and week 11. These strains share similar collateral vessel anatomy but exhibit significantly different infarct volume. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms modulating infarct volume.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
