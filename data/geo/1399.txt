TITLE
DNA adenine methyltransferase and mismatch repair mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of mutants lacking DNA adenine methyltransferase Dam, or mismatch repair protein MutS, or both. Results help elucidate the global changes resulting from Dam deficiency and the role of mismatch repair in producing these changes.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12
