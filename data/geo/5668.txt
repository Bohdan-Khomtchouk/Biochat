TITLE
Macrophage-restricted interleukin-10 receptor deficiency effect on colonic resident macrophages

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS-sorted, interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R)-deficient intestinal macrophages from 6-week-old C57BL/6 animals. IL-10 is a pleiotropic anti-inflammatory cytokine. Results provide insight into the role of IL-10 sensing by intestinal macrophages in gut homeostasis.
