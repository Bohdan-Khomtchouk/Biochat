TITLE
Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 deficient CD4 T cell response to T cell receptor stimulation

SUMMARY
Analysis of Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) deficient CD4 T cells after T cell receptor stimulation using anti-CD3-CD28. Tsc1 is an mTOR signaling modulator involved in naive T cell quiescence and immune homeostasis regulation. Results provide insight into the role of Tsc1 in T cell quiescence.
