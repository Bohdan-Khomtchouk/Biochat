TITLE
Transgenic and conventional cultivar comparison

SUMMARY
Analysis of the first trifoliate leaves of two transgenic and three conventional soybean cultivars. To date, the possibility that transgene expression could lead to unintended effects remains a debated issue. Results provide insight into the overall molecular changes in transgenic soybean cultivars.
