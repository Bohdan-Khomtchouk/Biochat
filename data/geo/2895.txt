TITLE
Stem development

SUMMARY
Analysis of sections from 5 and 10 cm long ecotype Ler bolting stems. Different stages of vascular and interfascicular fiber differentiation can be identified along the axis of bolting stems. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling this pattern of development.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
