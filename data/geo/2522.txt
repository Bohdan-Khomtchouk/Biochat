TITLE
Pyocyanin treatment: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells treated with 25 or 250 ug/ml of the blue metabolite pyocyanin for 6 hours. Pyocyanin, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, kills cells by generating reactive oxygen species. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress response to pyocyanin.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
