TITLE
Nematode models of primary mitochondrial dysfunction: complex I, II, and III mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of 8 different electron transport chain (ETC) subunit mutants (3 missense and 5 RNAi-induced) in complexes I, II, and III. Results from this validation set provide insight into the contributions of individual complexes or subunits to primary mitochondrial dysfunction.
