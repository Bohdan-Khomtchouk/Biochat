TITLE
Trib1-deficient macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide

SUMMARY
Analysis of Trib1-deficient macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Trib1 is a serine/threonine kinase-like protein. LPS activates toll-like receptors (TLRs) to stimulate host immune responses. Results provide insight into the function of Trib1 in TLR-mediated responses.
