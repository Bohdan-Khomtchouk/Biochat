TITLE
Linker histone H1 depletion

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells from histone H1c, H1d, H1e triple null mutants. The triple-H1 null ES cells have close to a 50% reduction in H1 content. Results provide insight into the mechanisms by which linker H1 affects chromatin structure and gene transcription in vivo.
