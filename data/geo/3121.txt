TITLE
Rhizobial bacteroids from determinate soybean root nodules: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of soybean nodules at 10, 13, 21, and 31 days postinoculation, having relative symbiotic nitrogen-fixation activities of 9, 95, 100, and 61%, respectively. Results provide insight into genes expressed early and late in bacteroid development.

ORGANISM
