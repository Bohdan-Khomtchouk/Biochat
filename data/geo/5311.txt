TITLE
Lipopolysaccharide effect on fatty acid-loaded peritoneal macrophages in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of fatty acid (FA)-loaded macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that promote triglyceride retention in LPS-exposed macrophages.
