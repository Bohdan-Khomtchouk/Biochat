TITLE
Nematode model of primary mitochondrial dysfunction: complex I mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of gas-1(fc21) electron transport chain complex I mutants.  The gas-1(fc21) mutation affects the 49 kD subunit of complex I, decreasing the rate of complex I-dependent oxidative phosphorylation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying primary mitochondrial disease .
