TITLE
Phosphate deficiency effect on roots: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of roots from plants grown in the absence of phosphate (Pi) for up to 24 hrs. Pi deficiency-induces the formation of root hairs with increased length and density. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in acclimating plants to low Pi availability.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
