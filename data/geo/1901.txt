TITLE
Strains exhibiting low or high freezing in response to fear: amygdala and hippocampus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the amygdalae and hippocampi of strains exhibiting low or high freezing behavior in response to fear.  Previous work identified alleles that contribute to the variability in freezing behavior, and the chromosomal location of these alleles.

ORGANISM
