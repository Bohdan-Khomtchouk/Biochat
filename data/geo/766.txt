TITLE
Osteoclastogenesis regulation by c-Fos and Nfat

SUMMARY
Analysis of the role of c-Fos and Nfat in osteoclastogenesis by expression profiling of osteoclastogenic splenocytes lacking c-Fos but with an active Nfatc4.  Active Nfatc4 introduced into cells by retroviral gene transfer.  Osteoclastogenesis restored by active Nfatc4 in splenocytes lacking c-Fos.
