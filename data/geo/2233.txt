TITLE
Circadian clock deficient Per2/Cry1 double mutant adrenal gland in constant darkness: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of adrenal glands of Per2/Cry1 double mutant animals at 46 and 54 hours after transferring the animals from a light-day cycle to constant darkness. Per2/Cry1 double mutants lack a circadian clock. Results identify clock-regulated genes in the adrenal that are not necessarily rhythmic.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
