TITLE
Hypoxia and 2-oxoglutrate-dependent dioxygenase inhibition (HG-U133A)

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells exposed to hypoxia or treated with the non-specific 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) dependent dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine. Results provide insight into the role of 2-OG dioxygenases in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia.
