TITLE
Prefrontal cortex postnatal development: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) of animals at 2 to 10 weeks of age. Although the basic laminar structure of the PFC is established in utero, extensive remodeling continues into adolescence. Results map the overall pattern of changes in cortical gene transcripts during postnatal development.
