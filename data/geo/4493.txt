TITLE
Transcription factor Trps1 GATA-domain deletion effect on embryonic whisker pads

SUMMARY
Analysis of whisker pads from E12.5 embryos in which the GATA domain of Trps1 has been deleted. Trps1∆gt/∆gt mutants have fewer pelage follicles and lack vibrissae follicles postnatally. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying vibrissa follicle morphogenesis.
