TITLE
Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 deficiency effect on the regenerating liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of regenerating livers of animals bearing a hepatocyte-specific Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 gene (SOCS3) knockout. SOCS3 down-regulates several signaling pathways in multiple cell types. Results provide insight into the role of SOCS3 in liver regeneration.
