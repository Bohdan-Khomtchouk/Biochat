TITLE
Mucociliary differentiation of airway epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface for up to 28 days to induce their differentiation into polarized, pseudostratified epithelia of ciliated and mucus-secreting cells. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying mucociliary differentiation.
