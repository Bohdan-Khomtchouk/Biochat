TITLE
Truncated CBF beta-SMMHC defective in high-affinity binding with RUNX1 effect on spleen cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of spleen cells from animals expressing a truncated form of CBF beta-SMMHC lacking the RUNX1 high-affinity binding domain (HABD). The type I CBF beta-SMMHC fusion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients lacks HABD. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia.
