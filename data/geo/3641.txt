TITLE
Methyltransferase Hypb deficiency effect on the yolk sac during development

SUMMARY
Analysis of yolk sacs from E9 and E10.5 embryos lacking Hypb, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methytransferase.  Hypb deficiency results in lethality at E10.5-E11.5 and severe vascular defects in the embryo, yolk sac, and placenta. Results provide insight into the function of Hypb in development.
