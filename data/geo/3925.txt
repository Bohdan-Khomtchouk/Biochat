TITLE
Inflammasome-compromised epidydimal white adipose response to a high fat diet

SUMMARY
Analysis of white adipose tissue from inflammasome (IFS) Caspase 1 null (Casp1-/-) and IFS adapter null (ASC-/-) C57/Bl6 males after 16 weeks of high fat diet (HFD) feeding. The mutants were resistant to HFD-induced obesity. Results provide insight into role of IFS in obesity and insulin resistance.
