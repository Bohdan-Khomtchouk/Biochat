TITLE
Acute myeloblastic leukemia cells response to all trans retinoic acid and valproic acid

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cell line, OCI/AML-2, following treatment with valproic acid (VPA) and all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). VPA inhibits histone deacetylase. Results provide insight into the responsiveness of AML cells to ATRA when VPA is present.
