TITLE
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor R547 effect on prostate cancer cell line: dose response and time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of DU145 prostate cancer cells treated with the CDK inhibitor R547 at 3 doses for up to 24 hours. R547 exerts an antiproliferative effect on various cell lines. Results compared with those from PBMCs (GDS5266) and HCT116 cells (GDS5268) to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers for R547.
