TITLE
Terephthalate effect on Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1

SUMMARY
Analysis of Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1 cells exposed to the pollutant phthalate (PTH) or terephthalate (TPA). Phthalate esters are used as plastic additives. RHA1 is able to degrade a wide range of aromatic compounds including PTH. Results provide insight into the ability of RHA1 to degrade TPA.

ORGANISM
