TITLE
Histone H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 deletion effect on primary preadipocyte cultures

SUMMARY
Analysis of preadipocytes deficient in Ezh2, the enzymatic  subunit of H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2. Deletion of Ezh2 eliminates H3K27me3 on Wnt promoters leading to activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and inhibition of adipogenesis. Results provide insight into the role of PRC2 in adipogenesis.
