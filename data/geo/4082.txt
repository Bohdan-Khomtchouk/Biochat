TITLE
Trans-retinoic acid and hydrocortisone induction of Na+/I- symporter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of MCF7 cells induced to express endogenous Na+/I- symporter (NIS). NIS expression raises potential for radionuclide therapy of breast cancer. However, NIS expression in most breast cancers is low. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying NIS modulation in breast cancer.
