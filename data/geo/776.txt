TITLE
Interferon-alpha effect on monocytes primed with interferon-gamma

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of monocytes cultured for 2 days with 150 pg/ml interferon (IFN) gamma and then stimulated with 25 ng/ml of IFN-alpha.  Monocytes obtained from 3 donors.  Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying the enhanced response of IFN primed monocytes to cytokines.
