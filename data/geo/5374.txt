TITLE
Histone/protein acetyltransferase (HAT) deficiency effect on Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells from C57Bl/6 mice deficient in p300 or CBP (a p300 paralog). p300 and CBP are histone/protein acetyltransferases (HATs). Results provide insight into mechanisms by which HATs affect Treg biology.
