TITLE
Bisphenol A effect on endometrial cell line: time course and dose response

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of Ishikawa endometrial cells treated with various concentrations of bishpenol A (BPA). BPA is a very weak environmental estrogen given its low estrogen receptor affinity. Ishikawa cells represent a model to study the endometrial epithelium response to estrogen exposure in vitro.
