TITLE
Topoisomerase IIbeta deficiency effect on the developing embryonic brain

SUMMARY
Anlaysis of brains from topoisomerase IIbeta (TopIIbeta) deficient embryos at various ages up to embryonic day 18.5. TopIIbeta null animals exhibit a perinatal death phenotype. Results provide insight into the role of TopIIbeta at the late stages of neuronal differentiation.
