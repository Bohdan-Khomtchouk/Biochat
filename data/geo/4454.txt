TITLE
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 depletion effect on bladder cancer cell line RT112

SUMMARY
Analysis of bladder cancer cell line RT112 subjected to doxycycline-inducible, shRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Knockdown of FGFR3 in RT112 cells significantly attenuates tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying FGFR3-driven bladder cancer.
