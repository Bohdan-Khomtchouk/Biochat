TITLE
Mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition effect on Hs294T melanoma cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of Hs294T melanoma cells following three different treatments that induce the mesenchymal to amoeboid transition (MAT) in melanoma cells: EphA2 overexpression, Ilomastat treatment, or RhoA activator Calpeptin treatment. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying MAT.
