TITLE
Retina response to optic nerve injury: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of retinas of animals following intraorbital optic nerve transection (IONT) or intraorbital nerve crush (IONC). Optic nerve injury, which is more severe with IONT than IONC, triggers retinal ganglion cell death. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this degeneration.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
