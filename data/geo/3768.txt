TITLE
Fat-Specific protein 27 knockout effect on white adipose tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) from Fat-Specific protein 27 (FSP27)-null males. FSP27-null WATs have reduced lipid storage, smaller lipid droplets, and increased mitochondrial activity. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which FSP27 controls lipid storage in WAT.
