TITLE
αSMA+ myofibroblast late depletion effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors from PKT; αSMA-tk+ transgenics injected daily with ganciclovir at 6 weeks of age for 10 days or less to selectively deplete αSMA+ myofibroblasts. Results provide insight into the role of αSMA+ myofibroblasts in late-stage PDAC.
