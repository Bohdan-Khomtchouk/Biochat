TITLE
DNA-binding protein SPT10 mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of spt10 null deletion and spt10(C388S) mutants. SPT10 encodes a putative histone acetyltranferase implicated as a global transcription regulator and is involved in chromatin maintenance. The C388S mutation disrupts a predicted zinc finger that may be part of the DNA-binding domain.
