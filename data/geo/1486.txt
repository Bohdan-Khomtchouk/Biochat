TITLE
Serum response factor null mutation effect on neonatal cardiomyocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of serum response factor (SRF)-null neonatal cardiomyocytes. SRF is a transcriptional regulator required for mesodermal development and implicated in myogenesis. Results provide insight into the role of SRF in regulating genetic programs important for controlling cardiomyocyte function.
