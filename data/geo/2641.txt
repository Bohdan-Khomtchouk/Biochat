TITLE
IRAK-4 kinase deficient fibroblast response to IL-1: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts from IRAK-4 kinase deficient mutants following stimulation with IL-1beta for 1 or 4 hours. Results provide insight into the role of IRAK-4 in the inflammatory responses mediated by the IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor 7.
