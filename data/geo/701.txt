TITLE
Spermatogonial stem cell activity in testis laminin binding germ cells (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Comparison of cultured laminin binding to non-binding germ cells from testes of 19 day old neonates.  Laminin binding germ cells are enriched in spermatogonial stem cells.  Results provide insight into molecular events underlying stem cell activity.
