TITLE
αSMA+ myofibroblast early depletion effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors from PKT; αSMA-tk+ transgenics injected daily with ganciclovir at 4 to 4.5 weeks of age for 14 days or less to selectively deplete αSMA+ myofibroblasts. Results provide insight into the role of αSMA+ myofibroblasts in early-stage PDAC.
