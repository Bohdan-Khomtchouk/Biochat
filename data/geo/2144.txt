TITLE
Cochlear nucleus postnatal development

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochlear nucleus (CN) at postnatal days 7 (P7), 14, and 21. Deprivation of auditory nerve input from P7 to P14 results in neuron death in the anteroventral CN. Results provide insight into the molecular basis underlying this critical period of susceptibility to loss of afferent input.
