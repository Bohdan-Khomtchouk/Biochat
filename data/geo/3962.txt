TITLE

Analysis of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from a body mass index (BMI)-matched, morbidly-obese cohort of patients that are either insulin-sensitive or insulin-resistant. Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying obesity-related insulin resistance independent of BMI.
