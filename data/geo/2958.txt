TITLE
Tumor suppressor PTEN depletion effect on various cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of A431, HCC827, and SKBR-3 carcinoma cell lines depleted for the tumor suppressor PTEN. Inactivation of PTEN is a common genetic lesion in cancer. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the oncogenic phenotypes resulting from PTEN deficiency.
