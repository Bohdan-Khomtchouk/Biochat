TITLE
Suspension cell cultures response to overexpression of master regulators VND6 and SND1

SUMMARY
Analysis of suspension cell lines in which VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN6 (VND6) or SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATES NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1) was overexpressed after the addition of estrogen. Results provide insight in to the roles of master regulators VND6 and SND1 in xylem development.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
