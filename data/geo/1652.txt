TITLE
POU-domain transcription factor Brn3a knockout effect on embryonic ganglia (MG-U74B)

SUMMARY
Analysis of embryonic day 13.5 trigeminal ganglia of Brn3a knockout mutants. Brn3a encodes a POU-domain transcription factor. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the essential role of the Brn3a protein in normal axon growth and neuronal survival.
