TITLE
Histone methyltransferase MMSET overexpression effect on KMS11 multiple myeloma cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of KMS11 t(4;14) MM parental cell line with a normal overexpressed multiple myeloma SET domain containing protein (MMSET) and cell lines knocked out for MMSET on the translocated allele (TKO) or on the non-translocated allele (NTKO). Results provide insight into role of MMSET in t(4;14) MM.
