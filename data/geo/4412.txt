TITLE
Dietary fatty acid composition effect on vastus lateralis muscle

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle (SM) from insulin resistant men 4 hrs after consumption of meals high in saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA), or polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Results provide insight into mechanisms underlying effects of FA composition on SM FA handling and insulin sensitivity.
