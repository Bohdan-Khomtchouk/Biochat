TITLE
Carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone effect on Bacillus subtilis: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of B. subtilis cultured in a defined minimal medium at pH 6.4 in batch fermentors and treated with 0.85 Î¼M carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Results provide insight into the molecular response of food spoilage bacteria sub-lethally stressed with weak organic acids.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis
