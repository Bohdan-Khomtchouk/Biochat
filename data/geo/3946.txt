TITLE
Dexamethasone effect on cultured airway smooth muscle cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells treated with glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone for 4 or 24h. GCs are used to treat asthma, exerting their therapeutic effects in part through modulating ASM structure/function. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying GC action in ASM.
