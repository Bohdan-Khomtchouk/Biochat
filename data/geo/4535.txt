TITLE
Differentiating glioblastoma-initiating cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of cultures of progenitor and 4-day differentiated glioblastoma cells (GICs) derived from surgical specimens.  Following induction of differentiation, NFÎºB is activated in GICs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the control of differentiation of GICs.
