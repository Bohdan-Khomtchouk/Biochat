TITLE
Mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the developing intestine

SUMMARY
Analysis of the mesenchymal and epithelial fractions of the embryonic small intestine. Crosstalk between the epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme is required for intestinal development. Results provide insight into the role of the mesenchyme in the determination of the epithelial phenotype.
