TITLE
Treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients: CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes

SUMMARY
Analysis of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) patients with high or low viral loads. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying functional impairment differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells  during CHC infection.
