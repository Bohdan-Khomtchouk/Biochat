TITLE
Structural bone autograft and allograft comparison

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of autografted and allografted femurs of 8 week old C57BL/6 animals. Allografts obtained from ICR animals and grafted onto C57BL/6 femurs. Bone remodeling and vascularization in autografts is superior to that in allografts. Results identify genes important in autograft healing.
