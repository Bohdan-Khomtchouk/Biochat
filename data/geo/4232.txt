TITLE
HIV infection effect on interferon alpha 2-treated monocyte-derived macrophages: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of macrophages pretreated for 18hrs with interferon alpha 2 (IFNÎ±2) then infected with HIV-1 (Bal strain). IFN treatment prior to in vitro HIV infection inhibits virus replication. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this modulation of viral replication.
