TITLE
Vascular endothelial cell differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of VEGF receptor Flk1-expressing cells isolated from embryoid bodies up to 8 days post-differentiation. Flk1-expressing cells have developmental potential uniquely restricted to hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Results provide insight into early vascular development.
