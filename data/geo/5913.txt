TITLE
SRPIN803 small molecule inhibitor of SRPK1 effect on retinal pigment epithelial cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells treated with SRPIN803, a small molecule inhibitor of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 SRPK1. SRPK1 inhibition prevents pathological angiogenesis. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory activity of SRPIN803.
