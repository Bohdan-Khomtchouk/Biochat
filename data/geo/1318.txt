TITLE
Hormone-sensitive lipase inactivation effect on muscle

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of soleus muscle from females lacking the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) gene. HSL is a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization in adipocytes and found to be active in skeletal muscle. Results provide insight into the role of HSL in muscle lipid metabolism.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
