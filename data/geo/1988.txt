TITLE
Airway disease trait manifestation in various genetic backgrounds: lungs (MG-U74C)

SUMMARY
Analysis of lungs of animals exhibiting extremes in airway hyperreactivity, goblet cell metaplasia, or both. Animals were derived from an intercross of an F1 hybrid strain, generated by crossing C57Bl/6J and Balb/cJ strains. Results provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex airway diseases.
