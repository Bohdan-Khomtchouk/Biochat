TITLE
Acute myeloid leukemia fusion oncogenes in vitro effect on primary CD34+ cells: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD34+ cells nucleofected (6h) or transduced (3d, 8d) with AML leukemia fusion oncogenes: AML1-ETO, MLL-AF9, PML-RARA or NUP98-HOXA9. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of fusion oncogene-driven leukemogenesis and early temporal patterns of gene deregulation in AML.
