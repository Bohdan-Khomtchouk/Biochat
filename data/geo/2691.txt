TITLE
Serine/threonine kinase Tao-1 dominant negative mutation effect on pole cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of pole cells overexpressing a dominant negative Tao-1 mutation. Tao-1 is a member of a conserved family of ste20-related serine/threonine kinases that regulate fundamental cellular processes including apoptosis. Results identify genes regulated by Tao-1 in pole cells undergoing apoptosis.

ORGANISM
