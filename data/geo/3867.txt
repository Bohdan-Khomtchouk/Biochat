TITLE
Comparison of induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells (melanocytes, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes) representing all 3 embryonic germ layers, embryonic stem (ES) cell lines (H1, H7, H9) and their embryoid bodies. Results suggest iPS cells retain a memory of the original somatic cells.
