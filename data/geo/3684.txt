TITLE
Catecholamine stress effect on hearts of beta2 adrenergic receptor deficient mutants

SUMMARY
Analysis of hearts of various wild type and beta2 adrenergic receptor (B2KO) deficient animals subjected to catecholamine (CA) stress by beta receptor agonist isoproterenol treatment. B2KO mutants and FVB wild type animals develop left ventricle systolic dysfunction in response to CA stress.
