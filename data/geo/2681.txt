TITLE
Caloric restriction effect on aged cochlea

SUMMARY
Analysis of cochleas of 15 month old C57BL/6 (B6) animals on a calorie restricted diet. The B6 strain is a model of age-related hearing loss or presbycusis. Caloric restriction (CR) prevents late-onset presbycusis in B6. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of this effect of CR.
