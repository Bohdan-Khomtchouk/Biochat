TITLE
RhoGTP dissociation inhibitor 2 effect on UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of UM-UC-3 bladder carcinoma cells (low RhoGDI2-expressing and highly metastatic) stably transfected with GFP-RhoGDI2. RhoGDI2 is a metastasis suppressor protein. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of RhoGD12-mediated blockage of prometastatic inflammatory host response.
