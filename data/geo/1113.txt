TITLE
CD4+ T cells expressing transcription factor Foxp3 and various amounts of CD25

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD4+/CD25lo, CD4+/CD25+, and CD4+/CD25hi T cells expressing the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3. FACS used to sort CD4+ cells based on Foxp3 GFP fusion protein and CD25 expression. Results provide insight into the role of Foxp3 in regulatory T cell development and function.
