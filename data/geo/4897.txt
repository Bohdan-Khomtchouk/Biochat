TITLE
Skeletal muscle of patients with inherited insulin resistance

SUMMARY
Analysis of muscle from patients with a mutation (Arg1174Gln) in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene (INSR). This mutation is associated with inherited insulin resistance. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
