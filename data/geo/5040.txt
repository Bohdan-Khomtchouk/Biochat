TITLE
V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2 knockdown effect on lung cancer cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of H441 lung cancer cells transfected with siRNA targeting V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2 (ETS2). ETS2 transcription factor is an evolutionarily conserved gene that is deregulated in cancer. Results provide insight into the role of ETS2 in lung cancer.
