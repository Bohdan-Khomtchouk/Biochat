TITLE
Endothelial cells from P8 neonatal retina [MG_U74Cv2]

SUMMARY
Analysis of FACS-sorted, GFP-positive endothelial cells from retinas of postnatal day 8 (P8) homozygous Tie2-GFP transgenics. Deregulated retinal angiogenesis causes vision loss in many ocular diseases. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying intraretinal angiogenesis.
