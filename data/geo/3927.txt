TITLE
Salt stress effect on multiple genotypes: leaf

SUMMARY
Analysis of leaf from salt-stressed plants with genotypes Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col) and single gene mutation (glabrous, gl1-1) in the Col background. Ws plants had the least salt injury. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying variation in salt stress responses.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
