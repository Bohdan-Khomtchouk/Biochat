TITLE
Anoxia effect on rice coleoptiles

SUMMARY
Analysis of coleoptiles of rice grown under anaerobic conditions. Rice seeds are capable of germinating in the absence of oxygen. Under anoxia, rice coleoptiles reach lengths greater than that of aerobically grown rice. Results provide insight into the control of anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa
