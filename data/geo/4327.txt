TITLE
Human hepatocytes from xenogeneic host livers

SUMMARY
Analysis of hepatocytes isolated from chimeric mouse livers repopulated with human hepatocytes (c-heps) or from normal human livers (h-heps). Results provide insight into the potential use of chimeric mice as a relevant model for human liver biomedical experiments.
