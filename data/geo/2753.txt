TITLE
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli biofilm response to 7-hydroxyindole and isatin

SUMMARY
Analysis of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli biofilm treated with 7-hydroxyindole or oxidized indole (isatin). Many bacterial oxygenases readily convert indole, an interspecies biofilm signal, into oxidized compounds. Results provide insight into the role of oxidized indoles in biofilm formation.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
