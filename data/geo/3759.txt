TITLE
Onconase effect on mesothelioma cells in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines (M25, M29, and M49) exposed to Onconase for 24 hrs. Onconase, an RNA damaging therapeutic agent, induces apoptosis in MM cells. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Onconase action in MM.
