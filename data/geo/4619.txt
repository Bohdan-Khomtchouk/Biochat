TITLE
Palatal mesenchymal cells response to TGFβ2 stimulation in the presence of Tak1 kinase and TGFβRI inhibitors

SUMMARY
Analysis of palatal mesenchymal cells treated with TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (Tak1) inhibitor or TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβRI) kinase inhibitor for 1hr and then stimulated with TGF-β2 for 2 hrs. Results provide insight into TGFβ signaling mechanisms involved in craniofacial development.
