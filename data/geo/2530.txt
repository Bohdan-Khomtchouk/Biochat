TITLE
Retinoblastomas with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 16q

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 retinoblastomas with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 16q. In addition to RB1 gene mutations, retinoblastomas frequently show gains of 1q and 6p and losses of 16q. Results identify candidate tumor suppressors on 16q in retinoblastoma.
