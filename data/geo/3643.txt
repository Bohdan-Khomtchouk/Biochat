TITLE
D-serine effect on the brain: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of forebrains of animals treated with up to 500 mg/kg D-serine for 96 hours. D-serine is involved in many physiological processes through its interaction with the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. Results provide insight into the impact of D-serine exposure on neuronal functions.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
