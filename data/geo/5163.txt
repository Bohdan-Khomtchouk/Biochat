TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzymes AhpCF, KatE and KatG deficiency

SUMMARY
Analysis of Hpx- (ahpCF::kanR, katG, katE) triple deletion mutant. H202 scavenging is performed by the three hydrogen enzymes: alkyl hydroperoxidase reductase (AhpCF), catalase G (KatG) and catalase E (KatE). Results provide insight into molecular basis of the oxidative stress response in bacteria.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli
