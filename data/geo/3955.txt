TITLE
Polychlorobiphenyl coplanar congener PCB-77 effect on liver cell line

SUMMARY
Analysis of a metabolically competent liver cell line HepG2 exposed to coplanar PCB-77, a prototype congener of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB). Different congeners of PCB lead to varying degrees of cellular oxidative stress. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of coplanar PCB congeners.
