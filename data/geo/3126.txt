TITLE
Radioresistant tumor response to interferons

SUMMARY
Analysis of nu61 radioresistant tumors following treatment with a mixture of interferons (IFNs) alpha, beta, and gamma. Nu61 tumors derived from the radiosensitive squamous cell carcinoma cell line SCC61. Results provide insight into the role of the IFN signaling pathway in tumor radioresistance.
