Trophoblast stem cell differentiation in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines TS3.5 and TS6.5 derived from 2 time points during embryogenesis (from blastocyst and E6.5 embryos, respectively) and differentiated over 6 days. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of trophoblast development.
