TITLE
Postinfarction heart failure model: peripheral blood mononuclear cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMCs from males subjected to left coronary artery ligation to induce large myocardial infarctions (MI). Only animals with large MIs develop LV remodeling and heart failure (HF). Results provide insight into the molecular basis of the progression of LV remodeling and HF.
