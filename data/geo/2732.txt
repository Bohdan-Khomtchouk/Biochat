TITLE
2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylamino)-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine effect on epidermal keratinocytes: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of epidermal keratinocytes at various time points up to 48 hours following treatment with 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylamino)-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (PP). PP induces the terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Results provide insight into the mechanism of action of PP.
