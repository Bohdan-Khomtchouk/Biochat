TITLE
Sonic hedgehog homolog-stimulated fibroblasts

SUMMARY
Analysis of CCD-18Co colon myofibroblasts stimulated with Sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH) for 72hr. Hedgehog (Hh)-driven, CCD-18Co proangiogenic signals drive tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Hh regulation of tumor angiogenesis.
