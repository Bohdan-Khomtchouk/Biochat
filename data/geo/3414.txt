TITLE
Pulmonary embolism model: right heart ventricles

SUMMARY
Analysis of right ventricles (RV) of animals for up to 18 hours after injection with polystyrene microsphere beads to induce pulmonary embolism (PE). Animals injected with 1.3 or 2.0 million microspheres/100g body weight. Results provide insight into the mechanisms leading to RV failure after PE.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
