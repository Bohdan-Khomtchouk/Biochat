TITLE
Microbioreactor-grown cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of cells grown in glucose or galactose media in 150 microliter bioreactors equipped with sensors for measuring optical density, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Results provide insight into the feasibility of integrating high-throughput studies of growth physiology with global gene expression.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
