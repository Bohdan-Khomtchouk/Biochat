TITLE
not1-2 spt3 double mutant

SUMMARY
Analysis of not1-2 spt3 double mutant cells. NOT1 encodes the scaffold subunit of the Ccr4-Not transcription factor complex. SPT3 encodes a transcription factor. The temperature sensitive not1-2 mutant exhibits transcriptional defects that are suppressed by the deletion of SPT3.

ORGANISM
