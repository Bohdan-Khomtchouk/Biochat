TITLE
Saracatinib-sensitive versus -resistant, PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer xenografts

SUMMARY
Analysis of patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts with a PIK3CA mutation with enhanced sensitivity to Src inhibitor saracatinib. Dysregulation of Src and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathways is common in CRC. Results provide insight into CRC model response to saracatinib.
