TITLE
Anticarcinogen 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione effect on liver

SUMMARY
Analysis of livers of animals treated with 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T). D3T blocks carcinogenesis through induction of phase 2 enzymes that enhance the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds. Results provide insight into the regulatory pathways affected by D3T.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
