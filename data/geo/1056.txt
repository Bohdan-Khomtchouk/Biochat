TITLE
Type 1 diabetes model response to cyclophosphamide: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of pancreatic islets from BDC2.5/NOD transgenics after treatment with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY) at various time points up to 3 days.  CY induces diabetes in BDC2.5/NOD transgenics.  Results provide insight into molecular events accompanying the progression from insulitis to diabetes.
