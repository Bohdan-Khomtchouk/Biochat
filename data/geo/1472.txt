TITLE
Transcription factor Spotted-dick knockdown

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cultured S2 cells following inactivation of spotted-dick, a gene encoding a zinc finger transcriptional activator of S phase genes. RNAi used to inactivate spotted-dick. Results identify potential downstream targets of Spotted-dick.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster
