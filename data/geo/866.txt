TITLE
Spatial gene expression in flowers (oligo array)

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profiles of inflorescences of the floral homeotic mutants apetala1, apetala2, apetala3, pistillata, and agamous with that of wild type plants. Several genes predicted to have floral organ-specific expression patterns.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
