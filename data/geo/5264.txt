TITLE
High-fat diet effect on obesity-resistant NAG-1 transgenics: colon epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of colon epithelium from NAG-1 (NSAID-activated gene-1) transgenics and wild-type C57BL/6J animals fed a high-fat diet for 20wk. The NAG-1 transgenics did not gain weight as their wild-type counterparts did. Results provide insight into the molecular impact of obesity on colonic epithelium.
