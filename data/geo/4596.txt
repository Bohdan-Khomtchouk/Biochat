TITLE
Colorectal cancer cell line SW480 response to Snail overexpression

SUMMARY
Analysis of SW480 CRC cells stably overexpressing Snail, an EMT activator highly expressed in CRC colonospheres. SW480-Snail cells display most properties of colonospheres, including cell dedifferentiation. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying EMT-related malignancy.
