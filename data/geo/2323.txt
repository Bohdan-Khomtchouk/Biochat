TITLE
Estrogen-starved breast cancer cell line: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer MCF7/BUS cells starved of estrogen for up to 2 days. Results compared to that from an experiment (GDS2324) examining the response to low concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2). Results provide insight into the E2 sensitivity of E2 inducible or suppressible genes.
