TITLE
Cigarette smoking effect on the nasal epithelium

SUMMARY
Analysis of nasal epithelia from cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoke creates a field of injury in epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. Results extend the concept of a smoking-induced field of injury beyond intrathoracic (bronchial) epithelia to extrathoracic epithelia that line the nose.
