TITLE
Glioblastoma stem-like cell lines, glioblastomas, and glioma cell lines

SUMMARY
Analysis of glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines, corresponding glioblastoma primary tumors, conventional glioma cell lines, and GS neurospheres. Results provide insight into cell lines recapitulating transcriptional aspects of glioblastomas, thereby allowing identification of therapeutic targets.
