TITLE
Molecular clock effect on distal nephron segments: time course

SUMMARY
Temporal analysis of microdissected distal nephron convoluted/connecting tubules (DCT/CNT) or cortical collecting ducts (CCD). Renal excretion of water and major electrolytes exhibits a significant circadian rhythm. Results provide insight into the role of molecular clock in renal function.
