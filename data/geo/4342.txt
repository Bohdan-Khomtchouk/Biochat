TITLE
Gamma secretase inhibitor MRK-003 effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor xenografts

SUMMARY
Analysis of 9 individual patient-derived, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenografts treated with GSI MRK-003. MRK-003 monotherapy significantly reduced tumor volume in 5 of 9 xenografts. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of MRK-003-mediated attenuation of PDAC.
