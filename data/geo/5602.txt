TITLE
Transcription factor Inhibitor of differentiation 3 knockout effect on invariant natural killer T cells: developmental time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of stage 1 (Tet+CD24-CD44-NK1.1-) and stage 2 (Tet+CD24-CD44+NK1.1-) invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells FACS-sorted from inhibitor of differentiation 3 (Id3) knockout thymus. Results provide insight into the role of transcriptional regulator ID3 during iNKT cell maturation in thymus.
