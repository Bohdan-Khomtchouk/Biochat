TITLE
Wnt4 mutation effect on female embryonic gonads

SUMMARY
Analysis of gonads from Wnt4 homozygous mutant female embryos. In Wnt4 mutant female gonads, endothelial cells migrate from the mesonephros and form a male-like coelomic vessel. Results provide insight into the regulation of sex specific vascular development.

ORGANISM
