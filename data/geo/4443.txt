Homeobox transcription factor Dlx5 deficiency effect on embryonic otic vesicle

SUMMARY
Analysis of otic vesicles from E10 and E10.5 embryos deficient for Dlx5. Dlx5 is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a key role in the development of many organ systems. Results provide insight into the role of Dlx5 in the regulation of early inner ear development.
