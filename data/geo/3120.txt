TITLE
Rhizobial bacteroids from determinate soybean root nodules

SUMMARY
Analysis of bacteroids harvested from soybean nodules at 21 days postinoculation (dpi), a timepoint of maximal nitrogen-fixation activity.  Free-living cells grown in aerobic or microaerobic culture also examined. Results provide insight into the genetic basis underlying the conversion to symbiosis.

ORGANISM
