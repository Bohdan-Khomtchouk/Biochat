TITLE
TGF-beta receptor type II knockdown effect on embryonic palatal tissue

SUMMARY
Analysis of palatal tissues from E14.5 animals depleted for f TGF-beta receptor type II in cranial neural crest cells. Palatal fusion takes place at E14.5. Results provide insight into the role of TGF-beta signaling in palate development.
