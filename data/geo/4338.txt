TITLE
Cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression or deletion effect on the K-ras/Pten pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma murine model

SUMMARY
Analysis of PDACs from mutants with pancreatic-specific Pten loss (Pten +/-) and K-ras activation (K-rasG12D) and either COX-2 over-expression (Cox-2 COE) or knockout (Cox-2 KO) under regulation of the Pdx-1 promoter. Results provide insight into the role of COX-2 in pancreatic cancer development.
