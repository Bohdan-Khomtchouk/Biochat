TITLE
Erythroid and non-erythroid granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of FACS-isolated erythroid progenitor and non-erythroid granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells from 10-16 week old C57BL/6-S129Ola. Results provide insight into erythropoiesis and identify an expression pattern unique to erythroid progenitors.
