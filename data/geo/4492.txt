TITLE
FHH.Pkhd1 model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys from 30 day-old males representing SD, FHH, PCK, and FHH.Pkhd1 strains. The FHH.Pkhd1 strain carries the PCK Pkhd1 mutation but is resistant to the development of ARPKD. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that modulate ARPKD disease progression and severity.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
