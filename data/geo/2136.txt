TITLE
Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptide effect on dicots

SUMMARY
Analysis of dicot seedlings exposed for 30 minutes to necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptide (Nep1) from fungal plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Nep1 inhibited root and cotyledon growth and triggered cell death. Results provide insight into signaling networks involved in plant responses to Nep1.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana
