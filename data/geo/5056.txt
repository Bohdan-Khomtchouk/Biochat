TITLE
Morbidly obese and non-obese individuals: adipose stem cells

SUMMARY
Analysis of adipose stem cells (ASC) from subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) of morbidly obese and non-obese individuals. WAT serves as a reservoir for ASCs for cell renewal and repair. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which obesity affects subcutaneous WAT stem cells.
