TITLE
Response to low oxygen conditions

SUMMARY
Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 grown with 2% or 0.4% oxygen (O2), or without O2 but with nitrate instead. In cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs, PAO1 grows to high densities in mucopurulent material depleted in O2. Results provide insight into mode of growth in CF lungs.
