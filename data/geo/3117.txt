TITLE
Cardiomyocyte response to biomechanical stretch in vitro

SUMMARY
Analysis of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes subjected to both biomechanical stretch stress and pharmacological (i.e., phenylephrine, PE) induction of hypertrophy. Results provide insight into how mechanical stress is sensed and transduced in cardiomyocytes on the molecular level.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus
