TITLE
Pulmonary type II cell differentiation

SUMMARY
Analysis of epithelial cells isolated from 13 fetal lungs (13-20 wks old) and cultured in dexamethasone/cyclic AMP/isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI) for 72 hrs to promote type II cell differentiation. Mature alveolar type II cells that produce surfactant are critical for adaptation to extrauterine life.
