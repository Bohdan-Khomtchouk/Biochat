TITLE
MyD88-deficient macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide and E. coli

SUMMARY
Analysis of MyD88 null mutant macrophages treated with LPS or live E. coli. MyD88 transduces cell signaling events downstream of Toll-like receptors, a key component of host defense. Results suggest most of the host response to endotoxin or live bacteria is actually regulated independently of MyD88.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus
