TITLE
Pimecrolimus and betamethasone valerate effects on lesional skin of actopic dermatitis

SUMMARY
Analysis of skin biopsies from AD patients treated with pimecrolimus on 1 upper limb and betamethasone (BM) on the other upper limb. BM is clinically more effective but does not restore the skin barrier, compared to pimecrolimus. Results provide insight into mechanisms of action of both substances.
