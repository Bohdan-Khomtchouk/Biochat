TITLE
Dendritic cell responses to proinflammatory TNF cytokine or pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei antigens

SUMMARY
Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) treated with TNFa cytokine or T. brucei-derived, variant-specific surface glycoproteins (AnTat1.1 mfVSG or MiTat1.5 sVSG). Results provide insight into the partial maturation signatures of the differentially stimulated DCs.
