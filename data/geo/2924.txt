TITLE
Diethylstilbestrol effect on the prepubertal uterus: dose response

SUMMARY
Analysis of uteri of prepubertal animals treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES) at doses of 1, 10, or 1000 ug/kg/day. DES treatment of neonates results in the development of uterine adenocarcinomas. Results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the initiation of DES-induced carcinogenesis.
