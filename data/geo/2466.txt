TITLE
Carotid body and genetic background

SUMMARY
Comparison of carotid bodies (CBs) of A/J and DBA/2J animals. The CB is the primary hypoxic chemosensory organ. A/J animals are low responders to hypoxia, while DBA/2J animals are high responders. Results provide insight into the mechanisms regulating hypoxic sensitivity in the CB.
