TITLE
Fasting effect on multiple tissues: time course

SUMMARY
Analysis of brain, small intestine, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle subjected to 0-72 hrs of fasting. Adapting to starvation requires an interorgan integration of metabolic activity to protect vital organs. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptive response.
